A grieving tree is a giant skeletal tree made of the purest white
marble, weighing thousands of pounds. One of the greatest
inventions of the [[daashor|artificer]] [[Taruuzh]], a grieving tree is part
execution device, part torture device, a nearly inescapable
prison that sustains victims on the very edge of death. The
secrets to the tree’s construction were lost with Taruuzh’s death,
as was the art of controlling them. To [[attune|attunement]] to a grieving tree,
a character will have to rediscover these forgotten techniques.

The grieving tree has the following features.

* The tree can hold up to four creatures (or their corpses) at one time.
* The tree has a pool of life energy which it extracts from its imprisoned creatures. Whenever an imprisoned creature would die, the tree can spend some of that life energy to keep the creature alive.
* While you are within 120 feet of the tree, you can do any of the following:
** You can mentally control its branches. You can cause the tree to reach out and ensnare a creature within 20 feet of it, piercing it and stunning it until it is released. You can release a creature at will.
** You can command the tree to eviscerate its unfortunate prisoners, draining their life and blood as the branches shake and quiver. This heavily damages all imprisoned creatures and adds to the tree's pool of life energy.
** You can cast [[speak with dead]] on the corpse of a creature imprisoned in the tree for free at will. When you cast the spell in this manner, the corpse is compelled to speak truthfully.
