title: Externalist Theory

The energy of the [[plane]]s permeates [[Eberron]], and Externalist [[wizard]]s shape their [[spell]]s by drawing on this power. Where a [[Siberyan|Siberyan Theory]] harnesses ambient energy and shapes that into fire, an Externalist draws primal fire directly from [[Fernia]]. The elements of this magic—the components—are similar to those used in Siberyan magic. Words of power summon specific energies and eldritch gestures help to shape those forces, and ultimately it is the mind of the [[wizard]] that weaves these elements together and channels the power. But the Externalist asserts that the most effective source of power isn’t the blood of [[Siberys]]; it is the energy of the [[plane]]s.

Primitive Externalist techniques require a direct connection to the planes. Such magic can only be performed in or near a [[manifest zone]] or during a coterminous period. This is an important factor in the overall dominance of [[Siberyan magic|Siberyan Theory]]; when the people of [[Sarlona]] discovered that their spells no longer worked in new lands, they began developing new approaches. However, the energies of the [[plane]]s do permeate the world, albeit to a lesser degree—and more importantly, //creatures// are themselves tied to the planes. This is most clearly demonstrated when a mortal creature dreams—passing along its innate connection to [[Dal Quor]]—but can also be seen in the [[conscript|manifestation]]s of [[Shavarath]] and the [[shadow]]s of [[Mabar]], echoes of mortals in the [[plane]]s. So sophisticated Externalist [[wizard]]s don’t require access to [[manifest zone]]s or gain additional benefits from them (aside from whatever benefit the zone provides to all spellcasters); it’s primarily an academic point that the energy is flowing from an extraplanar source.

Externalist verbal components draw on elements of planar [[language]]s; depending on the power being shaped, it could use root syllables from [[Primordial]], [[Draconic]], [[Abyssal]], or even [[Quor]]. As with [[Siberyan theory|Siberyan Theory]] and Draconic, the spellcaster doesn’t have to //understand// these languages.

!! Pact Magic

Pact magic is an offshoot of Externalism, drawing power not from a [[plane]], but rather from a specific entity (such as an [[archfey]] or an [[overlord]]). Typically this is associated with [[warlock]]s, who are granted the ability to cast specific [[spell]]s; but it’s possible that a powerful entity could grant a [[wizard]] more general access to their power. Like [[Dominion|Dominion Theory]] wizards, Pact wizards will generally call out the source of their power in their invocations.

!! Animist Magic

Animists work with spirits, often [[fey]], [[elemental]]s, or [[ghost]]s; an animist might have a minor [[fire elemental]] that manifests when called on in the form of [[fire bolt]] or [[burning hands]]. Animists are often [[sorcerer]]s or even [[druid]]s as opposed to [[wizard]]s.
