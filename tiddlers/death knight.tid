The rarest of all [[Mabar]]an [[undead]], a death knight is a fearsome skeletal warrior that blends aspects of a [[ghost]] and a [[wraith]]. A death knight is formed when someone of deep devotion and martial skill—typically, a [[paladin]]—suffers intense tragedy leading to their death. This tragedy typically involves the character breaking their own oaths, blending loss with shame. A death knight can’t rest, in part because they won’t allow themselves to forget their shame. The [[divine power|divine magic]] they once channeled is replaced by the pure darkness of [[Mabar]]. Some find brief solace in taking vengeance on mortal enemies, but largely a death knight spends its time meditating on its pain.
