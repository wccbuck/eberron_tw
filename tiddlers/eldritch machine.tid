type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In a [[Cannith]] [[enclave]], a team of [[artificer]]s maintain a
[[creation forge]] that produces [[warforged]]. In the [[Shadow Marches]], [[druid]]s guard the seals that hold the [[daelkyr]]
at bay. In the sewers below [[Sharn]], a mad [[necromancer|necromancy]]
puts the final touches on a device that will turn the
city's residents into [[undead]]. Such contraptions are
categorized as eldritch machinesâ€”magical devices of
immense power that are too large to be moved easily. Eldritch machines are marvels of magic and engineering
that require special components and conditions to function. For example, a particular eldritch machine might
function only in a [[manifest zone]] where two or more
[[plane]]s are coterminous.

Ultimately, eldritch machines are plot devices that can
represent the culmination of a villain's master plan or a
last defense against evil.
