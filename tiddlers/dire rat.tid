[[Dire|dire beast]] rats are common menaces in dungeons and city sewers alike. They grow up to 2 feet long and usually weigh up to 25 pounds, though some individuals have been known to grow twice that size. Extra caution should be taken when fighting dire rats, as their bites can easily carry disease.
