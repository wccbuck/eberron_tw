The leader of the local [[Greensingers]] in [[Sylbaran]] is a non-binary [[Khoravar|half-elf]] who spent much of their life in the fey [[City of Rose and Thorn|Shae Loralyndar]] in the [[Towering Wood]]. Stillwater—a name they gave themselves when they came to Sylbaran—serves as an emissary to the [[fey]] of [[Silver Lake]], and teaches their initiates rituals and rites to help placate these fey. Like most [[Greensingers]], Stillwater encourages the people of [[Sylbaran]] to see the magic in the world, and to take joy in the stories unfolding all around them. When they aren’t teaching Greensinger aspirants, they are often found singing at [[Lake's Edge]].
