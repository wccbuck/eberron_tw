Duur’kala, or "dirge singers", are mighty [[bard]]s of the [[Kech Dhakaan|Heirs of Dhakaan]]. This ancient tradition was developed in the Empire of
[[Dhakaan]] (the legendary [[Jhazaal Dhakaan]] was a dirge singer), and is largely unknown beyond the [[goblinoid]]s of
the modern-day clans. The duur’kala are the historians, diplomats, and spiritual leaders of the empire, and their music is the most common form of magic among
the Dhakaani. 

Duur'kala are trained to inspire
their people and direct soldiers on the battlefield. Students of
both history and war, dirge singers use tales of past glory and
their knowledge of great victories to inspire their allies and
provide keen strategic insight, directing allies to strike when
enemies are weak.

As the magic manifests
mostly in women, duur’kala are often
called //gaanu duur,// “daughters of the
dirge,” and elders are referred to as
//niianu duur//, “mothers of the dirge.”

A dirge singer’s training often includes time within
the [[Uul Dhakaan]]. An [[uul’kur|dream key]] allows the novice duur’kala to
experience historical events within the dream or to study
with the memory-shades of duur’kala masters.
