Sovereign nations in Eberron are sometimes broken up into provinces, or distinct territories within that nation that act as administrative units. At one point, each of the [[Five Nations]] were considered provinces of united [[Galifar]]. Today, in [[Sarlona]], the [[provinces|Sarlonan province]] of [[Riedra]] and [[Syrkarn]] are named after twelve kingdoms that fell during the [[Sundering]].
