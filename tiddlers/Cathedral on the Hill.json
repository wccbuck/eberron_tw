Many of the rulers of Galifar would build an addition to the Cathedral as a way of\nshowing their piety. By the reign of King [[Jarot|Jarot ir'Wynarn]], it was a wonder\nindeed. Nine colossal statues encircled the temple, illusory displays within depicted scenes from the faith, and it held a vast collection of relics and artifacts. Since the [[Mourning]], the fate of the Cathedral and\nits treasures remains unknown.",
