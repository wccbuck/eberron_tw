Heken Askarda was a [[Daskara]]n monk devoted to [[Aureon]], who pioneered the development of utilitarian magic. Notably, she created [[spell]]s—at the time, [[uncommon-tier|spell tier]] spells—that produced the individual effects of [[prestidigitation]] (heating, chilling, cleaning, soiling, etc). These arcane advancements were rooted in [[sympathetic theory|Sympathetic Theory]]. Later generations would refine these spells to the level of [[cantrip|spell tier]] and ultimately to the versatile spell that people use today. Early [[wizard]]s were often focused on the combat applications of magic; Heken sought to show how [[Aureon]]’s gift could improve all aspects of life.
