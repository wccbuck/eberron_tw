Skycoaches are flying vehicles resembling small boats that range from rowboat-sized skycars to longship-scale tour coaches. They are often found in [[Sharn]], where the magical properties of that city's [[manifest zone]] aids their flight, but they were also seen in cities such as [[Eston]] in [[Cyre]] before the [[Mourning]].
