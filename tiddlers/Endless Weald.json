        "text": "The [[Forest Queen]] rules the Endless Weald within [[Thelanis]], an arboreal realm\ninhabited by [[dire beast]]s and wild [[fey]]. [[Satyr|satyr]]s and [[dryad]]s dance in clearings lit by gleaming [[sprite]]s, and peaceful beasts congregate by glittering springs. A series of paths connect the safe spaces within the woods. But for\nthose who stray from the path, the Endless Weald lives up to its\nname; such fools can be lost indefinitely, until the Queen takes\nmercy and leads them out.\n\nThe Weald often leaks\ninto the wood through [[manifest zone]]s found in deep forests;\nin such places, [[dryad]]s lurk in the trees and beasts may\npossess unusual cunning. Under the right circumstances,\ntravelers passing through a zone might even slip into the\nWeald. Such forests typically have well-worn paths that avoid\nthese pitfalls, thus strengthening the story of stay on the path.\nThe [[Greensinger|Greensingers]] [[druid]]s know rituals to connect a forest to\nthe Endless Weald, establishing a temporary manifest zone in\nany deep wood.
