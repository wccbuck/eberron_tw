Grimgraj is a crazed killer in [[Sharn]] who murders his victims with his bare hands. A [[hobgoblin]] monk of the [[Flayed Hand]], Grimgraj is obsessed with body alteration and is covered with numerous metal studs and piercings. His skin is an angry shade of red, and his arms and legs are unusually long. He secretly has a [[circlet of blasting]] implanted in his head. He makes a living doing smash-and-grab and second-story burglaries in [[Sharn]].
