Don't forget that the Martial Temple has a feretory (a building for housing reliquaries). From [[The First Semester]] session notes:

<<<
Besre the True, Saint of Dol Arrah, thwarted a death cult harvesting souls. They were doing nasty rituals in a holy ruin no one would set foot in (except those who didn't care about propriety). Besre shown a light on these activities. Her helmet is a relic, the Martial Temple has it.

The helm of Besre the True could be a [[sunlight armor]] in helmet form.
