type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The [[Cyran|Cyre]] spymaster Tyrala is Ambassador [[Jairan|Jairan ir'Dain]]’s mirror image. Where Jairan is proud and optimistic, Tyrala is obsessed with the survival of [[Cyre]] and will use any means necessary to achieve that goal, however questionable they may be. Jairan may ask a Cyran character in [[Sharn]] to perform an altruistic deed; Tyrala’s requests are often morally ambiguous, though they may have
more concrete results. 

Tyrala firmly believes that one of the other nations was behind the destruction of [[Cyre]], and she is determined to find out who did it and how, and to take a bitter vengeance. She uses this as a lever against a Cyran character—don't they want revenge for the hundreds of thousands of their people who were killed? Don't they want to prevent this from ever happening again? The embassy can draw on the discretionary funds held in the [[Kundarak Bank|Kundarak Bank of Sharn]], but it has little to offer—its primary currency is loyalty to the lost nation.
