type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The splints of this armor are inscribed with wards against [[scrying]] spells. When you are the target of a scrying spell, you are instantly made aware of it; make an attempt with [[Caution|approach]]. On a [[partial success]], you aren't affected by that spell. On a [[full success]], you can choose to allow the sensor to manifest, but the scryer sees you as a person or creature of your choice (no larger than a horse).
