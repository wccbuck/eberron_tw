        "text": "The Garden of [[Irian]] lives up to its name; it's a vast zoological garden\nfilled with foliage. It contains every plant that can be found\nin the Material Plane, along with many that can't. There\nare winding paths, peaceful pools, wondrous topiaries, and complicated hedge mazes. In contrast to the wilds of [[Lamannia]],\nthis is very carefully cultivated. The Garden is suffused with a\nsense of peace, beauty, and the wondrous things life can create. It is the realm of the [[Gardener]], an [[Architect]] whose principle is life.\n\nThe many layers of the Garden realm showcase various\nelements of fertility and the triumph of life. There are a few\nlayers that are slightly darker than the rest of [[Irian]], though still\nsuffused with dim light in their darkest cornersâ€”these reflect\nthe principle that life overcomes hardship. The message of the\nruined castle isn't to dwell on the destruction, but to see the\nflowers blooming on the walls. Most of the [[ember]]s in the region\ntake animal form, and [[ki-rin]] are the most common [[celestial]]s.\n\n",
