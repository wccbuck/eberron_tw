Their version of the [[Horned King|Tol Kharash]]—the \"Dawn Gorer\"—encouraged followers to fight with honor and to defend the weak, two traits rarely seen in [[Droaam]]. This interpretation of the King seems to have been more closely tied to [[Dol Arrah]] than the [[overlord]] of tyranny and cruelty. \n\nThe Dawn Harvest was destroyed by [[Maenya's Fist]] after refusing to accept [[Rhesh Turakbar]] as the [[warlord]] of their region; a few members of the clan survived and are now scattered across [[Droaam]].",
