Orcbone Fort in [[Breland]] valiantly attempts to secure the gap
between the [[Graywall Mountains]] and [[Silver Lake]].
Raised to prevent [[Droaam]] raiders from breaching the
borders, Orcbone is a grim fortress with steep walls,
surrounded by churned earth littered with bones.
Since its founding, Orcbone has known little peace.
[[Gaa'aram orc|orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[troll]]s, [[ogre]]s, and others spill through the
gap from Droaam and fling themselves at Orcboneâ€™s
walls, repulsed each time by its doughty defenders.
Orcbone holds fast, but soldiers dread assignments
here since there is little respite from the fighting.
