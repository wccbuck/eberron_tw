His acolytes consist of two teenagers and one crippled scribe. \n\nThe garrison was built to house a hundred soldiers, but currently there are only\neight [[templar]]s in residence. While these soldiers are supposed\nto protect the district from supernatural threats,\nMazin believes that they have been chosen by the\n[[Archierophant|Ythana Morr]] to keep an eye on the aging priestâ€”to\nmake certain that Mazin does not try to interfere\nwith the powers that control the [[Church|Silver Flame]] in [[Sharn]].\nWhile he is disillusioned with his superiors, Mazin\nstill believes in the ideals of the Church and does his\nbest to help those in need. If the party needs the aid\nof a true priest of the [[Silver Flame]], Mazin is one of\nthe few people who can help them.",
