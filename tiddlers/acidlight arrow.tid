This ammunition (arrow, bolt, etc.) is covered in an alchemical concoction that ignites upon impact, casting bright light within 5 feet of the point of impact (and dim light 5 feet beyond that) for up to 1 minute. A creature struck by the ammunition suffers acid burns while the ammunition remains lit. Invisible creatures struck by this ammunition are revealed while it remains lit. The ammunition remains lodged in a target it hits until the creature takes the time to remove and snuff it out.
