This ring is a simple band of black metal. A small "X" has been carved on the inside of the band.

When slipped onto one finger, the ring grows into a knife, short sword, or longsword, depending on the user's preference. The sword is the same black metal as the ring, and a low hum seems to emanate from the blade. Unless the ring is taken from their finger, the user cannot be disarmed.
