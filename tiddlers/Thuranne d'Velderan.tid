Thuranne d'Velderan, a scion of House [[Tharashk]], operates an
[[inquisitive]] agency in [[Warden Towers]], [[Sharn]]: [[Thuranne d'Velderan's Investigative Services]]. Her greatest
asset is an extensive network of contacts within the
Warden Towers garrison, which gives her access to
resources beyond the reach of most inquisitives. She
specializes in criminal investigation, and frequently
consults for the [[Watch|Sharn Watch]] to repay the many favors her
contacts have performed for her. She is not particularly
favored in House Tharashk, since she prefers to run
her own business than take on jobs for the house.
