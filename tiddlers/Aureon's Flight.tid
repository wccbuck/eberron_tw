Based in [[Menthis Plateau]], Aureon’s Flight is a [[skycoach]] company in [[Sharn]]. The company is notable for hiring students from [[Morgrave University]] as part-time pilots. Its pilots aren’t as fast or as ruthless in their work as their counterparts in [[Silverstreak|Silverstreak Skycoach Rental Company]] or the [[Swan]], but they’re often very familiar with the entertainment districts and have interesting stories to tell.
