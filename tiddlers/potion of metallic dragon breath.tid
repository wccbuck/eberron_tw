title: potion of metallic dragon breath
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

There are five types of this potion, each based on a different metallic [[dragon]]. The sluggish liquid glimmers like a polished slab of the corresponding metal.

After drinking this potion, you can exhale a 30-foot-cone of metallic dragon breath; each creature in the area must resist the effects of the breath weapon or be subject to an effect determined by the associated dragon (see the table below). The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed.
