Opilano is the sahar of [[Ardhmen]]â€”the nominal leader of the town, and perhaps [[Syrkarn]]s' most vocal ambassador. Recognizable in his ever-present cloak of bright green, the portly Opilano is a constant presence greeting travelers on the docks as the ships of the principalities come in. Though the trading post he founded even before the arrival of the first [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] ships still bears his name, its day-to-day operation is left to his daughter [[Ghillan]] and her [[eneko]] husband [[Ahmax Tumagin]].
