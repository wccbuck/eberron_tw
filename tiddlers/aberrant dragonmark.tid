The twelve [[dragonmark]]s are predictable, and their powers are generally constructive. But there is another kind of dragonmark, which is dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Aberrant marks often appear when people from different [[dragonmarked families|dragonmarked house]] produce a child, and for this reason such unions are forbidden by the [[Twelve]]. But aberrant dragonmarks can appear on members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two aberrant dragonmarks are exactly
alike—even if they grant the same power, they might manifest in different ways.

It usually takes time for a character to learn to control an aberrant mark, and in time, people might be hurt by it. This factor has led to the general superstition that people with aberrant dragonmarks are dangerous.

Aberrant marks are feared for another reason, too. Long ago, aberrant marks were more common and some held great powers. Aberrant leader [[Halas Tarkanan]] could devastate cities with powerful earthquakes. The [[Lady of the Plague]] wielded disease and commanded hordes of vermin. The [[dragonmarked house]]s
united in an inquisition called the [[War of the Mark]].
Some say this was a persecution of innocents, but most
feared the aberrants and stood by as the houses hunted
them down. Following the War of the Mark, aberrant
dragonmarks were few in number and relatively weak.
But since the [[Mourning]], aberrant marks have been appearing in greater numbers. 

!! Defining Tragedy

Whether it occurred the first time an aberrant 
mark manifested or before mastery of its abilities, aberrant marks are usually central
to a terrible tragedy that has had a deep and
lasting impact. The consequences of this event
could be public and social, an ongoing scar to a
reputation, or they could be secret and deeply
personal. Many a Child of Khyber has caused
the death of a loved one with their mark and
fled, ashamed of the embarrassment, but never
publicly tried with the crime. In their deepest
sleep, many aberrant marked relive these
nightmares. The road to self-forgiveness is often as fraught as the mark itself.

You can use the table below as
a source of inspiration to determine the tragic
past of your character. Work with your GM to
finalize the details of your personal tragedy and
to understand how it could play a role in your
ongoing story. Be sure to consider the nature of
your mark as you develop your story. It’s easy to
see how the [[fireball]] spell could be responsible
for a death, while a mark granting the [[suggestion]] spell
could still have unexpected consequences, like
triggering a riot or pushing an individual to the
brink of madness. 

|!<<dr d6>> |!Tragic Event |
| 1 |''Betrayal.'' The manifestation of your mark turned someone you care about against you. This could have been a lover, a child, a comrade-in-arms. Whoever it is, they now fear and despise you, while you hope that you can someday regain their affection. |
| 2 |''Death.'' Your aberrant mark caused a tragic death. This could have been someone you cared about, such as a lover or sibling, or you could have killed someone you hated, a tyrannical officer, a corrupt noble. Either way, you needed to flee from the consequences of that unintended murder. |
| 3 |''Massacre.'' You were responsible for the deaths of a large number of people. You may have triggered a riot or set fire to a crowded building. Do you feel personally responsible for each death, or do you not even know how many people died? |
| 4 |''Public Humiliation.'' Your mark manifested during a public and important event. You could have been giving a performance, negotiating a treaty, or conducting a sermon. Whatever it was, it ruined the event and you are now well-known as a wielder of an aberrant mark. |
| 5 |''Rift.'' The manifestation of your aberrant mark caused a deep rift between you and an organization you were once part of. You may have been excoriated from your [[dragonmarked house]], banished from your family home, or dishonorably discharged from the military. Beyond the broad enmity of the organization, you could have a specific rival within the group. |
| 6 |''Ruin.'' Your mark caused the destruction of something that was extremely precious. You could have destroyed your home, an important document, an arcane research project, or something else that was extremely valuable to you or to others. |
