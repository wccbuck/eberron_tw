        "text": "The Open Sky is the vast blue expanse from which the Azure\nSky of [[Syrania]] takes its name. The clear, bright, sunless sky shows no\nsigns of passing time; the moon [[Therendor]] can be seen, but it\ndoesn't move or have phases. Despite the Open Sky's seemingly\ninfinite space, it wraps around on itself, effectively making it\na 300-mile cube. So while it takes a significant time to travel\nbetween the farthest points, it is possible. There are no native\nthreats in the Open Sky, and all visitors to Syrania have the\nability to fly; the catch is knowing where to go, as there are\nhundreds of spires.",
