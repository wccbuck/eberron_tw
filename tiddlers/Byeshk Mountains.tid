tooltip: mountain range on the border of the Eldeen Reaches and Droaam
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This mountain range separates [[Droaam]] from the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. The mountains are named after the abundant veins of [[byeshk]] ore that are found here. The lustrous purple metal is particularly effective against [[aberration]]s.
