type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This mountain range separates [[Droaam]] from the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. The mountains are named after the abundant veins of [[byeshk]] ore that are found here. The lustrous purple metal is particularly effective against [[aberration]]s.

There are ten major flights (clans) of [[harpies|harpy]] living in the Byeshk Mountains: the Brass Talon, the Carrion Caller, the Crimson Wind, the Forgotten Choir, the Haunting Song, the Last Chant, the Last Dirge, the Rotwing, the [[Stormsinger|Stormsingers]], and the Wind Howler flights. Only four of these flights (Carrion Callers, Last Dirge, Rotwings, Stormsingers) have pledged loyalty to the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]]; these harpies who left the mountains to “sing Katra's song” have embraced her vision and are thrilled to be building a nation with their voices. The other flights are in varying degrees of opposition. The largest and most dangerous of the mountain flights is the Wind Howlers. The Howlers’ leader, Callain of the Bloody Word, despises the hags and interferes with their plans at any opportunity.
