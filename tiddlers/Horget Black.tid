Horget Black was once the High Prince of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], the most powerful and charismatic prince in the region. It was he who brought House [[Thuranni]] to [[Regalport]] twenty-five years ago. Just over ten years ago, he was challenged for the title of High Prince by [[Ryger ir'Wynarn]], and lost a limb in the resulting duel. Today, he has accepted his defeat, serving Ryger in Regalport as a trusted advisor.
