Also known as the Winter Palace, Castle Arakhain is the favored retreat of the [[Brelish|Breland]] [[royal family|Wynarn family]] when they choose to leave [[Wroat]]. Grand balls are held here, where esteemed moguls, entertainers, and adventurers mingle with [[nobility|Nobility of the Five Nations]]. King [[Boranel ir'Wynarn]] himself typically dwells in Arakhain two times per year: he spends the winter month of [[Vult]] in Arakhain, remaining through the end of [[Long Shadows]]; and he also generally comes to the palace at the beginning of [[Barrakas]] for the [[Hunt]], the festival of [[Balinor]]. Boranel loves to hunt, and the gamekeepers of Arakhain spend most of the year searching for a beast that will prove a worthy opponent.

While King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] rarely visits Castle Arakhain otherwise, some member of the royal family is usually in residence. The king's youngest daughter, [[Brela|Brela ir'Wynarn]], has resided here since childhood. She will be turning twenty this year ([[998 YK|Khorvaire calendar]]) on the 9th of [[Rhaan]]—which is also the [[holiday]] [[Boldrei's Feast]]—and she expects to have the grandest celebration ever seen in the western frontier.

!! Interesting Things About Castle Arakhain

* The west wing of Castle Arakhain suffered significant damage in 996 YK, when it was burned by insurgents tied to the [[Swords of Liberty]]. The cell leader known as [[Beggar Dane|Beggar Dane (Swords of Liberty)]] has claimed responsibility.
* The [[Wynarns|Wynarn family]] love to hunt. The lands to the south of the castle are reserved for farming, but the hills and the plains to the north have been stocked with a wide array of [[beast]]s, [[monstrosities|monstrosity]], and other surprises. The castle itself includes massive stables and kennels, including a pair of [[ghost tiger]]s and three massive [[magebred|magebreeding]] bears.

Many believe that tower is somewhere in the Arakhain Hills.

!! Businesses and Locations

Castle Arakhain takes its name from the adjacent Arakhain Hills. The village of Arakhain began as an iron mining community. The mine was tapped out centuries ago, and today the village primarily exists to support the palace, growing grain and maintaining the beasts brought to the region for hunting. Arakhain is a tiny community, but thanks to the presence of the castle it does have a [[Sivis]] [[message station|speaking stone]] (''Stone 65'') and a [[Jorasco]] [[healer|Healers Guild]], ''Izra d'Jorasco''. The local inn is called ''The Queen’s Rest''; thanks to the presence of the castle, it has a remarkably deep cellar and can provide meals of extremely high quality. The royal family recently rejected [[Ghallanda]]’s proposal to open a [[Gold Dragon Inn]] in Arakhain, much to the relief of Queen’s Rest innkeeper Wil Wrighten.
