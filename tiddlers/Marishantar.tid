type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Marishantar is a [[rakshasa]] of the [[Lords of Dust]] who poses as a [[dragonmark]]ed heir of House [[Orien]]'s [[Transportation Guild]] named Dekker. This [[fiend]] sports a bogus
[[Siberys mark|dragonmark]] and conceals that it uses demonic teleportation magic to and from [[Stormreach]] rather than using the mark. 

Marishantar is a servant of [[Sul Khatesh]], an [[overlord]] with a number of followers hidden in House [[Orien]] and across [[Aundair]].
Marishantar has no direct ties to other [[rakshasa]]s in
[[Stormreach]]. It serves the interests of Sul Khatesh and
has no need to manipulate the [[Storm Lords]] or delve
into the city’s mysteries. As a supposed heir of Siberys
in the [[Transportation Guild]], Marishantar has access
to [[Khorvaire]]’s rich and powerful, and over the course
of centuries, it has used its skills and spells to draw
knowledge from its clients and to plant ideas.

Marishantar is essentially a tourist with no long-term interests in [[Stormreach]]. It's just passing through on assignment, looking forward to the day when it can use its connections in the service of the [[Keeper of Secrets|Sul Khatesh]].
