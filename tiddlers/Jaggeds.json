        "text": "In the precise center of the [[Vale of the Inner Sun]], a ring of enormous obsidian monoliths surrounds and looms over a crimson river. These spires, curved like vast claws or teeth, are known as the Jaggeds. The mutated [[orc]]s, [[human]]s, [[half-orc]]s, and [[dwarves|dwarf]] that live in the caves along the Jaggeds were born in the [[Mror Holds]] and the [[Shadow Marches]], but few of them have any real memories of their former lives. They are locked in what they consider a sacred battle, a test put to them by [[Khyber]] to harden them for a great conflict that is yet to come. The occupants of each jagged spire fight against the others, but the battle is a carefully organized ritual; enemies that fall are spared, and some of the warriors have been fighting these daily battles for hundreds of years.\n\nThe people of the Jaggeds are ambivalent toward the [[elves|elf]] of [[Shae Taral]], but most will greet other strangers with homicidal fury, convinced that the intruders are the vanguard of the force they have been preparing to fight. Bands of raiders from the Jaggeds often roam the vale, looking for challenges and hunting the most dangerous beasts of the region.",
