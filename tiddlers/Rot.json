There's a community of [[wererats|therianthrope]] thriving in the Rot,\nand there could be a small outpost of the [[Children of Winter]]\nwho found their way here. While the Rot is a symbol of death and decay, it's entirely natural, and [[undead]] have no place here. It's possible a [[necromancer|necromancy]] could arrive here, hoping to animate the massive corpses; however, this would violate the\ntheme of the [[plane]], and if there's any higher power at work\nin Lamannia, it would certainly direct forces to counter this.\nWhile most layers of Lamannia are free from disease, disease\nitself is part of nature; a [[manifest zone]] tied to the Rot could\nspread plagues into the surrounding region.",
