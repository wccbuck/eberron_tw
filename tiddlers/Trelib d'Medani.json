He is a tall [[half-elf]] with a slight paunch, a full head of jet black hair, and a brazen mustache to match.\n\nA longtime friend of King [[Boranel ir'Wynarn]] of [[Breland]], Baron Trelib d'[[Medani]] knows exactly what this friendship costs him: anti-Medani suspicion among the other [[dragonmarked house]]s and diplomatic difficulties for Boranel. Yet he remains at the king’s side.\n\nSome suspect darker motives for Trelib’s close connection to the Brelish crown, and wonder just how many Medani agents and sympathizers live and work in [[Brokenblade Castle]]. But most court observers say there’s a simpler reason for Trelib’s omnipresence. King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] has charged Trelib with figuring out who murdered Boranel’s first wife, Queen Chaseva. House [[Medani]] elders know that Trelib is consumed with finding the killer, even to the point of neglecting house business.",
