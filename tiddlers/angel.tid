An angel is a celestial paragon of virtue, honor, and honesty. Its sublime beauty and presence can drive awestruck onlookers to their knees. Yet angels are destroyers too, and their appearance portends doom as often as it signals hope.

Most angels are immune to magical effects that [[charm]] or cause fear, and can communicate telepathically and speak all [[language]]s.

Angels native to different [[plane]]s express different aspects. 

* The angels of [[Daanvi]] represent law in the service of justice and the greater good, and serve as local authorities.
* In [[Fernia]], angels represent the comfort fire offers: its life-giving warmth, the light that holds back the shadows.
* The angels of [[Irian]] embody the general principles of light, hope, and compassion.
* In [[Shavarath]], angels are living symbols of the endless fight for justice. Different cohorts within the Legion of [[Justice]] represent specific concepts within that broad ideal, such as kindness to fallen foes, or protecting civilians and avoiding collateral damage.
* The neutral angels of [[Syrania]] aren't champions of justice or bringers of hope; rather, they're observers and scholars, defined by their [[domain|Syranian domain]] of study. Syranian [[dominion]]s are the variety that can fall and become [[radiant idol]]s.

Angels may honor and serve the [[Sovereign Host]], but like all other creatures, have no direct access to them. Even angels must take their existence on faith.
