What few remember is how the original proverb ends: ‘But it takes gold to first see the anvil forged.’ ”//\n\n!\n\nMorrikan has ruled House [[Kundarak]] for more than a century—he is the only head of a [[dragonmarked house]] (besides the Houses of [[Shadow|Mark of Shadow]]) who remembers life before the [[Last War]]. Accordingly, he has an attitude that outsiders would call world-weary. His memory is sharp enough that he remembers the last four times over the century that his advisors have suggested a given course of action. In keeping with the nature of his house, Morrikan is cautious and circumspect.\n\nAlthough Morrikan is known for caution, once he has decided on a course of action he backs it to the hilt. In the last five years, he has been urging younger members who bear the [[Mark of Warding]] to travel to the [[Eldeen Reaches]] and the [[Shadow Marches]] to establish “ties of honor” with the [[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]] [[druid]]s. A natural connection exists between the work of the Gatekeepers and the work of House [[Kundarak]]: The Gatekeepers are essentially engaged in a large-scale warding project, and more specifically their expertise in dealing with [[aberration]]s might provide insight into the [[Realm Below]] problem.",
