Many of those named in the codicils are living openly elsewhere in [[Khorvaire]]. In the two years since the war’s end, under the leadership of the inscrutable [[Taldor d'Medani]], the Basilisk’s Gaze has apprehended dozens of\nterrorists and war criminals, but that’s only a small\nportion of the names listed in the codicils.",
