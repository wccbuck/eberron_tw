        "text": "Like other [[daelkyr]], [[Valaara]] is bound within a [[demiplane]] in\n[[Khyber]]. However, Valaara has bred burrowing worms that chew\nthrough the fabric of reality, carving a web of passages between\nher Deepest Hive and the world above. An organization that\ndiscovers the upper layers of these tunnels could use them to\nmove swiftly across the world, entering a tunnel in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], traveling five miles, and emerging in [[Sarlona]] or the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. Smugglers or explorers might make use of this wonder, never knowing what lies in the deeper tunnelsâ€”until Valaara's minions seize them, or until they are consumed by the psychic influence of the Crawling Queen. While tunnels to the Deepest Hive can appear anywhere that suits the story, they are also less permanent than the ties between [[Eberron]] and\nthe realms of many other daelkyr. It's possible to collapse a passage and break a connection.\n\nThe upper tunnels of Valaara's realm are usually formed\nof fused glass-like material, then as explorers delve deeper,\nthey find the walls formed of chitin and muscle, with insects\nswarming across every surface. One might discover pulsing\ncocoons, nests of slumbering [[purple worm]]s, or chambers lined\nwith thousands of glowing eggs. And in the heart is the Deepest\nHive itself, where Valaara weaves its webs and conducts its\nsinister experiments.",
