        "text": "Expert crafters display wares of incomparable beauty and quality in the city of Io'lokar’s many markets, and virtually any [[magic item]] of the GM’s choosing can be found at a crafter’s stall. However, the markets of Io’lokar operate exclusively on the city’s system of commonwealth and barter. For the most part, city folk simply take what they need of their fellow citizens’ wares, knowing that the work they do is fair trade for these goods. New visitors to the city can attempt to barter their own services or goods, but are often limited to looking on enviously as the [[Io'lokari]] shop.",
