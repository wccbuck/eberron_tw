For centuries, the [[Blademarks Guild]] of House\nDeneith has governed the mercenary trade. While warriors with the [[Mark of Sentinel]] are among its most elite\nforces, House Deneith brokers the services of a wide\nrange of soldiers, including [[Valenar]] war bands and the\n[[goblin|goblinoid]]s of [[Darguun]]. Beyond the battlefield, the [[Defenders Guild]] provides exceptional bodyguards for those\nwho can afford their services. House Deneith is also\nrenowned for its [[Sentinel Marshals]], agents who hold\nthe authority to pursue criminals and enforce the law\nacross the length of [[Khorvaire]]. The Sentinel Marshals\nhold the honor of the house in their hands. Being a Marshal is a privilege, and it comes with high expectations.\n\nDespite its might and the desire of some house members to flex their military muscles, House Deneith has\nalways maintained absolute neutrality, selling its services to all sides of a conflict. Baron [[Breven d'Deneith]]\nshows no inclination of using the massive, [[chimera]]-marked military forces of his house for his own ends,\nbut he's surrounded by aggressive advisors who would\nlike to see a Deneith ruling all [[Khorvaire]]. House Deneith is also caught in an escalating rivalry with House [[Tharashk]], as it edges into the mercenary trade. \n\n!! History of House {{!!title}}\n\nThe first humans to exhibit [[dragonmark]]s were members of a militant noble family with ancestral lands in what is now [[Karrnath]]. With the [[Dragonmark of Sentinel|Mark of Sentinel]] bolstering their military prowess, the Deneith family\nconquered most of the region; only famine prevented\nthem from carving out their own kingdom in what is\nnow western Karrnath. The Deneith homeland was\nalso the home of [[Karrn the Conqueror]]. Although\nhe was not a member of the family, House Deneith\npledged fealty to Karrn during his rise to power.\nWhen [[Galifar I|Galifar Wynarn]] united the [[Five Nations]], he charged\nthe house with the protection of his vast new realm.\n\n!!! The Last War\n\nMost members of House Deneith\nare culturally [[Karrnath]]i, but the house refused to\nchoose sides in the [[Last War]]. Instead, House Deneith\noffered mercenaries from its [[Blademarks Guild]] to\nall of the [[Five Nations]]. Deneith crafted its contracts\nto ensure that Deneith fighters would never cross\nswords with other Deneith. One [[Cyran|Cyre]] general was\ninfuriated when the blademarks under his command\nwouldn’t attack a Deneith-guarded garrison. The\nCyrans attacked the blademarks who refused to fight,\nbut were routed by the combined forces of the blademarks and the Deneith garrison guards.\n\nHouse Deneith generally remains at arm’s length\nfrom political maneuvering among the other [[dragonmarked house]]s. But since the [[Last War]], it has started to make cautious moves against House [[Cannith]] and\nHouse [[Tharashk]]. The reason is simple: In the latter\ndays of the war, both made significant inroads against\nDeneith’s dominance in the soldiers-for-hire market.\nEvery [[warforged]] soldier built by House Cannith and\nevery (sometimes monstrous) mercenary offered by\nHouse Tharashk is direct competition.\n\n!!
