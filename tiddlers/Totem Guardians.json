These are the defenders of [[Totem Beach]] and the [[Great Barrier|Great Barrier Mountains]] of [[Argonnessen]]. Their recruits are drawn from the dreams of dragonspeaker priests who receive dream-visions ordering particular warriors to Totem Beach to join the guardians. In a few special cases, [[dragon]]s have personally visited a tribe to call a [[Seren]] to the guardians.",
