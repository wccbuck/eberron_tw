title: belt of troglodyte stench
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While you wear this scaly belt, you emit a terrible stench that sickens nearby creatures. Any creature other than yourself, a [[troglodyte]], or a creature that can't smell that moves within 5 feet of you must resist the overwhelming stench or else become extremely nauseous and temporarily debilitated.
