Aasimar are humanoids with an angelic spark in their souls, which grants them supernatural power. They are a people of otherworldly visages, often with luminous features that reveal their [[celestial]] heritage. 

Divine magic is usually the product of deep faith and unyielding
conviction, but an aasimar has a direct tie to a source of divine
power and receives guidance from a celestial entity. Usually,
these gifts aren't hereditary, and you can't necessarily identify
an aasimar in [[Eberron]] by their appearance; there is no single
recognized trait that defines an aasimar, and no reliable way of
producing one. While the existence of aasimar may seem to fly
in the face of Eberron's distant gods, it's important to remember
that an aasimar needs no direct connection to a deity. An
aasimar draws power from a divine energy source, and their
spiritual guide is a celestial being—an [[angel]], a [[couatl]], or similar
spirit. The aasimar may be marked as a champion of the faith,
but even they can't prove the existence of the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]].

As a general rule, aasimar are so rare and diverse in their
appearance and traits that you wouldn't be recognized by
the common populace. However, most people devoted to a
particular [[religion]] will recognize an aasimar associated with
their faith when you manifest your divine gifts. Aasimar are
usually seen as blessed beings by those who share your faith,
and they will likely assume that you are a devoted servant
of that faith called to serve a divine purpose. By contrast,
people who don't share your faith may not recognize your
nature; for example, few outsiders are familiar with the
manifestations of a [[Blood of Vol]] aasimar.

Your celestial nature might draw you into schemes or danger.
Authority figures tied to your faith may have their own plans for
you. There could be prophecies you're expected to fulfill. Or you
could be targeted by enemies you never knew you had; perhaps
the [[Lords of Dust]] need the blood of a Sovereign aasimar to
complete a ritual that's performed only once in a generation. 

!! Aasimar Origins

Aasimar have an innate connection to a divine power and a
celestial guide. But when and how did this manifest? Were
you born an aasimar, or was the power thrust upon you?
The table below presents a few possibilities.

| !<<dr d6>> |!Aasimar Origin |
| 1 |''Aasimar Bloodline.'' Typically, aasimar nature isn't hereditary... but in your case, it is. Where did your lineage begin? How large is your family? Are you closely tied to the church and celebrated for your gifts? Or was your family cast out long ago, branded as heretics and apostates? |
| 2 |''Noble Birth.'' While your line manifests an aasimar only once in a generation or so, your family is well known for its piety and virtue. Other members of your family might be [[cleric]]s or [[paladin]]s, and your family estate could be in a [[manifest zone]] tied to [[Daanvi]], [[Irian]], or [[Syrania]]. Are you a proud heir of your family, or do you chafe at its noble traditions? |
| 3 |''Blessed Event.'' You developed your gifts at birth or as a child. Your community had no history of producing aasimar, but the people celebrated you and your gifts. Do you maintain close ties to your home, or was it destroyed by the [[Last War]] or forces of evil?  |
| 4 |''Celestial Connection.'' You weren't born an aasimar. Your aasimar nature manifested after you had an encounter with the [[celestial]] being who serves as your guide. You agreed to serve as this celestial's hand on Eberron, and you have a stronger tie to it than is typical for an aasimar. What does this celestial want, and why did it choose you? |
| 5 |''Experiment.'' Your gifts weren't given freely; they were seized through arcane science. Perhaps House [[Vadalis]] is trying to produce divine souls. Maybe you've been fused to a [[Khyber shard|dragonshard]] that contains the essence of a trapped celestial. Did you volunteer for these experiments, or are you a victim? Do you work with your celestial guide, or do you consider it to be your servant? |
| 6 |''Mysterious Past.'' You remember absolutely nothing about your childhood. Perhaps you awoke in the [[Mournland]], or were the only survivor of a terrible battlefield. Your only clues to your past and your purpose come from dreamlike visions from your celestial guide. Can you unravel the mystery? Are you sure you want to? |

!! Faiths and Aasimar

As an aasimar, you're tied to a divine force... but which one?
The [[Undying Court]] and the [[Silver Flame]] are both known
sources of divine power, but they are quite different from one
another. This section looks at the major religions of Eberron
and how aasimar are typically tied to each faith.

!!! The Blood of Vol

As an aasimar of the [[Blood of Vol]], you weren't chosen by some
distant [[angel]]; your power comes from within. The potential
for divinity lies within you, and it is your own divine spark
that guides you on the path toward ascension.

//''Appearance.''// Seeker aasimar appear [[human]]. Some have
a pale, almost [[vampiric|vampire]] complexion, while others appear
exceptionally vibrant and healthy. Your eyes often glow when
channeling divine energy, and your energy manifestations are
typically red or black.

//''Spiritual Guide.''// Your guide is an aspect of yourself; think of it as the
god you could become, working to guide you toward ascension.
Guidance usually takes the form of instincts or visions; you can't
converse with it directly. Is your guide primarily concerned with
your own ascension? Or is it driven by the Seeker principles of
protecting your community and opposing death?

!!! The Silver Flame

The [[Silver Flame]] is the most common source of aasimar in
Eberron. Some believe that [[Tira Miron]] was an aasimar of the
Silver Flame; it's likewise possible that all Keepers of the Silver
Flame become aasimar when they assume their post. Most
followers of the Flame have heard stories of champions with
rainbow wings, and they will place their trust in you once your
true nature is revealed.

//''Appearance.''// Typically, Flame aasimar appear entirely
[[human]] (or [[orc]], if appearing among the [[Ghaash'kala]]) until they reveal their rainbow-feathered wings. However, some Flame aasimar manifest other couatl traits,
like having rainbow feathers instead of hair or serpentine
eyes. There are rumors that there's an entire race of serpent-people—the [[shulassakar]]—devoted to the Silver Flame. The
manifestations of a Flame aasimar's energy are either silvery-white or prismatic.

//''Spiritual Guide.''// Typically, your guide is a [[couatl]]—one of the beings
who first brought the Flame into existence. Another option
is that you are in touch with the Voice of the Flame itself, the
ascended spirit of [[Tira Miron]]. The primary purpose of the
Flame is to protect the innocent from supernatural threats. Is
this what your guide encourages you to do? Or do you have a
greater purpose?

!!! The Sovereign Host

[[Host|Sovereign Host]] aasimar are chosen by a particular Sovereign, or at least, by a [[celestial]] devoted to that Sovereign. As a Host aasimar,
you are encouraged to act as an avatar of that Sovereign,
embodying their virtues and inspiring the faithful. If you're an
aasimar of [[Dol Arrah]], be the most virtuous warrior possible. If
you're an aasimar of [[Aureon]], acquire knowledge and use it to
guide others and strengthen civilization. Followers of the Host
generally show respect to Sovereign aasimar, and may ask you
for assistance.

//''Appearance.''// Host aasimar typically appear fully human,
usually conforming to the common image of the archetype the
Sovereign embodies—the sturdy blacksmith for [[Onatar]], the
wise sage for [[Aureon]], the weathered farmer for [[Arawai]]. Energy
manifestations are typically golden light.

//''Spiritual Guide.''// Your guide is a celestial devoted to the same
Sovereign as you—typically an [[angel]] of [[Irian]] or [[Syrania]]. They
will encourage you to embody the virtues of the Sovereign you
represent. Do they have any deeper purpose for you?

!!! The Undying Court

You have been chosen by one of the ascendant councilors of
the [[Undying Court]]—one of your [[deathless]] elven ancestors—and
imbued with a fraction of their power. You serve as their hands
and eyes in the world beyond [[Aerenal]], while proving your worth
to ascend to the Court yourself.

//''Appearance.''// As an aasimar of the Undying Court, you
physically resemble an [[Aereni]] elf. Most Aereni aasimar appear
like normal elves, with luminous eyes and a general aura of
health. However, you could have a desiccated appearance,
similar to a [[mummy]]—even though you are still fully alive and
healthy. Your energy manifestations are typically blue or violet.

//''Spiritual Guide.''// Your spirit guide is one of the [[deathless]] councilors
of the [[Undying Court]], quite possibly one of your own distant
ancestors. Do they want you to serve the general interests of
Aerenal and the Undying Court, or have they recruited you as
their personal agent? Do they want you to help in a struggle with
a deathless rival, in pursuit of the [[Draconic Prophecy]], or in a
conflict over corruption within the court itself?

Elves don't dream, but your ancestor can speak to you when
you trance. Your ancestor was once mortal themselves, and your
relationship may be more direct and personal than the typical
relationship between aasimar and guide.

!! Planetouched Aasimar

When you were born, you were imbued with a sliver of the
immortal essence of an [[angel]]. Most likely this was an accident:
you were conceived in a [[manifest zone]] at the precise moment
the angel's physical form was destroyed, and while it reformed,
a fragment of its spirit went into you. But it's also possible that
the angel chose you to be its avatar or agent in the Material
Plane. Either way, this spirit embodies the positive aspects of
the concept of the [[plane]], and it encourages you to embody that principle.

As a planetouched aasimar, your appearance is more exotic
than most other aasimar. You have an alien aspect that reflects
the plane and the angel you're tied to, and this becomes more
dramatic when you manifest your abilities. Only scholars and
sages might recognize you for what you are, while common folk
will generally view you with curiosity.

The following planes are most likely to produce aasimar.

!!! [[Daanvi]]

You're tied to an angel that embodies the concept
of law in the service of justice. Your skin and hair have a
metallic sheen, often copper or bronze, and your wings have
the appearance of clever clockwork. Your instincts drive you to fight for the greater good, but within the structure of the law. Your guide could
be a [[planetar]]—a judge on an inevitable tribunal, who urges
you to enforce the law. Or you could be bound to one of the
[[solar]]s of the [[Panopticon]], each bound to enforce justice within
a particular plane. [[Hazariel]], the Solar of [[Syrania]], has exiled
[[radiant idol]]s to the Material Plane; perhaps it's concerned
about the damage these fallen angels are doing on [[Eberron]]
and is grooming you to deal with them.

!!! [[Fernia]]

Your guide embodies the positive aspects of fire:
the flame that provides light and warmth, driving back the
darkness. Fernian aasimar typically have crimson skin,
and eyes or hair that burn with cold flame. Your guide drives
you to provide comfort to the frightened and to battle forces
of darkness. Fernian aasimar are often [[sorcerer]]s wielding
elemental flame.

!!! [[Irian]]

You're bound to an angel of light, a spirit that inspires
hope and life. Your skin and hair have a luminous appearance
and your wings are formed from pure light; when you cast the
[[light]] [[cantrip|spell]], you can describe it as your body itself radiating
light. Your guide could be a lesser angel, or more unusually, you might be tied
to one of the [[Architect]]s of Irian. [[Araam]], the Architect of the
[[Refuge]], would urge you to provide hope to the hopeless. The
[[Gardener]] would inspire you to heal the injured and fight for
life. The [[Dawn Empress]] would charge you to achieve your
full potential and help others do the same. Any of these could
also direct you to battle the forces of [[Mabar]]—life-draining
[[undead]] and other dark forces. Prince [[Lorrister]] of the
[[Lhazaar Principalities]] is an Irian aasimar who has risen
to rule the principality he calls the [[Heavenly Fleet]].

!!! [[Mabar]]

You're connected to an angel that's trapped in
Mabar and slowly being transformed by the plane's dark
powers. Choose any other plane from this section; the angel
is originally from that plane, and you have a generally similar
appearance to other aasimar touched by that plane—but your
colors are dull, as if the light is being leached away from you,
and your eyes are pure darkness. Your guide still inspires you
to follow the principles of its plane of origin, but it's fighting
against Mabar's overwhelming despair and a hunger to drain
the light and life from mortal creatures; when you inflict necrotic damage to enemies, you're channeling this energy to your guide. Your guide might hope you can someday release it from Mabar,
though no immortal has ever escaped its corruption before. Or
it could simply encourage you to follow the general principles
of its plane of origin—balanced against its growing hunger and
despair. 

!!! [[Shavarath]]

The angels of Shavarath are martial champions.
Your skin and hair have the appearance of iron or steel.
Your wings are formed from knives. If your guide is from the
Legion of [[Justice]], it urges you to fight for a just cause. If your guide is tied to the Legion
of [[Freedom]], it urges you to battle all forms of tyranny and
oppression. This can be an interesting option for a hexblade [[warlock]]; your guide has
given you their celestial weapon, and it urges you into battle.

!!! [[Syrania]]

You are tied to a [[dominion]] of Syrania. Each
dominion has a particular domain, reflecting its area of
influence and interest; is your dominion an angel of war? Of
nature? Of commerce? What's its specialty within that broad
domain? Syranian aasimar typically have classic feathered wings; however, your appearance might reflect the domain of your guide in some way. Your guide
will urge you to exemplify its domain—if it's the Angel of
Swords, it will want you to master the sword! It also observes
the world through your eyes, and it might send you to observe
events or take actions tied to its domain.
