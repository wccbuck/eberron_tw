You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and up to two weapons. Once you have completed this ritual and bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same [[plane]] of existence, you can summon that weapon at will, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.
