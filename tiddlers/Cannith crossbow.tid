During the [[Last War]], House [[Cannith]] pioneered a unique line of [[crossbow]]s. The crossbow barrel interior and quarrels are both engraved with arcane sigils. When the quarrel moves against the barrel, the symbols create an arcane interaction—a formula that adds kinetic energy to the bolt. The only force the prod itself has to provide is the initial push of the bolt down the barrel, a spark that triggers the arcane interaction. Because of this design, a [[Cannith]] crossbow doesn’t look like a medieval crossbow; the “bow” is a relatively small component of the weapon.

The standard weapons in this line are the ''Spark'' ([[hand crossbow]]), the ''Lightning'' ([[light crossbow]]), and the ''Thunderbolt'' ([[heavy crossbow]]). During the [[Last War]], [[Aundair]] and [[Cyre]] both made extensive use of these weapons, while [[Karrnath]] and [[Breland]] held to the more mundane design of the [[SAC-12]].

House [[Cannith]]'s [[spellbolt]]s, ammunition that can deploy an arcane spell on impact, are a recent invention that require the use of Cannith crossbows to function.
