The least of the <<navAndScrollToHeader modron "hierarch modron">>s, decatons monitor the physical well-being of base [[modron]]s. Two stubby legs support their spherical bodies, and ten mechanical tentacles sprout out from their rounded frames in all directions. Their heads contain ten eyes to readily observe the operations of surrounding base modrons. In emergencies, a decaton can discharge a bolt of electricity from each of its ten eyes, synchronizing them to deadly effect.

Like all [[modron]]s, {{!!title}}s have [[truesight]] out to 120 feet and can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to their nature or their instructions. <<navAndScrollToHeader modron "Hierarch modron">>s can also freely fly and hover. Most hierarchs can cast some combination of the following spells: [[clairvoyance]], [[command]], [[detect magic]], [[dimension door]], [[dispel magic]], [[mending]], [[teleport]], and [[wall of force]].
