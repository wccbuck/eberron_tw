Celestials are [[immortal]] creatures of good formed in the expanse of [[Siberys]], or in another plane such as [[Shavarath]], [[Irian]], or [[Syrania]]. Celestials cannot be destroyed; unless they are bound, they will always reform some time later after being killed.

Included among their number are [[angel]]s, [[couatl]]s, and [[pegasi|pegasus]].
