You have achieved such mastery over certain "signature" spells that you can cast them with little effort.

* Choose two [[uncommon-tier|spell tier]] spells that you know. You can cast these spells for free at will.
* Choose two [[rare-tier|spell tier]] spells that you know. You only need to expend 1 [[stress]] to cast these spells rather than 2.
