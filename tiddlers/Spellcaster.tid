The Spellcaster [[talent]] allows you to cast [[spell]]s. When you take this talent, you gain spells according to the table below such that the total number of "spell points" adds up to ''4'':

| ![[Spell Tier|spell tier]] | !Spell Points |
| Common or Uncommon | 2 (or 1; see below) |
| Rare | 4 |

Typically, a player character who takes this talent gains two common- or uncommon-tier spells, or a single rare-tier spell.

Subject to GM approval, you might only need to spend 1 of your four spell points on a common- or uncommon-tier spell if it is highly niche. Examples include [[blessed birth]] or [[hide from dragons]]â€”spells that might only be useful in very specific and unlikely circumstances. Also, a spell that is very mechanically similar to another spell you already have might also be considered for this option.

You can take this talent multiple times to gain access to more spells. Gain access to higher-tier spells by taking the [[Spellcaster 2]] or [[Spellcaster 3]] talents. To cast spells you already know at a higher tier, consider the [[Spell Enhancement]] talents.
