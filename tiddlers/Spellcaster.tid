The Spellcaster [[talent]] allows you to cast [[spell]]s. Choose ''any two'' of the following options:

* Gain one [[common- or uncommon-tier|spell tier]] spell.
* Gain the ability to cast two spells you already know (common or uncommon only) at one [[tier|spell tier]] higher. Some spells, like [[guidance]] or [[charm]], have specific instructions on what a higher-tier version of that spell can do. Others, such as [[scorching ray]], are simply more powerful and destructive at higher tiers.
* Gain two highly niche common- or uncommon-tier spells, or one highly niche rare-tier spell; this is highly dependent on your campaign and subject to GM approval. Examples include [[blessed birth]] or [[hide from dragons]]â€”spells that might only be useful in very specific and unlikely circumstances. A spell that is very mechanically similar to another spell you already have might also be considered for this option.

So you could choose to gain two new cantrips, or "upgrade" four uncommon-tier spells you already had, or gain one new spell and upgrade two you already had, or some other combination of the above.

Alternatively, instead of choosing two of the above options, you may choose the following option:

* Gain one [[rare-tier|spell tier]] spell.

You can take this talent multiple times to gain access to more spells. Gain access to higher-tier spells by taking the [[Spellcaster 2]] or [[Spellcaster 3]] talents.
