        "text": "The Golden Serpent is the [[celestial]] patron of the order known as [[Miron's Tears]]. He is one of the last true [[couatl]]s in existence; like [[Samyr Kes]], he was left as a guardian when his companions sacrificed themselves to create the [[Silver Flame]]. Although he hasn’t manifested physically in the world for over two hundred years, he provides guidance and advice, and facilitates communication between Samyr Kes and agents in the field. He also monitors the Tears to ensure that active agents aren’t under the influence of the [[Shadow in the Flame|Bel Shalor]]. It is the Golden Serpent who has pushed Samyr Kes down his current path; the Serpent is disgusted by the corruption spreading through the church, and wants to see it destroyed.",
