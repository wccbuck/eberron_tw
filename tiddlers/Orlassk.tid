<div align="right">—A cultist of Orlassk</div>

The [[daelkyr]] Orlassk is the master of stone. Orlassk's traditional
cults say that it is the Still Lord who carves out caverns, and
that it is the Voice in the Stone that guides the miner to the ore.
Orlassk can breathe life into stone, as seen in the [[gargoyle]]; but
it can also turn living creatures into stone, and it's thought that
most creatures with this power—[[medusa]]s, [[gorgon]]s, [[basilisk]]s,
[[cockatrice]]s—are its creations. Cults may associate with such
creatures, but they can also venerate stone itself. Orlassk's
cultists could venerate a sacred stone that whispers when
it's fed fresh blood, or maintain a deep chamber where all
the secret knowledge of the cult is engraved into the walls.

Orlassk is one of the lesser known daelkyr. Its cults are
found where people live around stone, in high mountains and
deep caves. Orlassk's cults often form around those
who work with stone: masons, sculptors, stone [[giant]]s, or even
just people who dwell in stone towers. When the walls start
whispering to you, Orlassk has found you.

Orlassk is thought to have feuds with other daelkyr. Orlassk
and [[Kyrzin]] are fundamentally opposed: solid against liquid,
static against change. Some scholars suggest that Orlassk's
creation of [[medusa]]s and [[basilisk]]s is a blow against [[Belashyrra]],
as seeing these creatures is what triggers their deadly power.

Orlassk's citadel is carved into the body of a gargantuan gargoyle that roams the chasms of [[Khyber]].

!! Adventure Hooks

* All of the statues in a city begin speaking, whispering dangerous secrets. There’s a series of inexplicable murders; could it be the work of statues coming to life? 
* A corrupted cult is drawing in members who are then petrified. Their cult leader says that a terrible cataclysm is about to occur, and only those petrified will survive, and the Still Lord will free them once it passes; could it be true? 
* The rituals of a cult are slowly turning a community and everyone in it into stone. 
* A cult is sculpting statues that then come to life; are they replacing important people with these duplicates, or working on a monster that could destroy the city? 
* The cult’s rituals are drawing [[gargoyle]]s to the city, but for what purpose?
