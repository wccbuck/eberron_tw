Vylae is [[Arien Grimbold]]'s mother. She is an herbalist who is full of joy for life. She lived in [[Pylas Pyrial]] for many years before heading north into [[Breland]], and settling in [[Mistmarsh]] with [[Oarsen Grimbold]]. She sometimes gives advice couched in animal analogies, such as "The wise fox stays well ahead of the hounds," or "Don't startle your prey. On a cloudy day, the mouse doesn't see the hawk's shadow."

Vylae is firmly on the side of the rebels, and aids Arien and anyone else fighting the [[Iron Circle]] in any way she can. She believes that the first blow should fall on the [[bullywug]]s of the <<navAndScrollToHeader "The Reavers of Harkenwold" "Toadwallow Caverns">>. They are unnatural creatures, and by harassing the people of [[Mistmarsh]] and particularly [[Tor's Hold]], they're preventing militia folk from joining the resistance. She says, "We cannot vanquish the Iron Circle if Harkenwold is divided, and we can't unite if Tor's Hold is menaced by the Toadwallow monsters."
