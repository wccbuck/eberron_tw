In 969 YK, while serving as a [[Deneith]] mercenary defending the [[Cyre]]-[[Breland]] border, Lhesh Haruuc united the [[Ghaal'dar]] clans and led a violent uprising that claimed southern [[Cyre]]. The region was officially recognized as the independent nation of [[Darguun]] with the [[Treaty of Thronehold]]. \n\nOver the last 29 years, Haruuc has greatly improved the lives of his people. But today, he is an aging king, and unless he finds a capable successor, the Ghaal'dar chieftains seem certain to turn on one another after his death, leading to the collapse of the nation.",
