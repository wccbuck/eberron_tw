Corius Corralyn d'Sivis is a highly respected barrister of the [[Speakers Guild]]. Though he devotes most of his time to the law, he occasionally sells his services as an advocate, lobbying for clients or negotiating high-stakes legal agreements. When adventurers run afoul of the law, Corius can offer them the chance to put their misdeeds behind them. Alternatively, the barrister could be employed to serve as an intermediary, negotiating missions on behalf of a mysterious patron who prefers to keep her identity secret.
