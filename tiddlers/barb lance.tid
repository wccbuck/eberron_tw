title: barb lance
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This heavy lance has a tip made from fifteen barbs folded into one wickedly sharp point. When the command word is uttered, the barbs snap out of the spear's tip, driving into the flesh of the creature it's embedded in. The spear becomes stuck in the creature and cannot be removed without surgical intervention unless the command word is spoken again.
