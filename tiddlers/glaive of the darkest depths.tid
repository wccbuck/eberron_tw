The //glaive of the darkest depths// is one of the [[destiny arms]]â€”a
mighty weapon of the [[giant]]s forged during the war against the [[quori]]. Created by the powerful giant [[necromancer|necromancy]] Izzdelth, the glaive was forged for the sole purpose of combating the ethereal quori. 

This glaive has a shaft made of an oily black metal with a spiral pattern running up its length. At the head of the glaive, a broad silver blade ends in a wicked point. No matter what the light, the blade flickers with a dull shimmering radiance.

While [[quori]] can no longer physically manifest in the Material Plane, this weapon can still be a powerful boon against the forces of the [[Dreaming Dark]]. Striking an [[Inspired]] with the glaive also strikes the [[quori]] within, and forces all but the most powerful quori to end their possession of the host and return to their body in [[Dal Quor]]. 

In addition, using this weapon to attack other incorporeal creatures, such as [[ghost]]s, grants improved [[impact]] to the attack.
