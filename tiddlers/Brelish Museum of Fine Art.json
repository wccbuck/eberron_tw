It has two\nmain areas of emphasis: art representing the Brelish\nspirit (which primarily means any artwork created\nby a Brelish artist) and antiquities from [[Xen'drik]],\nwhich certain people in the Brelish government\nwould like to view as a colony of Breland. Its Brelish art collection is unequalled, and includes some\nworld-famous works by great masters of antebellum\n[[Galifar]]. Its collection of antiquities is also impressive, though it is small in comparison to that of the\n[[Dezina Museum|Dezina Museum of Antiquities]] at [[Morgrave University]]. ",
