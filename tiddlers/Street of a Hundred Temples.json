Every member of the [[Sovereign Host]] and the\n[[Dark Six]] is represented here, in addition to multiple\ntemples dedicated to both pantheons as a whole. A\nsanctuary of the [[Path of Light]] sees [[gnome]]s meditate\nalongside [[kalashtar]] mentors, and the [[Blood of Vol]] has\na sanguinary where folk peacefully contemplate the\ndivinity within. Shrines to the [[Cults of the Dragon Below]] and to the [[overlord]]s of the [[Age of Demons]] can be found here, though worshipers who take their\nbeliefs too seriously face the wrath of the [[Trust]]. The\ncenterpiece of the street is the Codex Vault, the largest temple to [[Aureon]] in [[Khorvaire]].",
