//“It came over the hill and straight at us. I can’t remember exactly how it looked, only its size, and the gray haze that came with it. We lost Drugor. I hope he died quick. I never saw anything that horrific before, and I don’t expect to ever again.”//

Perhaps a few dragons recall Haze-of-Death’s true name, but he himself forgot it on the Day of [[Mourning]].

Once a [[Chamber]] agent, Haze-of-Death left the organization to throw his lot in with the lesser races of [[Khorvaire]]. The great [[white dragon]] saw potential in humanity
and admired [[Vvaraak]]’s example. He wanted to teach the lesser races and help them achieve greatness, seeing them as worthy individuals in their own right, not merely pawns in the [[Draconic Prophecy]]. The Chamber tried to discourage him,
but Haze-of-Death ignored their entreaties.

During his work for the [[Chamber]], Haze-of-Death had forged a friendship with a [[Cyran|Cyre]] professor. He traveled to Cyre to offer his services as a negotiator and a teacher, hoping to help end the [[Last War]] and usher in a new era of enlightenment.

Perhaps Haze-of-Death’s age and power saved him
from the cataclysm on the Day of [[Mourning]]. Perhaps
it was random chance, or a cruel twist of fate. In any
event, the dragon who clawed his way out of the [[Glowing Chasm]] after the devastation was very different from the one who’d come to [[Cyre]]. The rampant arcane energies
crippled Haze-of-Death, then mutated him, and either
the severity of his injuries or his terrible change drove
him hopelessly mad. He is convinced that enemies lurk
on all sides, waiting for a moment of weakness to steal
his possessions.

Now Haze-of-Death lurks deep within the [[Mournland]], scouting far and wide for treasures to add to his “hoard” and devouring anyone unlucky enough to cross his path.

!! Description

Haze-of-Death’s body, once snow-white, now reflects
the dismal gray that permeates the [[Mournland]]. Many
of his scales have broken off to leave jagged, raw patches
on his hide. Bony growths jut from his joints and his
brow, weighing down his already massive head. Rents in
his wings have healed unevenly, leaving a patchwork of
scar tissue across their span and giving Haze-of-Death a
drunken tilt when he flies.

Worse still, the [[dead-gray mists]] that enclose the [[Mournland]] also surround Haze-of-Death. The horrid vapor seeps from bloodless wounds on his flanks and hisses from his nostrils when he breathes.

!! Lair

On an ordinary battlefield, Haze-of-Death would
undoubtedly make his lair in a cavern of bones. The
weird properties of the [[Mournland]], though, have
instead created a horrific den of dead flesh. Out of
the slick earth of the [[dragon]]’s cavern jut the corpses of
soldiers, most clad in armor and some still clutching
weapons. Torsos hang from the ceiling or protrude from
walls, their limbs dangling to brush against creatures
that move past.

Haze-of-Death's lair is defended by an icy [[living breath weapon|living spell]].
