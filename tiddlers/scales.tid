[[Dragonborn|dragonborn]]. [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]]. [[Kobold|kobold]]s. [[Troglodyte|troglodyte]]s. To the typical [[human]] of [[Q'barra]], they are all the same... derisively referred to as //scales//. Even those who know that dragonborn and
lizardfolk are different species rarely care; at the end of the
day, they are still scales.

Superstitions about the scales are as wild as they are
unfounded. In some of the tales, the scales hunger for
human flesh. In others they consume [[dragonshard]]s to
survive, and this is why they attack [[Tharashk]] miners.
It’s common knowledge that the scales sacrifice their
prisoners; the only question is whether their altars are
dedicated to [[dragon]]s or to [[demon]]s. Everyone knows
that the scales are savages, and that those with metal
tools have traded for them or more likely stolen them
from humans. 

In the wake of the [[Mourning]], the scales are growing restless. Every miner knows a story of a caravan raided or a village razed. Children frighten one another with tales of the obsidian palace in the deep jungle and the army massing there.

For decades, the relationship between settler and
scale has been uneasy but stable. The [[Poison Dusk]]
has remained a constant threat, but a balance was
struck with the [[Cold Sun Federation]], and an elder
of the [[Ka'rhashan]] [[dragonborn]] accompanied King
[[Sebastes|Sebastes ir'Kesslan]] to [[Thronehold]] in [[996 YK|Treaty of Thronehold]]. Now that fragile peace is beginning to snap. Cold Sun [[lizardfolk]] are
raiding [[Tharashk]] mines. The attacks of the Poison Dusk are worse than ever. And there are rumors of scaled armies massing in the jungle—a force that could
wipe the settlers from the land.

What has changed in recent years? Lord [[Khalar|Khalar Velderan]] of
House [[Tharashk]] blames the [[Mourning]], claiming that
the scales have heard of the cataclysm and believe
that the settlers are weak. This is a theme that resonates with the settlers, who are as troubled as any by the devastation of [[Cyre]]. However, Tharashk’s recent
actions have had a greater impact on [[Q'barra]] than
the Mourning has. Over the last decade, Tharashk
has exponentially increased its [[dragonshard]] mining
operations. Khalar believes that the [[lizardfolk]] are savages who have no idea what treasures they possess, and he would like nothing better than to assemble a
force of [[ogre]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[orc]]s to drive the [[Cold Sun|Cold Sun Federation]]
tribes from their lands.

This ignorance is dangerous. The [[lizardfolk]] of the [[Cold Sun Federation]] aren’t superstitious fools; they are battling to protect [[Q'barra]] from an evil older than humanity. Three cultures have played in the history of Q’barra. Three forces threaten the settlers in different ways. Adventurers must understand each if they are to protect the nation from the darkness that lies ahead.
