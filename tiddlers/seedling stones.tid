This handful of small, lumpy pebbles are made from seeds and clay and imbued with [[primal magic]]. When a pebble is thrown to fertile ground, thick vines instantly sprout from the ground, climbing swiftly up the nearest surface. These vines make climbing a surface much easier, and can also be used to [[entangle]] enemies. The vines persist for up to 1 minute.
