Ughothka is a unique [[aberration]] that roams along the [[Blackwater River]] in the [[Vile Marsh]]. It is known to locals as "the Harvester" or "the Sporefeeder." Ughothka is always partially obscured by an oily fog, but appears to stand at least 160 feet tall on three spindle-shaped legs. Against creatures, it has no offensive capabilities aside from [[gas spore]]s it spawns from its gullet. The gas spores descend to the ground and seek out creatures in the vicinity. Creatures who breathe in the cloud emitted by a dead [[gas spore]] may become infected; the [[disease]] kills within a few hours unless cured. The dead left behind by the spores disintegrate quickly in the humid climate, and the Harvester sucks up the nutrients through its tripod.

The Harvester has consumed thousands upon thousands of creatures, who all persist in some way as part of the creature's memory. Any attempt to form a mental link with Ughothka, such as with the [[detect thoughts]] spell, may cause a riptide of information to flow into the character's mind. They are afflicted with [[long-term madness]], and they gain some knowledge from a consumed creature; a [[language]], a skill, or a cluster of memories. This new knowledge fades away after the madness passes.
