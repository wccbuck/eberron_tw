        "text": "[[Eston]] was a center for the creation of [[construct]]s long before the first [[warforged]] was formed. [[Artificers|artificer]] sought to prove themselves by adding their own designs to the outpouring of technology that became known as the Clockwork Menagerie of Eston. The most famous of these is Alaran’s mighty [[gorgon]] [[golem]], both a symbol of House [[Cannith]] and the guardian of its vaults. Lesser works include artificial songbirds, walking armor, a carousel of [[griffon]]s, and more. Despite the name of the menagerie, the [[construct]]s come from a variety of traditions; some are [[alchemical|alchemist]], some [[golem]]s, and others [[clockwork]] constructs. At the time of the [[Mourning]], the enclave was home to ten centuries’ worth of automatons, some purely decorative and others ready for battle.\n\nIn the wake of the [[Mourning]], the Clockwork Menagerie has become a threat. Alaran’s gorgon is still active in the ruins, but it is strangely warped, its breath filled with corrupting power. [[Ikar]] the Black has reported encountering a swarm of metal beetles that consumed armor, but there is no record of anyone having designed such a [[construct]].\n\nBased on reports from those who have entered the area, the creatures of the menagerie are evolving. It remains to be seen if they are working toward some grander purpose, or if these changes are driven simply by the instinct for survival.",
