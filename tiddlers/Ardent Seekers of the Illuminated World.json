        "text": "The Ardent Seekers of the Illuminated World are a knightly order of [[templar]]s of the [[Silver Flame]] based in [[Lathleer]], [[Aundair]]. The order was founded during the [[Silver Crusade]], originally with the name ''The Office of the Hallowed Confessors''. Their stated purpose remains the same through the centuries: to root out evil forces and cleanse the world of them, by all appropriate means; however, the definition of \"appropriate\" has evolved over time. During the [[Silver Crusade]], the Hallowed Confessors were infamous for burning villages of suspected [[therianthrope]]s and torturing their captives. While they have softened their approach and have attempted to repair their reputation over the decades, they are still associated with the [[Pure Flame]] movement, and their members include many uncompromising zealots.",
