        "text": "Often when people refer to the Foundry in [[Stormreach]], they mean\nthe foundry itself and the many forges that cluster on\nthe streets around it, including the [[Stormreach Forge]].\nMore metal is cast in the Foundry than anywhere else in the city, and the neighborhood’s metalworkers, weaponsmiths, and armorsmiths produce excellent\nwork. The bulk of the goods go to the [[Stormreach Guard]] and House [[Deneith]], but the Stormreach Forge also sells weapons to other buyers.\n\nThe Foundry is close to a small dock on the river,\nowned by the [[Omaren family]] and heavily used by House\n[[Deneith]]. It allows small ships to dock and load and\nunload goods. The Foundry requires ore to feed its\nhunger, and this comes from House [[Tharashk]]’s mining\noperations outside the city. A few dockworkers land\nhighly desired jobs unloading ore and ingots. This work\nis handed out by lottery every time a ship comes in.",
