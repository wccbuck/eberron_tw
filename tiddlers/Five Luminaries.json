The first Luminaries were five of the six [[titan]] warriors who defeated and bound Prince [[Adaxus]], an uprising sparked by the Prince's reckless channeling of [[fiend]]ish forces. Each of the Five presided over different pillars of Sulat culture, which mostly revolved around [[arcane|arcane magic]] research:\n\n* ''Life'', which explored the potential of [[magebreeding]] using [[planar|plane]] energies and [[manifest zone]]s\n* ''Worlds'', which cataloged and explored the various [[layer]]s of the [[plane]]s and identified unique flora, fauna, and materials\n* ''Bonds'', which studied and developed methods of summoning and containing planar entities (e.g. [[elemental binding]])\n* ''Creation'', which studied the creation of new materials using powerful [[transmutation]] magic, as well as the production of magic tools, vehicles, and weaponry\n* ''Kin'', which controlled trade, diplomacy, and general administration.",
