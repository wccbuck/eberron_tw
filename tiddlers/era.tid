The present is shaped by the past. The shadow of the [[Last War]]
hangs over [[Khorvaire]], setting the stage for conflicts ahead. But
Khorvaire also bears the marks of struggles far more ancient.
The [[goblin]]s in [[Sharn]]'s slums are descended from the founders
of a mighty empire, and they rightfully feel that [[human]]ity stole
their homeland. The [[purging|Silver Crusade]] of [[therianthrope]]s early in the ninth
century strains relations between humanity and [[shifter]]s. The
Church of the [[Silver Flame]] was founded at the end of the third
century, but it's simply the latest manifestation of a conflict that
began at the dawn of timeâ€”a battle still fought in the shadows
by the [[fiend]]ish [[Lords of Dust]] and the [[dragon]]s of the [[Chamber]].

The history of [[Eberron]] can be split into five eras:

* The [[Dawn of Time|Progenitor Dragons]] (pre-history)
* The [[Age of Demons]] (over 100,000 years ago)
* The [[Age of Giants]] (80,000-40,000 years ago)
* The [[Age of Monsters]] (40,000-5,000 years ago)
* The [[Modern Age]], Age of Humanity, or Dragonmarked Age (5,000 years ago to today)

See [[Khorvaire calendar]] for a summary on timekeeping conventions.
