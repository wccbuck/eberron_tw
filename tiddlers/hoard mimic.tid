Kin to the common [[mimic]], hoard mimics are among the oldest and most cunning of their kind. A hoard mimic’s
massive, amorphous form and shape-shifting prowess allow it to take on the semblance of a vast trove of treasures, not just a single object. Like
smaller mimics, hoard mimics exude adhesive goo to trap prey. They can also vent a fine, caustic mist from their pores that burns and blinds
creatures caught in it.

Hoard mimics are so named because many enter into partnerships with [[dragon]]s, each one serving as a false hoard in a dragon’s lair to draw
unwitting intruders away from the real riches—and into the mimic’s maw. If faced with unexpectedly fierce opposition, though, a hoard mimic might
offer information about the true hoard in exchange for its life.
