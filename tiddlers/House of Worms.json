        "text": "An injured gladiator of the [[Bloodstone Arena]] who can’t afford the services of House [[Jorasco]] can try his luck at the House of Worms in [[Bloodstone]]. The grizzled and ornery [[longtooth]] [[shifter]] who runs the hostel is known as Worms, due to his use of broodworms in treating infected wounds. Although his techniques are disturbing, Worms is a skilled healer. Usually Worms can provide only mundane treatment, but he’s always on the lookout for ritual scrolls, and at any given time he might assist with a healing ritual.",
