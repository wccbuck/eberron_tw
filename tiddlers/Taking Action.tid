!! Overview

As a player in a [[Storyloom]] game, whenever you want your character to do something that has the potential to be dangerous or troublesome, you have to [[roll dice|Dice Roller]] to determine whether you succeed, and to what extent you succeed. You roll a handful of six-sided dice (or "d6"), and read the single highest result.

* If the highest die is a 6, it's a [[full success]]—you accomplish what you set out to do. Typically this means you suffer no [[consequence]]s or gain some additional advantage. If you roll more than one 6, that's a ''critical success''.
* If the highest die is a 4 or 5, that's a [[mixed success]]—you accomplish what you set out to do, but there are [[consequence]]s, such as [[stress]], reduced [[impact]], or a complication.
* If the highest die is a 1, 2, or 3, that's a [[bad outcome]] or failure. Things go poorly. You suffer [[consequence]]s and probably don't accomplish your goal.

You roll ''two dice'' when attempting to directly [[overcome]] an obstacle, or ''three dice'' when attempting to [[boost]] your chances of success. Boosting grants [[momentum]], a resource which you can spend to add dice to your dice pool for an overcome action. For a list of probabilities for each outcome, see [[Storyloom dice probabilities]].

Like [[Blades in the Dark|https://bladesinthedark.com/basics]] and other "Powered by the Apocalypse" games, ''the GM does not roll dice to take actions. Only the players do.'' So enemies, NPCs, and the like only "act" in the sense that their actions and decisions are narrated depending on the results of the players' dice rolls.

''A Note on NPC Game Mechanics''<br/>
Certain spells, items, and magical effects in the game might describe how they restore the target's [[stress]] or [[harm]], or apply [[disadvantage]] to a specific action performed by the target, or in some way interact with PC-specific game mechanics. If any of these effects are applied to non-player characters, the GM needs to adjudicate how to translate them into a player-focused mechanic. Some are easy; disadvantage for an enemy means an [[advantage]] for a PC. Others might need some narrative framing. When in doubt, the GM can just translate bonuses into [[momentum]] or some other positive effect.

Generally speaking, [[Storyloom]] is a game system which assumes the player characters have baseline competence in any action that would sensibly align with their background (as described in their [[aspect]]s and [[talent]]s). A soldier can wield a sword, and a bard can play their instrument; however, neither of these characters necessarily know how to perform surgery. If there is no in-universe justification for a character to be able to overcome a particular obstacle, the GM can set the obstacle at a higher [[challenge tier|Challenge Tiers]], creating a smaller, more manageable goal that must be achieved before the original obstacle can be addressed. (See also the [[Jack-Of-All-Trades]] talent.)

As mentioned previously, typically players will roll two or three dice when making an attempt. But there are many ways to add dice to your pool, including [[advantage]]s and spending [[momentum]]. We'll go over changing the size of the dice pool later (see <<scrollToHeader "Adjusting the Dice Pool">>), but first let's discuss [[impact]] and [[risk]].

!! Impact and Risk

Every attempt you make has an associated [[impact]] (the benefits of success) and [[risk]] (the consequences of failure).

Your attempts' [[impact]] level determines how much you're able to accomplish with a successful roll ([[full success]] or [[mixed success]]). If you're using a [[progress clock]] to track your progress towards a goal, impact helps determine how many segments of the clock to fill in. Impact does not play a part in the event of a [[bad outcome]]. Depending on the context, you may end up with zero [[impact]] even on a success, requiring the spending of [[momentum]] to make any progress.

The [[risk]] associated with an attempt determines how bad the [[consequence]]s are for a [[mixed success]] or [[bad outcome]]. Risk does not play a part in the event of a [[full success]]. These consequences can include taking [[stress]] or losing [[momentum]]. Risk can be low, moderate (default), high, or extreme.

The GM decides how to set the [[impact]] and [[risk]] based on the context of the scene, and by the [[approach]]es chosen by the players (see the <<scrollToHeader "Choosing Approaches">> section below). If a player character is playing it safe for an incremental success, the GM might decide impact is low, risk is low. An action which may turn the tides in a desperate situation might be high impact, high risk. Things like [[talent]]s can also affect [[impact]] and [[risk]], as can [[spell tier]]s and the [[rarity]] of [[magic item]]s. See [[Challenge Tiers]] for more information. 

After the GM sets the impact and risk of an attempt, a player can further adjust impact and risk if they have assigned points to the [[approach]]es they've chosen. See the next section for more information.

!! Choosing Approaches

When a [[Storyloom]] character takes action, they choose two [[approach]]es that describe ''how'' they are handling this challenge. There are six possible options, each of which has an opposite. The six approaches are:

* ''Force'' and ''Savvy''
* ''Flair'' and ''Guile''
* ''Speed'' and ''Caution''

There is only one restriction on which approaches a player character can use: you ''cannot choose two opposite approaches'' for a given attempt. You can try to solve a problem using brute force OR clever savvy, but not both. You can try to go loud (with Flair) or quiet (with Guile), but not both. However, Force and Caution? Speed and Savvy? Fair game. 

For further discussion of what each approach means, and examples of how they might look in play, see the [[approach]] page.

Once you decide which approaches your character is using on a particular action, look at your [[character sheet|character sheet template]] and determine whether your character has any points in those approaches. Add those numbers up; their sum is the amount of points you can use to improve your roll. You can raise your [[impact]] or reduce your [[risk]] (minimum "Low") once for each approach point. You must decide how to use your approach points ''before'' you roll the dice.

Now let's talk about the differences between a [[boost]] and an [[overcome]], the two types of actions one can take in the [[Storyloom]] system.

!! Overcome and Boost

Any attempt you make in Storyloom can be boiled down to one of two actions: [[overcome]] or [[boost]].

* ''Overcome'' an obstacle, tackling a challenge, hindrance, or engaging task. This is the move you make when you are directly attempting to make progress towards a goal, attack an enemy, face immediate danger, or finish a scene. By default, you roll ''two dice'' for an overcome.
* ''Boost'' your chances of success on future [[overcome]] actions by increasing your [[momentum]]. Help an ally, create a situation that helps you succeed, or discover a benefit that already exists. By default, you roll ''three dice'' for a boost.

Whether your character is making a boost or overcome attempt, they still choose two [[approach]]es that describe their action, and [[impact]] and [[risk]] still come into play. A boost is a bit more likely to succeed than an overcome, but it doesn't directly grant progress towards a goal; instead, it grants [[momentum]] that can be used to improve a later overcome attempt.

!!! Losing and Regaining Initiative

You may have noticed that the only two actions in the Storyloom system are both very //active//, and imply that the player character is always in control of their destiny. Of course, that isn't always the case in-fiction. Let's say a hero is in a long hallway, and a dragon sits on one end, preparing to breathe fire. The hero doesn't have time to run towards the creature, and can only dive out of the way or try to block with his shield. Would this attempt be an [[overcome]]? If so, what [[progress clock]] would the player be attempting to advance? He's just reacting, trying to avoid death. Would the attempt be a [[boost]]? If so, why should being in such a vulnerable position allow an extra die and grant [[momentum]] on success? 

Whenever a player character is in a dicey situation where they can't make progress towards their goals and are forced to simply react to threats or defend against attacks, they are considered to have lost [[initiative]]. Without initiative, a player character cannot make [[boost]] actions, and can only make [[overcome]] actions to clear a new [[progress clock]], which typically has two segments. This new progress clock can be labelled "Initiative," or something that directly describes an urgent obstacle that has suddenly arisen; once this clock is cleared, the player character has regained initiative.

So in the above example, the hero has lost [[initiative]], and so we've placed a new progress clock in play labeled "Long Hallway Full of Dragonfire," which he must clear before he can make progress on any other task. His attempt to avoid perishing in dragonfire would be an overcome attempt, and a success on that attempt would fill segments on the "Long Hallway" progress clock; once that clock is filled, he can pursue the "Dragon" obstacle using overcome and boost actions as normal.

!! Adjusting the Dice Pool

When making an attempt, there are four ways to add dice to the pool, rolling more than just two/three six-sided dice (d6) to increase the odds of success: [[advantage]]s, [[momentum]], [[pushing yourself|push yourself]], and [[story point]]s.

* ''Momentum'' is a resource you gain by successfully [[boost]]ing, or occasionally by other means such as overfilling a [[progress clock]]. Each character can gain up to 5 momentum. They can spend a point of momentum ''after'' an [[overcome]] attempt to roll an additional d6, or to add [[impact]] to their successful result. You can't use momentum to improve a [[boost]] attempt, since the purpose of boost is to gain momentum.
* ''Advantage'' is a flat +1 d6 bonus granted to certain specific actions, usually granted by a [[talent]], [[spell]] effect, or [[magic item]]. Rarely, magical effects or other factors can remove one die from your pool; this is sometimes called [[disadvantage]]. ''Note:'' If you ever need to make a roll but you have zero or negative dice due to disadvantages, roll two dice and take the single lowest result.
* ''Push yourself'' to gain 1 [[momentum]] after rolling an attempt, which you immediately use to gain +1 d6 or +1 [[impact]]; however, this requires you to suffer a [[consequence]] (usually 2 [[stress]]). This bonus is limited to once per attempt.
* Spend a ''Story Point'' to gain 3 [[momentum]] after rolling an attempt, which you immediately use to gain any combination of +1 d6 or +1 impact. You must narrate how your character's [[aspect]]s make the use of the story point fit into the story.

!! Action Summary

A player or GM calls for a roll when the player’s character performs a dangerous or troublesome action. The player describes what their character intends to do, and the player and GM decide which two [[approach]]es best describe that action, as well as the [[risk]] and [[impact]] for the roll. The player adjusts the impact and risk for their roll based on how many approach points they have available.

After the [[risk]] and [[impact]] are known, if the player decides to make the attempt, they roll two (for an [[overcome]]) or three (for a [[boost]]) six-sided die, plus any additional dice from [[advantage]]s, and look at their highest result. (If rolling "zero" dice, roll two and pick the lowest.) A 6 is a [[full success]] (two or more 6’s is a critical), a 4-5 is a [[mixed success]], and a 1-3 is a [[bad outcome]]. 

After making the roll, a player has some options for fudging the result. For example, on an [[overcome]], you can spend any [[momentum]] you may have available to add another dice roll or an additional point of [[impact]] to your result. Additionally, you can [[push yourself]] for +1 [[momentum]], or spend a [[story point]] for +3 momentum, to be spent on this attempt only. 

The GM narrates what happens based on your result, advancing [[progress clock]]s or doling out [[consequence]]s as necessary, and the scene continues!
