Tradefair Market, the open-air marketplace, operates daily during daylight
hours. In contrast to other marketplaces in the city of [[Sharn]],
Tradefair has regulations about stall spacing that
ensure relatively straight, wide, and open (though
crowded) aisles for customers to walk through. The
goods available in Tradefair are generally of high
quality, and an abundant number of House [[Cannith]] tinkers can be found to make repairs through mundane or magical means. A permit to sell in
Tradefair Market for one day costs [[0.5c|money]], which certainly guarantees a certain level of quality among the merchants present, and keeps the market from
becoming overcrowded.
