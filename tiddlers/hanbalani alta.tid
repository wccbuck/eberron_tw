The massive monoliths of [[Riedra]] serve many purposes.
They draw on the emotions of the nearby populace and
transform these thoughts into psychic energy, which is
used to power many systems in nearby communities. More
importantly, they allow the [[quori]] to shape the dreams of
masses of humans, and in so doing, to prevent change in
[[Dal Quor]]. Most importantly, the hanbalani are slowly bringing [[Dal Quor]] into alignment with [[Eberron]], repairing the damage inflicted by the [[giant]]s [[ages ago|Age of Giants]]. Already, the [[quori]] are able to possess willing humans. As more monoliths are built, quori might be able to possess other willing creatures, and [[manifest zone]]s tied to [[Dal Quor]] could appear across the world. Eventually, the quori should be able to
physically manifest on [[Eberron]].

Along with the functions detailed in the Monolith Features section below, these are the known functions of the hanbalani, but they could just be the beginning. The
monoliths might be physically transforming Eberron
into a replica of [[Dal Quor]] or granting [[quori]] the ability
to rapidly regenerate their [[psionic|psionics]] power.

''Getting the PCs Involved:'' The [[Arcane Congress]]
and the [[Twelve]] know of the hanbalani, but they have little
idea what these massive structures do. Explorers might
be sent to study a monolith, to try determine what its
purpose is. Once this information is known, PCs might
find that shutting down a monolith is a vital step in any
sort of plan involving a [[Riedra]]n city. Alternatively, PCs
could join a group of [[Akiak]] or [[kalashtar]] commandos on
a mission to destroy as many hanbalani as possible.

!! Monolith Features

!!! Shell

Monoliths vary in size and shape, but they are usually
egg-like, approximately 300 feet tall and 100 feet wide.
When hanbalani are in close proximity to one another,
such as within a major bastion, they tend to be smaller.
They are constructed of psionically reinforced steel and
[[crysteel]]. A monolith shell has apertures at the base, and
these doorways are up to 15 feet wide.

The "floor" of a monolith is open to the terrain on
which it's built. Inside, a monolith is cavernous. It has
no features aside from the interior wall, the core, and a
small aperture at the top that leads to the controls.

The shape and reflective interior of a monolith,
as well as the design, the crystal core, and the control
crystals, link each hanbalan to [[Dal Quor]]. Beings on Dal
Quor can contact a particular monolith from a specific
corresponding area in a [[quori]] enclave on Dal Quor. Doing so
works the same as accessing a monolith from the control
crystals on Eberron.

Monolith shells are designed to contain the blast of
a detonating core. The shell's two inner and outer layers
have 3 feet of space between them. Each layer is nearly 2
feet thick, and nearly as hard as [[adamantine]].

!!! Core

A 10-foot-diameter pillar of pure crystal, the core of an
active monolith is warm to the touch. Its greenish light
illuminates the entire interior of the shell and creates
shadowy illumination within 300 feet of the apertures.

A monolith core acts as a giant [[cognizance crystal]], storing a great deal of [[psionic|psionics]] energy that can used by any psionic creature touching it. If expended, the energy slowly replenishes over 12-24 hours. This reserve is accessible from Dal Quor, so a monolith usually has <<dr "2d8">> hours of psionic energy at any given time.

Many monoliths enhance psionics used within 600 feet of them. Some are even more powerful, and can increase the area of their effect up to many miles.

Specific monoliths are often tied to powering other functions used to maintain order and provide comfort in [[Riedra]]. These include [[dreamshaping]], the [[Soothing Voice]], [[climate control|Riedran climate control]], [[crystal illumination]], and [[scry shielding|psionic scry shielding]]. In these cases, the psionic empowering effect is suppressed unless the core's function is changed (see Controls below). 

If a monolith's core is broken or shut down, the monolith and all its subsidiary utilities cease functioning. When a core is improperly tampered with, it can explode. It
might also explode 10-60 seconds after it suffers heavy damage. Creatures
outside the shell and not near an aperture are unharmed.

Shutting down or destroying a monolith core
immediately alerts any [[quori]] tapped into the monolith
from [[Dal Quor]]. Otherwise, the authorities are notified within a few minutes (or longer if the area is not heavily settled).

!!! Controls

At the top of a monolith's interior, a cluster of small crystals
and Siberys [[dragonshard]]s pulse and glow with multiple
colors, regulating the power of the monolith core. Here,
the monolith's functions can be altered and accessed.

A creature that possesses [[psionics]] can attempt to
manipulate a monolith's functioning. By touching the control crystals and making a successful attempt representing 1 minute of effort, the creature bonds with the monolith's control crystals. Failing the attempt causes the monolith to store the user's identity and description (mental picture), giving that information to
any [[Inspired]] or [[quori]] who contact the monolith within the
next few hours. Once a bond with the control crystals has
been established, additional attempts can alter the
monolith's function:

* ''Easy''
** Lure psionic creatures to the monolith.
** Activate dormant monolith safely.
* ''Moderate''
** Shut down active monolith safely.
** Sever connection to public utilities.
** Recharge the core's psionic reserve.
* ''Difficult''
** Sever connection to [[Dal Quor]].
** Set the core to explode in 10 minutes.
** Shut down a self-destruct sequence.

A user can attempt to perform the action in half the time, but at a higher [[risk]]. A failure might mean that contact with the controls has been disrupted and must be reestablished. A high-risk failure when controlling the monolith sends the monolith into a psionic feedback loop, negating all further attempts at control and causing the monolith's core to explode in 10-60 seconds.

In any case, a monolith's secondary functions
require power. Powering utilities with a monolith
requires it to be at full psionic reserve. While a
monolith is performing a secondary function, its power
can't be redirected or siphoned, so a saboteur must disconnect a monolith to siphon off its power. Then the monolith can't be reconnected to the utility until it
has fully recharged.

!! Special Situations

Here are a couple of special situations involving monoliths.

!!! Creatures

Because the core of a monolith radiates light and heat, as well as psionic power, a monolith built in a remote location attracts psionic creatures from
miles around. Tribes that travel on foot in [[Syrkarn]] and
the [[Tashana Tundra]] sometimes use monoliths as shelter.
Normal creatures living within a mile of a monolith can
have phrenic or psionically gifted offspring, but such
an occurrence is extremely unusual and more so if the
monolith is used to power a subsidiary function. If a
remote monolith ceases working, [[Inspired]] agents come
and wipe out any creatures in the vicinity, so inhabitants
are likely to oppose intruders looking to harm a wilderness monolith.

As indicated in the "Controls" section above, a character can use the controls to lure psionic creatures to a monolith. This call has a range of 1 mile, but it is not
a compulsionâ€”non-sapient creatures usually respond, but cleverer creatures can choose not to. This tool is often useful to the [[Inspired]] or [[quori]]. If the call is not expected or
planned, they send troops to investigate. 

!!! Under Construction

If a monolith is still under construction, it has as many as three hundred workers
living in and around it, plus a squad of twenty Riedran soldiers (usually [[Stone|Stone Soldiers]]) led by a sergeant. After a
monolith is activated, the soldiers and a trained engineer remain stationed there for up to a week.

The interior of an uncompleted monolith is filled
with wooden scaffolding that rises up to 400 feet off the
ground. Workers use this scaffolding to hoist sections
of the shell into position during the building process.
