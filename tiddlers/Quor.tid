Quor is the [[language]] of the [[quori]] of [[Dal Quor]]. It is commonly spoken by [[kalashtar]] and [[Inspired]], though it is a hissing, guttural tongue more suited to the alien forms of the quori than their [[humanoid]] hosts. It has its own
written form, a flowing, elegant script with many circular letters.

Quor heavily influenced the mortal languages of [[Riedran]] and [[Adaran]].
