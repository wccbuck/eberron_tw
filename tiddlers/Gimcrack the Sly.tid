title: Gimcrack the Sly
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Gimcrack thought to make a small fortune smuggling luxuries into [[Stormreach]] from [[Khorvaire]] for the expatriates in the city. It was a sound plan, but
he fell afoul of [[Berrigan Enge]]. By the time Berrigan was done taxing him, he didnâ€™t have enough gold left to buy passage home, let alone to invest in exotic items to take back to double his money. All but destitute and reduced to working on the docks, Gimcrack drowns his sorrows in the [[Wavecrest Tavern]] and dreams of working for, and joining, the [[Storm Lords]].
