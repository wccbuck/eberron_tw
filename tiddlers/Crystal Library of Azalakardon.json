[[Divination|divination]] has produced no results, but it's well known that his private sanctum is shielded with magics of the highest tier. Many say that his sanctum includes thousands of [[spellshard]] journals—the greatest collection of information on the Prophecy ever assembled, including the secret that drove him mad. By now Azalakardon must be dead of old age, but his library has never been found. What traps guard this trove of knowledge?",
