title: Riedra Embassy (Sharn)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

After a thousand years of silence and secrecy, the
[[Inspired]] have emerged from the shadows of
[[Sarlona]]. [[Riedra]] itself remains a mystery; visitors are not welcome in the land of the Inspired. But the ambassadors of Riedra can be found in all of the
courts of [[Khorvaire]]. They are charming and urbane,
generous with gifts and eager to help the nations of
Khorvaire recover from the physical and psychological damage of the [[Last War]]. Most are happy to receive the assistance of the Riedrans. But there are some who wonder about the true motives of the Inspiredâ€”some who suspect that the lords of the silent empire
are preparing to expand their dominion. 

Ambassador [[Jorasesh]] is the [[Inspired]] diplomat who manages the embassy. Most of the other members of the embassy staff are
[[human]]s from Riedra. Chosen for their complete
loyalty to the Inspired, these people rarely speak
to outsiders; many do not even understand the
[[Common]] tongue. In addition to scribes, servants,
and soldiers, the embassy staff includes the following
special operatives:

* [[Maleshari]]
* [[Helkashtai]]
* [[Minharkhad]]
