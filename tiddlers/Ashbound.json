They believe that nature and\ncivilization are at war, and they are the champions of the wild. Ashbound [[druid]]s seek to\ndefend the natural world from the depredations\nof civilization and see [[arcane magic]] as a\ndangerous and corrupting force. In frontier\nregions, the Ashbound launch guerilla strikes\nagainst encroaching settlements and make brutal\nexamples of poachers. Ambitious Ashbound even\nattack the holdings of [[dragonmarked house]]s and\nrelease bound [[elemental]]s in their service.\n\nCompared to the [[Wardens of the Wood]], the Ashbound are a tiny sect, claiming no more than four thousand members (primarily [[human]]s and [[shifter]]s.) The charismatic head of the Ashbound is [[Gharull]].",
