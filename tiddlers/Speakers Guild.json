It also oversees\na number of professions tied to the spoken word.\nThe guild trains and licenses barristers, mediators,\nheralds, interpreters, and other similar professions.\nAlthough some of these services overlap with those of\nHouse [[Phiarlan]], as a rule the Speakers Guild handles\npractical matters of communication, while House\nPhiarlan focuses on artistic endeavors.\n\nOperators of [[speaking stone]]s often use a condensed language called Stonespeech which was designed by the [[gnome]]s of [[Tasker's Dream]]. It is a difficult language to master; however, when someone who knows Stonespeech uses [[sending]] or any other power or ritual that carries a limited word count, they can triple the length of the message by using Stonespeech to communicate it. (The recipient of the message must also know Stonespeech for the communication to succeed.) The language is a trade\nsecret of House [[Sivis]], and it would be quite unusual for\nan outsider to know it.",
