It also oversees\na number of professions tied to the spoken word.\nThe guild trains and licenses barristers, mediators,\nheralds, interpreters, and other similar professions.\nAlthough some of these services overlap with those of\nHouse [[Phiarlan]], as a rule the Speakers Guild handles\npractical matters of communication, while House\nPhiarlan focuses on artistic endeavors.\n\nOperators of [[speaking stone]]s often use a condensed language called [[Stonespeech]] which was designed by the [[gnome]]s of [[Tasker's Dream]]. It is a difficult language to master; however, when someone who knows Stonespeech uses [[sending]] or any other spell that carries a limited word count, they can triple the length of the message by using Stonespeech to communicate it.",
