Escalating trade has brought bustling commerce and
growth in the unlikeliest of places—the wild and rugged
coastline of the [[Tashana Tundra]]. The port communities
of Whitetooth and [[Winterstead]] are two of the strangest settlements in all of [[Eberron]], a mix of [[shifter]] and [[maenad]], with pirates, smugglers, and other unsavory elements from [[Khorvaire]] added to the mix.

Whitetooth, at the mouth of the [[Tiiki River]], has
been a permanent [[shifter]] village for time out of mind.
The tribes have long held the spot communally as a
place to facilitate trade from the coast and inward along
the river. When [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] sea merchants discovered the
medicinal and magical properties of the various [[Tashana lichens|Tashana lichen paste]]—especially the potent [[icewild]]—intercontinental
trade found a new foothold on the continent of [[Sarlona]].
In recent years, a small but very lucrative demand for
authentic [[shifter art|Culture of the Tashana shifters]] has opened new avenues of commerce for the elite treasure hunter.

Merchants in both
Whitetooth and [[Winterstead]] are actively recruiting for
help in acquiring and transporting Tashanan lichen
harvests. Some expeditions are simply looking for protection as they move inland to barter with the shifter
tribes. Others might be looking for a small team to make
contact with remote tribes and discover new sources and
suppliers. High-end art dealers are also operating in
both settlements, paying handsomely for any authentic
shifter art that can be acquired—no questions asked.
