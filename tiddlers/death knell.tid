This dark metal halberd is grimly ornate. When you kill a hostile creature with this weapon, a foreboding gong sound emanates from the blade. Hostile creatures within 15 feet of the target that have suffered any injuries experience a chilling fear of the grave. If they cannot resist, they suffer some psychic damage and may flee in fright.
