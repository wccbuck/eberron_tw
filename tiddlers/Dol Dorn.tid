Dol Dorn is the Sovereign of Strength and Steel. He is the patron of the common soldier, and he guides the hands of anyone who holds a weapon. He embodies courage, strength, duty, and martial skill. He is also the deity of honorable competition and sport. 

Dol Dorn despises those who shed blood in the name of cruelty or greed, or who glory in mindless violence. He protects warriors forced into battle under an unjust cause, but he also protects deserters who refuse to carry out unjust commands.

His commands are simple but strong:

* Shirk your duty only if your charges have become unworthy of it.
* Achieve and maintain physical perfection.
* Test your physical powers in contests and in battle. May the strongest prevail!

According to the [[Pyrinean Creed]], Dol Dorn is the brother of [[Dol Arrah]] and the [[Mockery]]. 

!! {{!!title}} in Other Traditions

Dol Dorn is held in high honor by the [[Three Faces of War]] sect, alongside [[Dol Arrah]] and the [[Mockery]].

The monastic Order of the [[Broken Blade]] honors Dol Dorn above all other Sovereigns, believing that he teaches them directly when they engage in worthy struggles.

The talespinners of Doldarunhold in the [[Mror Holds]] swear that the hero [[Doldarun]] was the son of Dol Dorn and [[Dol Arrah]].

In the [[Rushem√©]] faith of the [[giant]]s, aspects of Dol Dorn and [[Balinor]] are combined in the deity known as "Banor, the Bloody Spear."

In the [[dragon]] faith known as [[Thir]], Dol Dorn was once a mighty [[silver dragon]] named //Duldonak//. Together with two other draconic champions, //[[Dularanahk|Dol Arrah]]// and //[[Dulazurak|Mockery]]//, he faced off against the [[overlord]] [[Katashka]], the Gatekeeper. (See [[Orb of Dol Azur]] for more information.) Those dragons who wish to embody the [[Sovereign archetype]] of Dol Dorn are known as [[wyrms of war|wyrm of war]].
