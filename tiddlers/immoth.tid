Immoths are solitary [[elemental]] creatures native to the [[plane]] of [[Risia]]. They resemble gleaming, 8-foot-tall humanoids carved from dense, translucent ice. An immoth's face is [[dwarf]]-like and typically bearded with icicles, but it also has icy talons and a long, crystalline tail. As manifestations of the "Killing Cold," the malign entity at the core of Risia, immoths possess an innate desire to feed on the warmth and life essence of living creatures. They also have a hunger for knowledge of all kinds, and they can steal thoughts and memories from the minds of living creatures they touch. They do not speak to outsiders, but can understand [[Primordial]] and possibly other [[language]]s.

Like other spirits of ice, immoths only physically manifest when they are compelled to, and until then are content to sit in formless silence for centuries.
