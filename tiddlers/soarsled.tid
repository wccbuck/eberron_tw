A soarsled is a 3-foot-diameter crystalline disk crackling with energy, 5 feet in diameter, that flies with greet speed and maneuverability through the air. Within the city of [[Sharn]] or another [[Syrania]]n [[manifest zone]], a character can fly a soarsled at a speed of up to 20 mph, controlling its movements with their mind. The soarsled can carry up to 400 lbs, and stops hovering when the rider steps off it.

Outside a Syranian manifest zone, the soarsled's maximum speed is reduced to around 10 mph and the sled can only be used a few minutes until it spends at least 8 hours in a Syranian manifest zone.
