Whitehearth was an enormous [[Cannith]] [[forgehold]] in [[Cyre]], most famous for being the first facility which produced [[warforged]], starting in 965 YK. Whitehearth is presumed destroyed following the [[Mourning]]; the director, [[Halea d'Cannith]], and all staff on site at the time of the [[Mourning]] are presumed dead. 

Thirty miles inside the [[Mournland]], 100 miles south of the Saerun Road, is a mineshaft into a low hill. The only sign on the entrance is a [[Cannith]] seal, marking the secret facility below as that house’s property. Although Whitehearth was well known during and before the war as an ancestral Cannith forgehold and weapon research laboratory, few know what wonders and horrors this place holds. One of the lead researchers of the facility, a one-armed [[artificer]] named ''Kharizal d'Cannith'', was rumored to have been involved in experiments involving mind control and the merging of flesh and metal.

[[Merrix d'Cannith]] of [[Sharn]] has information
indicating that Whitehearth’s [[artificer]]s enjoyed a
breakthrough just before the [[Mourning]]. He has dispatched teams to locate Whitehearth and recover its contents. So far, none have returned.
