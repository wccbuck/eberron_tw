Duralt the Augur is a noble personality in [[Stormreach]]; he came with the first wave of settlers from [[Aundair]], and is considered to be the heart of [[Whitewash]]. In his youth, he sold his services as an [[augur|magewright]] in the [[Marketplace]]. These days he stays in Whitewash, living off his savings and donations from those who come to him for advice. He might perform an [[augury]] for anyone he takes a liking to, but his strong common sense can be just as useful as his mystical talents.
