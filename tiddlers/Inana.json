        "text": "What little is known of the Inana\n[[maenad]]s suggests that they maintain a radically simple,\nalmost deliberately primitive society in the remote [[Tashyvar Islands]]. Separate and distinct coastal villages are designed\nto be entirely self-sufficient, and there is no indication of\nany centralized government. Inana colonists have in recent\ngenerations established a series of fishing villages on the\nwestern seaboard of Tashana, as well as the port community\nof [[Winterstead]], trading peaceably with the native [[Saartuk]]\n[[shifter]] tribes. As a people, the Inana apparently follow some\nkind of seasonal rhythm, with active periods of exploration\nand colonization in the summer, offset by almost hibernation-like episodes in the long dark of winter. In fact,\nvisitors to Inanan villages in the dead of winter report\nentire colonies seemingly abandoned. ",
