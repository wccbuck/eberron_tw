title: Detention
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This tavern in [[Sharn]]'s [[University District]] celebrates its
reputation as a watering hole for the worst
students in [[Morgrave|Morgrave University]]. There’s always an exotic
drinking game or a lively debate on the current
state of the [[Race of Eight Winds]]. Detention is
run by a [[halfling]] who calls herself ''Brandy''. She
claims to be a excoriate, driven from House
[[Ghallanda]] after refusing to water down her ale,
but some say she’s the [[Ghallanda patriarch|Yoren d'Ghallanda]]’s heir. The [[warforged]] bouncer ''Bumper'' keeps the
rowdiest students under control.
