The fortress of Turakbar's Fist in [[Droaam]] is set upon an imposing mound of volcanic rock in the center of a sprawling plain. The [[minotaur]] [[warlord]] [[Rhesh Turakbar]] and his [[demon]]-worshiping clan rule here, the fortressâ€™s outer walls painted with the blood of their foes as a grim warning.
