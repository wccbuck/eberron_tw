title: wind fan
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While holding this fan, you can wave it to create a powerful gust of wind. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has an increasing chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.
