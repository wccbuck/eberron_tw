Each [[magic item]] (and some "mundane" items) has a rarity: ''common'', ''uncommon'', ''rare'', ''very rare'', or ''legendary''. Common magic items, such as a [[potion of healing]], are the most plentiful. Most legendary items, such as the [[breastplate of Kamvuul Norek]], are unique. The secrets of creating the most powerful items arose in past [[era]]s and then were gradually lost as a result of wars, cataclysms, and mishaps. (See also [[random artifact properties]])

Rarity provides a rough measure of an item's power relative to other items. Use the below guide to estimate the [[cost|money]] of a magic item of a given rarity. Rarity also provides a guideline for how [[impact]]ful it is when used. If you've got an uncommon weapon and your opponent has common armor, you'll probably have improved impact, all else equal.

A rarity of "â€”" indicates an item whose value is either irrelevant or is heavily contingent on quantity or context.

Approximate [[monetary values|money]] of different item rarities are as follows. For expendable items such as potions, the prices listed below indicate 2-5x the price of an individual item.

* ''Common'': worth 1-10c
* ''Uncommon'': worth 11-50c
* ''Rare'': worth 51-500c
* ''Very Rare'': worth 501-5000c
* ''Legendary'': worth 5001+c
