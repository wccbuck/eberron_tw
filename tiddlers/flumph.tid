The mysterious flumphs drift through the air, propelled through the air by the jets whose sound gives them their name. A flumph glows faintly, reflecting its moods in its color. Soft pink might mean it is amused, deep blue is sadness, green expresses curiosity, and crimson is anger. Flumphs are also sensitive to the emotional states of nearby creatures, and can communicate with conscious in a unique telepathy which involves making patterns emotional impressions.

Flumphs are native to [[Xoriat]]. They feed by siphoning mental energy from [[psionic|psionics]] creatures, a process which is usually painless and even unnoticeable to the host. When threatened, a flumph can spray a cone of foul-smelling liquid.
