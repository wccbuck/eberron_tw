type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The mysterious flumphs drift through the air, propelled through the air by the jets whose sound gives them their name. A flumph glows faintly, reflecting its moods in its color. Soft pink might mean it is amused, deep blue is sadness, green expresses curiosity, and crimson is anger. Flumphs are also sensitive to the emotional states of nearby creatures, and can communicate with conscious in a unique telepathy which involves making patterns emotional impressions. 

Flumphs feed by siphoning mental energy from [[psionic|psionics]] creatures, a process which is usually painless and even unnoticeable to the host. This ability allows them to eavesdrop on telepathic communication in their vicinity, an ability enhanced by the fact that flumphs themselves cannot be perceived by telepathy or [[divination]]. They dislike holding on to malevolent or hostile thoughts, and will therefore try and share such thoughts with good people when they overhear them. When threatened, a flumph can spray a cone of foul-smelling liquid, but are otherwise harmless.

Flumphs are native to [[Xoriat]], where they dwell in a [[layer]] sages have playfully named "''the Emocean''". They drift in harmonious units called cloisters along streams of consciousness, drawing sustenance from the pure psychic emanations surrounding them. This is a blissful experience, and most flumphs have no interest in traveling to the Material Plane. But occasionally, [[manifest zone]]s form maelstroms within the Emocean which can pull these small [[aberration]]s into [[Eberron]], especially when people within the manifest zone suffer intense emotions. Flumphs in the Material Plane are as fish out of water, and need to quickly find a source of psychic emanations in order to survive. While flumphs can draw sustenance from any form of telepathic emanation, they are benevolent by nature. They can survive on a diet of cruelty, but it causes them great distress, and they will seek to expunge the evil thoughts in a psychic exchange with other creatures whenever possible.

As denizens of [[Xoriat]], flumphs perceive reality in very different ways from creatures of the Material Plane, and have different outlooks on the nature of time, space, matter, and individual identity. Those who can bend their brains to encompass these concepts can learn a great deal from flumphs, as shown by the nascent group mind of the [[Uul'gaanu]] and the [[thoughtsinging|thoughtsong]] techniques of the [[Narathun]]. However, these concepts can be difficult to reconcile with everyday life in the Material Plane, and this can make conversations with flumphs confusing for people fully grounded in reality.

!! Flumphs in Eberron

* Flumphs are scattered across [[Sol Udar|Realm Below]] beneath the [[Mror Holds]], pulled in by the fear and suffering of the [[dwarves|dwarf]] battling [[Dyrrn]] the Corruptor. Most Mror flumphs are isolated and lost, struggling to survive. However, sages of [[clan|Mror clan]] [[Narathun]] have established a flumph sanctuary beneath [[Shadowspire]], and have reunited a cloister. A group of [[Narathun]] [[bard]]s have been working with these flumphs to develop their [[thoughtsinging|thoughtsong]] techniques. The flumphs also willingly serve as sentinels, helping Narathun watch for Dyrrn’s forces.
* Flumphs can be found in the swamps of the [[Shadow Marches]]. Some linger in the periphery of dangerous telepathic entities. Others have formed a symbiotic relationship with a sect known as the [[Uul'gaanu]], the “Daughters of the Dream.” 
* Flumphs have emerged in [[wild zone]]s of [[Sarlona]] over the years. Because of their ability to eavesdrop on psychic communication, the [[Inspired]] consider them a security risk and exterminate them whenever they are found. However, a number of flumphs have found safe havens in the fortress monasteries of [[Adar]]. Adaran flumphs are valued members of their communities, engaging in [[thoughtsinging|thoughtsong]] and presenting young [[Adarans]] with philosophical challenges. Some flumphs choose to work with Adaran security forces, watching for [[Inspired]] infiltrators and influences.
