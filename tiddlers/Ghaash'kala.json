        "text": "The Ghaash'kala (a name that roughly translates as \"ghost guardians\") [[orc]] tribes dwell in the [[Labyrinth]] of the [[Demon Wastes]], and believe they have a sacred duty to prevent evil from escaping that blasted land. They act to keep travelers from entering the Wastes, and consider anything that emerges from the Wastes (including barbarians of the [[Carrion Tribes]] or even travelers returning from an expedition) to be hopelessly tainted, and they strike against such creatures without warning or mercy.\n\nAs far as the Ghaash'kala are concerned, the world is divided into two sides: the living and the //fel// (a word that could be translated both as “unliving” or “unnatural”; it is a term that encompasses [[undead]], [[fiend]]s, and life that has been corrupted).\n\nThe Ghaash'kala worship an entity they call Kalok Shash, the \"Binding Flame.\" This is the same ancient divine force that channelers of the [[Silver Flame]] have access to, but the traditions are entirely separate; their faith predates [[human]] civilization itself. Kalok Shash is a harsh faith that requires all able-bodied folk to fight in the endless war against the forces of darkness. Under Kalok Shash, there are only a few recognized positions among the faithful:\n\n* A //korta// (\"speaker\") is someone who hears the voice of the Binding Flame, and serves as a spiritual guide, diplomat, and/or healer. A //korta'sha// can channel [[divine magic]]. Note that the \"voice\" they hear in the Binding Flame is not the same as the Church of the [[Silver Flame]]'s [[Voice of the Flame|Tira Miron]]; the Ghaash'kala have their own voice, an [[orc]] from long ago simply known as \"Korta'Shash\".\n* A //kala// (\"guardian\") is a warrior who fights in service to the Flame. This is the bulk of the Ghaash'kala population. A //kala'sha// is a divine warrior—typically a [[paladin]]. Kala'sha often tattoo a [[couatl]] winding around one of their arms.\n* A //drok// (\"hand\") is a non-combatant, either because of infirmity or because of a vital non-combat skill needed to support the fight.\n\nThe four clans of the Ghaash'kala are: \n\n* the ''Jaasakah''\n* the ''Kastar''\n* the [[Maruk]]\n* the ''Vanka''\n\nThe clans consist of mostly orcs, but [[half-orc]]s, [[human]]s, and even a few [[tiefling]]s can be found among their numbers. They hunt food and gather supplies by entering the many passages to [[Khyber]] scattered throughout the [[Labyrinth]] and harvesting the resources within—not simply physical caverns and underground lakes, but also [[demiplane]]s. The [[Maruk]] hunt balewolves in the [[Abyssal Forest of Khaar]], and wield weapons taken from [[demon]] foot soldiers of the [[Ironlands]]. These strange realms are alien and deadly, but over the many centuries the Ghaash’kala have learned their secrets. As a result, the tribes have resources that can’t be found anywhere in [[Khorvaire]].\n\nThe Ghaash'kala risk their lives every day to\nprotect all mortals from the evils of the Wastes. They typically\nconsider the people of “the south”—meaning everywhere\nsouth of the Demon Wastes—to be weak and naive, but still\nsee it as their duty to protect these innocents from evil. They\ndon't care that they receive no acknowledgment for their\neternal vigilance; it is a war that must be fought.",
