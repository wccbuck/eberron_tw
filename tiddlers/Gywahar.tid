Gywahar is a [[treant]] awakened by the Great Druid [[Oalian]] centuries ago. While Oalian doesn't leave the [[Greenheart]], Gywahar was part of the [[Wardens of the Wood]] forces during the secession of the [[Eldeen Reaches]] fifty years ago, and spoke on behalf of the Great Druid; in fact, many [[Aundair]]ians assumed the treant was Oalian themself.
