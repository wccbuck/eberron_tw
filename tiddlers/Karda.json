{"created": "20210323235205302", "text": "For all that it can be seen as a center for trade, [[Graywall]] is a military outpost on the border of [[Droaam]] and [[Breland]], and the Karda ([[Goblin]] for \"Throne\") is the fortress at the heart of the town. High, thick walls surround\nthe district. Foot soldiers patrol the streets, and\n[[harpies|harpy]] and [[gargoyle]]s circle overhead. The gates\nare open, but the [[minotaur]] sentries question any\nwho wish to enter, demanding to know the business\nthat takes them to the Karda. Foreigners are treated\nwith suspicion and might be questioned by patrols.\n\nThe Karda is the home of the [[Flayer Guard]] and the [[Znir Pact]] barracks. [[Orc|orc]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[minotaur]]s, and [[gnoll]]s make up the bulk of the population, while the troop of war [[troll]]s form an impressive (if small) segment of it. Aside from the soldiers, [[goblin]]s and [[orc]]s can be seen performing menial tasks and civilian jobs. Foreigners are not welcome here, and few [[human]]s or other easterners are visible.\n\n!! Noteworthy Locations\n\nNo businesses are in the Karda. There is a [[grist]]\nmill for the soldiers, but no public amenities. It is a\nfortress, with barracks for the [[Flayer Guard]] and [[Znir Pact]] mercenaries, armories, and other facilities needed to hold the citadel in the face of a siege.\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[location]sort[title]]\">>\n\n!! Adventure Hooks\n\n* The PCs are hired to rescue a petrified victim (possibly a friend, or a spy from their nation who has learned vital information) from the courtyard of the Karda. They have to identify the target among the stone menagerie and then either remove the statue from the Karda or perform the [[restoration]] in the district\u2014all beneath the watchful eye of [[Xorchylic]] and its [[Flayer Guard]]!", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "title": "Karda", "tags": "district Graywall fortress", "modified": "20210827214137607", "style": "{\"color\":\"#6B001B\",\"fillColor\":\"#8E0024\",\"fillOpacity\":0.3}", "polygons": "33.54,-28.916 33.543,-28.926 33.531,-28.914 33.521,-28.907 33.509,-28.909 33.5,-28.923 33.496,-28.942 33.486,-28.927 33.479,-28.919 33.463,-28.919 33.474,-28.906 33.481,-28.895 33.48,-28.883 33.473,-28.864 33.459,-28.848 33.475,-28.855 33.486,-28.855 33.486,-28.847 33.483,-28.833 33.492,-28.842 33.503,-28.847 33.517,-28.847 33.528,-28.836 33.529,-28.857 33.538,-28.867 33.558,-28.874 33.545,-28.882 33.538,-28.894 33.536,-28.906", "color": "#96CC39", "category": "location", "article": "the "}
