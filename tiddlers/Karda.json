        "text": "For all that it can be seen as a center for trade, [[Graywall]] is a military outpost on the border of [[Droaam]] and [[Breland]], and the Karda ([[Goblin]] for \"Throne\") is the fortress at the heart of the town. High, thick walls surround\nthe district. Foot soldiers patrol the streets, and\n[[harpies|harpy]] and [[gargoyle]]s circle overhead. The gates\nare open, but the [[minotaur]] sentries question any\nwho wish to enter, demanding to know the business\nthat takes them to the Karda. Foreigners are treated\nwith suspicion and might be questioned by patrols.\n\nThe Karda is the home of the [[Flayer Guard]] and the [[Znir Pact]] barracks. [[Orc|orc]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[minotaur]]s, and [[gnoll]]s make up the bulk of the population, while the troop of war [[troll]]s form an impressive (if small) segment of it. Aside from the soldiers, [[goblin]]s and [[orc]]s can be seen performing menial tasks and civilian jobs. Foreigners are not welcome here, and few [[human]]s or other easterners are visible.\n\n!! Noteworthy Locations\n\nNo businesses are in the Karda. There is a [[grist]]\nmill for the soldiers, but no public amenities. It is a\nfortress, with barracks for the [[Flayer Guard]] and [[Znir Pact]] mercenaries, armories, and other facilities needed to hold the citadel in the face of a siege.\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[location]sort[title]]\">>\n\n!! Adventure Hooks\n\n* The PCs are hired to rescue a petrified victim (possibly a friend, or a spy from their nation who has learned vital information) from the courtyard of the Karda. They have to identify the target among the stone menagerie and then either remove the statue from the Karda or perform the [[restoration]] in the districtâ€”all beneath the watchful eye of [[Xorchylic]] and its [[Flayer Guard]]!",
