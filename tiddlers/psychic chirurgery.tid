You can repair [[psychic damage|damage type]] or grant another creature knowledge of powers you know, depending on the version of this power you manifest.

//''Repair Psychic Damage.''// You can remove any compulsions, charms, or harmful mental effects affecting the subject, even personality-replacing conditions such as [[mind seed]]. These effects end or are negated as soon as this power is manifested. You also restore all [[harm]] that is psychic in nature.

//''Transfer Knowledge.''// If desired, you can use this power to directly transfer knowledge of a power you know to another [[psionic|psionics]] character. You can give a character knowledge of a power of any tier that they can manifest.
