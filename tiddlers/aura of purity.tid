type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Purifying energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. For up to 10 minutes (or until your concentration breaks), the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each nonhostile creature in the aura (including you) can't become [[disease]]d and has [[advantage]] to defend against poison and a host of other negative conditions: blinded, [[charm]]ed, frightened, paralyzed, etc.
