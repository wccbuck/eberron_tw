title: Veils
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Though small, this brothel has a stable of [[changeling]]s trained to mimic the accents and
mannerisms common to any of the [[Five Nations]]. In addition to traditional services, Veils also provides escorts trained to [[psionically|psionics]] pluck an image from the mind of a clientâ€”[[changeling]]s who can assume the form and mannerisms of a loved one, allowing an expatriate or traveling merchant to enjoy a meal or an evening in the company of someone lost through exile or slain in the war.
