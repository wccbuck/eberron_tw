These multicolored crystals are usually purchased in small bags at festivals and holiday events. You can throw one of these one-inch crystals against a solid surface to crack it apart. When a crystal breaks, it releases the illusory magic inside. The effect persists for about five seconds.

Firecracker crystals typically come in bags of 10. Roll a number of d8's equal to the number of crystals in the bag, and record each number rolled; use these numbers to determine the kinds of crystals found in the bag using the table below:

|!<<dr d8>> |!Color |!Effect |
| 1 |Red |Releases a harmless 5-foot-tall flame. |
| 2 |Orange |Releases a small flash of bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for another 5 feet, followed by the smell of spices and citrus. |
| 3 |Yellow |Releases small spiraling motes of energy that fizz and fly about in a 5-foot radius. |
| 4 |Green |Releases a cloud of bright, verdant smoke that fills a 5-foot sphere and smells sickly sweet. |
| 5 |Blue |Releases a series of comically large bubbles that float outward from the point of impact in a 5-foot radius. |
| 6 |Purple |Releases the sound of music. The song is random, and plays only enough to make it recognizable as music. |
| 7 |White |Releases a dazzling display of sparkling glitter in a 5-foot radius from the point of impact. |
| 8 |Black |Releases a mystery effect. Roll a <<dr d7>> and consult this table when using this crystal to determine its effect. |
