        "text": "King Sebastes ir'Kesslan rules [[New Galifar]] in [[Q'barra]] as a feudal realm. He is the \ngrandson of Duke [[Ven ir'Kesslan]], the founder of the settlement. During the deliberations over the [[Treaty of Thronehold]] in 996 YK, Sebastes (accompanied by High Elder [[Bhisma Na'kala Flamebrow]] of [[Ka'rhashan]]) was the representative that contended for the nationhood of Q'barra. \n\nSebastes is seen as a just monarch who truly cares for his people, and the law\nin New Galifar is modeled on that of old [[Galifar]] and\n(by extension) the [[Five Nations]]. Though Sebastes has\nno real influence in [[Hope]], some of the folk of that\nterritory look to him for aid and protection. \n\nKing Sebastes has worked hard to earn the\ntrust of [[dragonborn]] and [[lizardfolk]] leaders, and he\nhas forbidden any [[dragonshard]] mining in scale territory.\nUnfortunately, Sebastes’s reach is woefully limited,\nand what forces he has have been strained trying\nto protect his people from the increasingly aggressive actions of the [[Poison Dusk]]. On the surface, House [[Tharashk]] respects Sebastes’s edict, though Lord [[Khalar Velderan]] continues to lobby for a free hand in the region. \n\n!! Sebastes and the Inspired\n\nEberron [[dragonshard]]s are as useful to the [[psion]]s of\n[[Riedra]] as they are to the [[artificer]]s of [[Khorvaire]], and\nsuch shards are extremely rare in [[Sarlona]]. As a result,\nthe Riedrans are extremely interested in [[Q'barra]]. The [[Inspired]] ambassador [[Jhakanath]] has provided King\nSebastes with a garrison of troops to help defend his young nation, and a [[Riedra]]n quarter has sprung up in the city of [[Newthrone]]. Jhakanath is purchasing\nlarge quantities of shards from House [[Tharashk]], but\nthe [[Inspired]] have also secured permission to start\ntheir own mining operations. Nonetheless, the richest shard deposits lie in the lands of the [[scales]], and Sebastes won’t let the Riedrans threaten his relationship with the [[lizardfolk]] or [[dragonborn]]... yet.\n\nThe [[Inspired]] have ways of influencing people, and Sebastes might have dreams of the threat posed by the [[scales]]—dreams that encourage him to accept further aid from [[Riedra]], and to build up an army strong enough to seize land from the [[dragonborn]] and claim the kingdom his people deserve. Sebastes isn’t the only target for such influence; the Inspired can also further this goal by planting dreams in the minds of the dragonborn. Conflict in [[Q'barra]] serves the Inspired well, since it increases Sebastes’s need for Riedran troops.",
