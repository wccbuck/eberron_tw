        "text": "Political pressure from\nrival nations forced [[Aundair]] to recognize the [[Eldeen Reaches]] in the [[Treaty of Thronehold]], but few Aundairians are so willing to forgive the Reachers for what they see as a betrayal.\nForemost among those clamoring for a western war is\nLord Darro ir'Lain, the [[Queen|Aurala ir'Wynarn]]’s second warlord and\ncommander of the [[Knights Arcane]]. He has a detailed\nplan to invade and conquer the Eldeen Reaches,\nwresting the rich lands from the treacherous [[Wardens of the Wood]]. Many officials think the idea is folly, since [[Aundair]] is in no shape to mount a hostile\ncampaign, but Lord Darro is relentless. He agitates\nfor war, gathering support from nobles by making\npromises he likely can’t keep. Lord Darro courts the\n[[minister of magic|Adal ir'Wynarn]] at [[Arcanix]], believing that with the\naid of the minister—who is also the queen’s brother—he can force the queen to support his plan to invade and conquer the Reaches.\n\nDarro's disgraced uncle [[Vanson ir'Lain]] is a prominent member of the [[Lords of the Hunt]] in [[Stormreach]].",
