Every [[Aundair]]ian knows several add-a-verse songs. Popular as everything from children’s lullabies to drinking chanties, rhyming songs where a verse is added each time (such as “The House that [[Galifar]] Built” or “The 12 Days of End Year”) are an Aundairian tradition. Some run for nearly a hundred verses.
