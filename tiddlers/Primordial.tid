Primordial is the [[immortal]] [[language]] of sapient [[elemental]]s, a speech that forms part of the fundamental structure of reality. It is spoken across the [[plane]]s, from the [[efreet|efreeti]] of the [[City of Brass]] to the [[merfolk]] of the [[Endless Ocean]]. The language is sometimes broken up into different dialects by sages: Auran, Terran, Ignan, and Aquan, among others. 

Primordial forms a part of many mortal languages, including [[Zilasalza]], [[Sahuagin]], [[Shedani]], and [[Gith]].
