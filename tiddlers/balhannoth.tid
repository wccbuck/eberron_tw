type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The vicious, predatory balhannoth is a large ciliated ovoid [[aberration]] with six to eight tentacles and a gaping mouth of jagged teeth. The balhannoth alters reality in its lair to make the place appear inviting to travelers. Once they step inside, the balhannoth springs its trap.

Thanks to a limited form of telepathy, a balhannoth can sense the desires of other creatures and identify images of places where they expect those desires to be met. The balhannoth then warps reality around it, remaking its environment so that it matches the appearance of the place the creature seeks. The balhannoth never quite gets all the details right, and plenty of incongruities might give away the deception, but the imitation is good enough to fool desperate creatures into stumbling into the monster's clutches.

A balhannoth thrives on fear and despair, taking pleasure in the horror its victims experience. It terrorizes its prey by using its realityâ€”warping powers to mask its presence until it can snatch the target. Then it teleports away to feed on its victims.
