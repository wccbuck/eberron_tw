The sphere is encased in a filigree cage of polished [[mithral]] laurel leaves. A worthy wielder can cast [[turn undead]] for free at will. The orb can also be used to [[scry|scrying]] as a [[crystal ball]], with the added ability to [[detect thoughts]]. The orb also grants the wielder the ability to cast the spell [[heal]].\n\nThe wielder of the orb becomes increasingly\nunable to refuse pleas for help, no matter how desperate the cause. The last wielder of the Orb of Kevrik, who fancied herself a spiritual descendant of Kevrik himself, disappeared hundreds of years ago in the [[Demon Wastes]].",
