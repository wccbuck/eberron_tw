title: pipe of smoke monsters
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While smoking this pipe, you can exhale a puff of smoke that takes the form of a single creature, such as a [[dragon]], a [[pixie]], or a [[slaad]]. The form must be small enough to fit in a 1-foot cube and loses its shape after a few seconds, becoming an ordinary puff of smoke.
