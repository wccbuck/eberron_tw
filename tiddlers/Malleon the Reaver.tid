During [[Lhazaar]]’s colonization of [[Khorvaire]], Malleon Kas earned the sobriquet “the Reaver” due to his brutal slaughter of the native [[goblinoid]]s. He was a giant of a man, possessing immense strength and a fearsome glare. 

During his campaign, he bathed the southern shores of [[Khorvaire]] in [[goblin]] blood with his [[adamantine]] axe, //Redwave//. He also clashed with [[lizardfolk]] and [[kobold]]s of [[Q'barra]] and the [[gnome]]s of modern-day [[Zilargo]] before coming upon the [[Dhakaan]]i ruins of Duur'shaarat on the [[Dagger River]]. Subjugating the [[goblin]]s who dwelled in the ruins, Malleon rebuilt the city and named it Shaarat. 

Malleon and his descendants ruled a small kingdom in what is modern-day southwest [[Breland]] from the fortress of Shaarat for nearly 600 years, before [[Breggor Firstking]] of [[Wroat]] conquered the region and renamed the city [[Sharn]]. Today, the district of [[Malleon's Gate]] still bears the conqueror's name.
