A rather melancholy [[manticore]] is painted on the sign above the door, and not with any particular skill. A small star of [[Cyre]] on the dirty front window indicates that Cyran refugees are welcome. The tavern serves little more than bland ale and porridge.\n\nThe Manticore is owned and maintained by the [[halfling]] ''Dassi'', whose family immigrated to [[Breland]] from the [[Talenta Plains]].",
