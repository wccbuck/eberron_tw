        "text": "King Galifar Wynarn ([[-45 YKâ€”53 YK|Khorvaire calendar]]) was the founder of the Kingdom of [[Galifar]], uniting all [[Five Nations]] under one rule. He and representatives from the [[Twelve]] drafted and signed the [[Korth Edicts]], which defined the role of the [[dragonmarked house]]s within the kingdom for its entire duration, and are still used as guidance today. He also established the [[Arcane Congress]] in 15 YK. He was succeeded by his oldest surviving child [[Cyre Wynarn]], after he abdicated at the age of 85. Galifar's children, from oldest to youngest, were: [[Karrn|Karrn Wynarn]], [[Thrane|Thrane Wynarn]], [[Aundair|Aundair Wynarn]], [[Cyre|Cyre Wynarn]], and [[Brey|Brey Wynarn]].\n\nGalifar's kingdom would span the continent of [[Khorvaire]] for almost 900 years before the [[Last War]] sundered the nation.",
