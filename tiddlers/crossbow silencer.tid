This small magical band can be clamped to or removed from the stirrup of any [[crossbow]] in a few seconds. While the silencer is attached to a weapon, attempts to hear the weapon firing are made at [[disadvantage]]. This means that if you are hidden when you loose a bolt using the silencerâ€™s attached weapon, you have an [[advantage]] to stay hidden and not give away your location.
