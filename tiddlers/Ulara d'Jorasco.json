Ulara is a scholar first and foremost, and her expertise in ancient plagues proved instrumental in combating an epidemic that ran\nrampant through northwest [[Khorvaire]] a decade ago.\nBut she has less appetite for politics and diplomacy\nthan most of the other leaders of the [[dragonmarked house]]s, so she prefers to remain among her tomes and grimoires at her [[Vedykar]] villa within the [[enclave]] of [[Resthold]], directing house business through intermediaries and delegates. She rarely leaves her villa\nexcept when her expertise is required, but she’s far\nfrom a recluse. Advisors and functionaries come\nin and out of her villa in a continuous stream from\nsunup to sundown.",
