title: Upper Central
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Gold and power flow down from Upper Central. The
district of [[Highest Towers]] is the seat of government,
where city hall and the municipal archives are located.
The [[Korranath]] is the name of both the central financial
district and the grand temple of [[Kol Korran]] that dominates it. This district also houses the [[Kundarak Bank of Sharn]] and the [[Vaults]], House [[Kundarak]]'s ostensibly
impenetrable storage facility.

Some of Sharn's wealthiest citizens live in the [[Mithral Tower]] district, and [[Platinum Heights]] is the most expensive market district in Sharn. It has fewer shops than
the [[Bazaar]] of [[Dura]], but if you're looking for top-quality
goods or services, there's no finer—or more expensive—source to be found.

If you maintain no better than a poor lifestyle, many people in Upper Central will assume you're a servant or vagrant; this could cause you to have [[disadvantage]] on social attempts involving residents.
