Natives of [[Fernia]], azers are master crafters and expert miners. In appearance and manner, an azer resembles a [[dwarf]], but this is a facade. Beneath its metallic looking skin, an azer is an [[elemental]] being of fire, which outwardly manifests in its fiery hair and beard. 

The [[dao]] craft azers from bronze and bring them to life using the primordial spark of [[Fernia]]. They are tireless laborers who love working with fire and metals. Dao may
create the greatest wonders, but the azers do remarkable
workâ€”and far more of it. Azer are naturally gifted artisans,
and can be assigned to any sort of task that involves fire.
However, there are few things more miserable than an azer
baking bread instead of working with brass.
