''Population:'' <<ntls>>

Only 22 miles from the nearest [[Riedra]]n settlement
in the foothills of the [[Ahnadiv Mountains]], Shalquar is
the sister citadel of [[Malshashar]] and also on the front
lines of the ongoing conflict with Riedra. It serves as a
base for [[Adar]]'s defenders and a gate to Adar's interior.
Shalquar is carved between and under two mountains,
and inhospitable peaks surround it.
