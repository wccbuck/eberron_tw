        "text": "In Carosten Park, near the edge of the plateau, stands a small stone building. Passersby generally assume the building belongs to the park caretakers and pay it no heed, but it is actually a sacred site to the sect of [[druid]]s known as the [[Gatekeepers]]. From this small shrine in the midst of a “natural” site in the City of Towers, the Gatekeepers monitor the [[manifest zone]], the [[sewers|Sewers of Sharn]] and ruins below, and the activity of powerful spellcasters in [[Sharn]] to ensure that no dangerous [[planar|plane]] breach appears in the city. They are not overly concerned with ordinary summoning spells and have little worry that the [[angel]]s of [[Syrania]] are planning an invasion of the Material Plane, but they are deeply worried about recent events in the Depths.",
