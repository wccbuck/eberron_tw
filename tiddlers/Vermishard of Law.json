Lesser courtrooms and other public-facing\nfacilities were housed within the lower spire, with\narchives, offices, and Watch garrisons above. At\nthe summit, the Palace of Law held the chambers\nof the [[Metrol]] City Council, the mansion of the mayor, and\nthe great hall where nobles and other important\nfigures faced justice. Meanwhile, Metrol’s prisons—known as the Deep Prison—descend below the spire.",
