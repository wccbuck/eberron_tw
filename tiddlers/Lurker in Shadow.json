        "text": "During the [[Age of Demons]], the [[Thunder Sea]] was the domain of\nthe Lurker in Shadow. This [[overlord]] embodies the fear of the\nunknown, of the evil that could be lurking just beyond sight, and\nthe fear that our friends could be secretly scheming against us.\nThe Lurker created the [[aboleth]]s, who conquered and dominated\ncreatures of the deepâ€”[[giant]]s, [[dragon]]s, and [[sahuagin]]. The\nstruggle against the [[overlord]]s played out beneath the water\njust as it did above. [[Dragon|dragon]]s battled [[kraken]]s and [[giant]]s fought\n[[aboleth]]s, while the [[sahuagin]] consumed the fallen on both sides.\nThe wrath of the Lurker shattered the ocean floor. Dragons were\nimpaled on spires of [[demonglass]]. But in time, the overlords were\nbound and the aboleths fled into the deepest abysses.",
