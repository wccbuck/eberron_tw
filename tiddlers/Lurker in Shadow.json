        "text": "During the [[Age of Demons]], the [[Thunder Sea]] was the domain of\nthe Lurker in Shadow. This [[overlord]] embodies the fear of the\nunknown, of the evil that could be lurking just beyond sight, and\nthe fear that our friends could be secretly scheming against us.\nThe Lurker created the [[aboleth]]s, who conquered and dominated\ncreatures of the deepâ€”[[giant]]s, [[dragon]]s, and [[sahuagin]]. The\nstruggle against the [[overlord]]s played out beneath the water\njust as it did above. [[Dragon|dragon]]s battled [[kraken]]s and [[giant]]s fought\n[[aboleth]]s, while the [[sahuagin]] consumed the fallen on both sides.\nThe wrath of the Lurker shattered the ocean floor. Dragons were\nimpaled on spires of [[demonglass]]. But in time, the overlords were\nbound and the aboleths fled into the deepest abysses.\n\nThe servants of this [[overlord]] sometimes call it ''Surash Ka'', which is simply [[Abyssal]] for \"The Deep Lord\" or \"The King Below\", but the [[sahuagin]] and other denizens of the [[Thunder Sea]] avoid using that name, calling it the Lurker in Shadow or just the Lurker. It has no interaction with the [[Lords of Dust]]. Its servants include [[aboleth]]s, [[shadow demon]]s, and shark-aspected [[rakshasa]], but stories suggest these are the least of the horrors it has spawned. ",
