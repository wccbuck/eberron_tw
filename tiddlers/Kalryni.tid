type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Kalryni, a young [[blue dragon]], recently left her family in
the [[Thousand]] to join the meeting of colors and minds in
[[Vorel'arux]]. Kalryni’s color is fresh and lovely, a pale blue
azure like the sky at dawn; her mind is less developed.
Innocent almost to the point of naivete, Kalryni annoyed
her contemporaries, who soon found her endless drone
of questions and tangential remarks grating. Patient
[[Tapestry]] members are helping Kalryni develop her natural intelligence, but the process is tedious. To expedite her learning (and give the Tapestry a break from her
chatter), Kalryni was sent to study an ancient [[rakshasa]]
ruin. What exactly she is supposed to study, Kalryni’s not sure, but she takes great pride in her comprehensive sketches of the ruin and her preservation of several pretty rocks found among the debris.

Kalryni has never seen [[humanoid]]s before, and she
finds any encounters with them fascinating. She asks
every question that pops into her head, from dietary
requirements to mating rituals, and seems delighted at
any response. Her attention is both flattering and dangerous, however; the curious dragon sees nothing wrong with slicing open a nondragon for dissection purposes if
his comments intrigue her. At best, she might snatch up
one “experimental subject” to bring back to [[Vorel'arux]],
certain that such a unique find will garner great respect
from the [[Tapestry]].
