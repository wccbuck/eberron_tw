        "text": "The Ring makes up the bulk of the city of [[Zarash'ak]]. It surrounds the [[Heart]] and is constantly expanding. New levels are added to existing buildings, and new platforms are attached to the old.\nThis work is done by different architects with wildly\nvarying levels of skill, and the result is a ramshackle\npatchwork of a city. Some platforms have wide paths\nthat could almost be considered roads; on and around\nother platforms, rope ladders are the only way to\nmove from place to place. Most of the respected heirs\nof the house live in the [[Heart]], leaving the Ring to\ntraders, laborers, and travelers who can afford to stay\nout of the [[Webs]]. However, as the city’s population\ncontinues to grow, some members of the [[Tharashk]]\nclans are forced to settle in the Ring.\n\nIn general, the Ring is a bustling place. Merchants abound, offering everything from broiled slugs and handmade knives to healing salves and\n[[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]] charms. Beggars and thieves watch for\nunwary foreigners, and cultists of the [[Dragon Below|Cults of the Dragon Below]]\ntake to the streets in search of new recruits. It’s a\nwild and chaotic environment, with opportunities\nfor those seeking to make contact with Gatekeeper\ndruids, followers of the Dragon Below, or guides to\nthe deeper [[Marches|Shadow Marches]].",
