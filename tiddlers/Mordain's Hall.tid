title: Mordain's Hall
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The first confirmed sighting of the twisted hall of [[Mordain the Fleshweaver]] occured in 873 YK, during the [[Silver Crusade]]. A troop of [[Aundair]]ian [[templar]]s pursued a few [[werewolves|therianthrope]] far to the south of the [[Towering Wood]]. Weeks later, another patrol encountered a lone survivor, half-mad and delirious. He spoke of a tower "with blackened, leathery walls, twisted as the limb of a dragon reaching up to grasp the sun." The soldier couldn't account for his companions, and his own condition was testimony to the horrors he had seen. His body had been magically conjoined to the body of a werewolf. His mental state quickly deteriorated and he soon died of self-inflicted wounds.

The location of Mordain's Hall (which some refer to as "Blackroot", though a [[village|Blackroot]] in the [[Shadow Marches]] shares that name) has long since been confirmed, though the tower is shielded from [[scrying]] and other [[divination]]. The windowless tower appears to be made from the flesh of a [[black dragon]]; the walls bleed if damaged, though they regenerate at an astonishing rate. Virtuous champions have set out to the tower and the [[Forest of Flesh]] that surrounds it to destroy the foul wizard and his works. Emissaries from the [[Five Nations]] sought his aid the [[Last War]], and mages have dreamed of stealing his secrets. However, few gaze on the face of [[Mordain|Mordain the Fleshweaver]] and return unchanged... if they return at all.

[[Mordain|Mordain the Fleshweaver]] never leaves his hall. It’s quite possible that through his centuries of work, Mordain has essentially //become// Blackroot—that his physical body is just a shell he creates to interact with people, but that the true Mordain is merged with his tower.
