Ashardalon was a powerful [[red dragon]] during the [[Age of Demons]] who resorted to using demonic forces to extend his own life indefinitely. According to the myths of [[Thir]], Ashardalon bound a [[balor]] and other [[fiend]]s into his body, but this was insufficient to stop his march to the grave. Eventually, it is said he traveled to the space between [[plane]]s and established a lair set apart from the flow of time.
