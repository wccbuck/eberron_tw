type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This silver spear has a scarf of ghostly blue silk tied around the end. When the user utters the command word and throws the spear, three ghostly yet deadly copies of the spear appear alongside it, slamming into the target before fading into mist. This power can be used three times before it must be charged under the light of a [[moon]].
