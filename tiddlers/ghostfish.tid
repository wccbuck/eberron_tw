The ghostfish is a large, freshwater fish native to the rivers of [[Aundair]]. It is similar to a trout, with one key difference: the ghostfish is invisible. This bizarre condition persists even after the fish is killed, and many diners relish ghostfish just for the experience of eating an invisible meal. Ghostfish are often served in the [[Glass House]] in [[Sharn]].
