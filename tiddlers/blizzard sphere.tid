title: blizzard sphere
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This glass sphere contains a raging blizzard. It's cold to the touch, and vibrates with the gusts of wind trapped within. When the orb is thrown, it shatters on impact, releasing the blizzard in a 20-foot radius sphere of swirling ice and snow centered on the point of impact. Creatures in the area suffer extreme cold, slowed movement, and very limited visibility. The blizzard persists for up to 30 seconds, or until targeted by a [[dispel magic]] spell.
