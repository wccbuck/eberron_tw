type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

If adventurers visit one of the [[plane]]s, they'll find it has certain
unnatural properties that can be felt consistently throughout
the entire plane of existence. A plane's universal properties
can often be felt on [[Eberron]] itself; one of the most common
effects of [[manifest zone]]s is to extend one or more of that
plane's universal properties into the Material Plane, sometimes
reliably, other times unpredictably. A plane's universal properties generally apply to all creatures within that plane.

Time doesn't pass at the same rate on every plane; it could
move faster, slower, or even unpredictably. The duration of magical effects changes based on the flow of time the target is currently experiencing.
