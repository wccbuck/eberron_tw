Harysh is the proprietor of the popular [[Stormreach]] inn, the [[Ship's Cat]], and has a reputation for honor, hospitality, fairness, and discretion. The woman appears to be is a good-natured [[shifter]] with a genuine, if strangely obsessive, love for street cats. And that’s precisely what she is—or, rather, what she //was//.

The "real" Harysh has been incapacitated, her soul trapped in a [[Khyber shard|dragonshard]]. The Harysh visible today is actually the [[rakshasa]] [[Lorishto]].
