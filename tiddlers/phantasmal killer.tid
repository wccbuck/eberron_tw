You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within 120 feet and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. If the target is unable to resist the illusion, the target becomes frightened for up to a minute. The target repeatedly suffers psychic damage until the spell ends.
