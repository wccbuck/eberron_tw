It was part of the united armies of\n[[Galifar]], and cult chapters can be found in all of the armies of\nthe [[Five Nations]]. Sect meetings provide a place for soldiers\nand veterans to interact as friends and equals, regardless of\nrank or nationality. The cult asserts that honor and courage\nare to be valued, but there is also a time and place for cunning\nand cruelty, even if it is never to be desired.\n\n!! The Rage of War\n\nAlthough some branches of the Three Faces\nof War are just what they appear to be, [[Mordakhesh]] the Shadowsword\nhas corrupted many others among its cells. Since a\nlarge number of the members of the sect are officers,\nMordakhesh relishes the opportunity to shape the\noverall conduct of the coming warâ€”promoting brutality and the pursuit of vengeance.",
