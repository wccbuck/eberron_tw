Essyn Cadrel is a close confidant of [[Oargev ir'Wynarn]]. He is a charming and sharp-eyed man who often dresses in bright silks. Before the [[Mourning]], Cadrel was a courtier in Queen [[Dannel|Dannel ir'Wynarn]]'s entourage who was celebrated for his razor wit and [[enchanting|enchantment]] [[musical talents|bard]]. While he was seen as something of a rake and a gossip, Cadrel oversaw a web of intrigues in the court. Today, he has remained close to Prince Oargev and serves as his advisor and fixer. While Oargev is a passionate man, he was raised as a noble and a knight, not a schemer; it is Essyn Cadrel who pulls the threads scattered across the shadows.

Essyn Cadrel also speaks for Prince [[Oargev|Oargev ir'Wynarn]] at gatherings of the [[Covenant of the Gray Mist]].
