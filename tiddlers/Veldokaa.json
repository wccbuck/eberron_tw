Even while the [[leadership|Daric d'Velderan]] of Velderan mediates between [[Torrn]] and [['Aashta]], the Veldokaa makes sure to keep their tensions alive so that they rarely ally against Velderan interests. Likewise, while â€˜Aashta is most obvious in its ambition and aggression, the Veldokaa engage in more subtle sabotage of rivals. \n\nThe Veldokaa often make use of Clan [[Orgaal]] as spies and observers.",
