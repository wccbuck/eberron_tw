In [[Dal Quor]], these changes are generally drawn from the mind of the current dreamer, but at the GM's discretion, the thoughts of adventurers might impact another creature's dream that they're currently experiencing. The table below provides ideas for how a dreamscape could change.\n\n| !<<dr d8>> |!Shifting Dream Event |\n| 1 |A familiar melody can be heard throughout the area. Ask a player to describe the song. |\n| 2 |A word appears on the wall. Is it a clue, or just mysterious? |\n| 3 |A familiar NPC—a trusted ally or despised villain—enters. |\n| 4 |A creature's weapon, armor, or other equipment takes on an irrational new appearance—perhaps a giant banana. This has no effect on its statistics, and the effect ends in 1 minute. |\n| 5 |A creature now appears to be a child or a creature of another race. This has no effect on their abilities, and the effect ends in 1 minute. |\n| 6 |A creature's beloved pet—perhaps from their childhood—appears in the scene. |\n| 7 |There's a dramatic—and possibly surreal—shift in the weather or apparent time of day. |\n| 8 |A creature gains the ability to fly as fast as they can normally walk. This lasts for 1 minute. |",
