With\nits large stage, copious seating (it seats 1,000 comfortably), and renowned artist-in-residence, the\nDiamond manages to exude an air of sophistication in a ward all about base entertainment. [[Luca Syara]], the Diamond's resident playwright, is the\nhottest thing going in [[Sharn]]'s entertainment world\nat present. Many of her plays wrestle seriously with\nissues raised by the [[Last War]], exploring themes of\nnationalism, shattered idealism, alienation and\ngrief, and the search for meaning in a war-ravaged\nworld. For many, such serious, modern plays hold no interest and draw nothing but derision, but even those who hate her still talk about her. Her contract with the Diamond expires in another year, and certain circles buzz constantly with speculation about what [[upper-ward|upper ward]] theater will snatch her up at that point.",
