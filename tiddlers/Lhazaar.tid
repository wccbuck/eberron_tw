Lhazaar was a legendary explorer and pirate who led the first [[human]] expedition from [[Sarlona]] to [[Khorvaire]], around two millennia before the founding of the Kingdom of [[Galifar]]. Her namesake lives on in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] as well as the [[Lhazaar Sea]].

Some three thousand years before the present age, a
flotilla of ships left the land even then called [[Rhiavhaar]],
bound west across the [[Sea of Rage]]. The leader of this exodus was an explorer named Lhazaar. Though many Khorvairian humans are unaware that Lhazaar's expedition was the beginning of human society on [[Khorvaire]], all know her name.

!! Onsten's Theory of Lhazaar

Recently, a controversial theory has been gaining
favor in academic circles, seeking to explain why the tale
of Lhazaar's expedition has always been an obscure part
of Khorvairian history. Ellias Onsten, a little-known
[[Korranberg Library|Library of Korranberg]] researcher whose reputation faded
even further after his death in 980 YK, was responsible
for a revisionist look at Lhazaar's expedition.

Even prior to the end of the [[Last War]], Onsten had
studied the fragmentary histories of the sorcerer-kings of
ancient [[Sarlona]]. To him, it had always seemed odd that the
first waves of [[human]]s to reach [[Khorvaire]] had brought precious little in the way of magical knowledge with them.

Onsten observed that migrant populations typically
hold to their former cultures at any cost—building new
culture on a rigid foundation of the customs and traditions of their ancestors. However, almost from the first, the early humans of Khorvaire seemed intent on turning
their back on the traditions and history of their former
homeland. This led Onsten to conjecture that the first
humans to settle Khorvaire might well have been a population that Sarlona did not want.

Today, those Khorvairians who know Lhazaar's story
think of themselves as the descendants of brave explorers
and seekers after glory. Onsten's less attractive notion is
that the descendants of untouchables, criminals, deserters, and slaves instead populate Khorvaire. The notion of slave culture was of particular interest to the scholar (and
of particular abhorrence to his critics), suggesting as it
did a reason why the early Khorvairians were so quick to
enslave the [[goblin]]s of fallen [[Dhakaan]]. In Onsten's view,
the strong controlling the weak was the only world these
human immigrants knew.

Onsten's hypothesis has recently gained ground among
scholars. To them, a culture built entirely by people who
have a vested interest in forgetting who they had once been
might look very much like Khorvaire's—people turning their backs on the traditions that glorified those who had oppressed them. Many of the learned in Khorvaire
sympathize with the idea of a people who turned away
from the sorcerous traditions of their lords because those
traditions ultimately turned their lands to ash.

Whatever the origins of Lhazaar's expedition, the
second wave of human migrants to hit Khorvaire sailed
west under better-known circumstances. Refugees fleeing the rising power of [[Riedra]] pushed east into the forests of [[Nulakesh]], then beyond. These humans landed on
Khorvaire's western shores, spreading into the [[Shadow Marches]] where they remain today.
