Mils Holt is a priest and [[adept]] of the [[Sovereign Host]] who maintains the old temple in [[Sylbaran]]. He is an [[elf]] who has lived in the region for hundreds of years. Mils supports the [[Eldeen Reaches]], but prefers the old ways of [[Boldrei]] and [[Arawai]] to the [[druid]]ic traditions. He performs the rituals of the [[Sovereign Host]] for local Vassals and travelers. Mils is wise and often has sound advice to offer, but the only spell he can reliably cast is [[ceremony]]. However, on occasion he has had divine visions—mirroring the effects of [[commune]] or [[augury]]—relating to travelers in need.
