title: armor of fungal spores
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While wearing this armor, you can make the armor emit poisonous spores, which fill a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on yourself. Each creature in that area that inhales the spores is poisoned (as a [[basic poison]]). The spores linger in the air for about 30 seconds. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
