Tarkanan channeled his power over elemental earth and fire through this gauntlet, which focused and amplified this power to a staggering degree, enough to level an entire city.\n\nThe Earth's Fist was buried in the collapse of [[Dorasharn|Sharn]] almost fifteen hundred years ago, but it is possible it can still be found in the ruins of [[Old Sharn]]. The gauntlet was designed to interface with Halas's unique [[aberrant dragonmark]], but a creature with a similar dragonmark may be able to [[attune|attunement]] to this deadly artifact.",
