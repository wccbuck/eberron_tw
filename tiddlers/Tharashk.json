I use mine to find fugitives in the slums of [[Sharn]]. I'm still a hunter. I always find my mark.//\n\n<div align=\"right\">—Hondar'Aashta, Tharashk bounty hunter</div>\n\nHouse Tharashk traditionally licenses [[inquisitive]]s and\nbounty hunters. Recently the house's [[Finders Guild]] has\nexpanded into [[dragonshard]] prospecting. As dragonshards are the lifeblood of the magical economy, the\nhouse's talent has given them new wealth and influence.\n\nTharashk is the youngest of the [[dragonmarked house]]s\nand hasn't embraced all the customs of the others. The\ndistinct clans that united to form the house remain important, and heirs of the family usually retain their family\nnames rather than adopting \"d'Tharashk\" as tradition\ndictates. Each of the three major clans—the [[Aashta]], the\n[[Torrn]], and the [[Velderan]]—has a representative on the [[Tharashk triumvirate]] that governs the house, and the city of [[Zarash'ak]]\nin the [[Shadow Marches]]. Together, they stand as one under the emblem of the [[liondrake]] (sometimes called a dragonne or gamelyon). \n\n!! History of House {{!!title}}\n\nThe [[Mark of Finding]] manifested about 1,000 years\nago among three [[Shadow Marches]] clans—the [[Torrn]]s,\nthe [[Velderan]]s, and the [[Aashta]]s. The exploits of [[dragonmark]]ed hunters quickly became legendary. Three\nhundred years ago, a team of [[Sivis]] [[gnome]]s came to\nthe Shadow Marches searching for this dragonmark.\nAssisted by the gnomes, the clans bearing the [[Mark of Finding]] joined to form their own house. They named the house Tharashk—a [[Goblin]] word meaning “united.”\n\nThe newborn house quickly carved out a niche\nfor itself. The heirs of Tharashk have always been\nsurvivors, and they quickly adapted to life in the [[Five Nations]]. The [[Shadow Marches]] have rich deposits of\n[[dragonshard]]s, and upon learning the value of these\nstones the clans of Tharashk used this mineral wealth\nto craft a foundation for their house. Since then, their\npower and influence has slowly grown. There are still\nthose in the [[Five Nations]] who distrust the “graybloods,”\nbut by and large House Tharashk has flourished.\n\n!!! The Last War\n\nInitially, the [[Last War]] had little impact\non House Tharashk; its prospecting work occurred in\nthe wilds of the [[Shadow Marches]] and [[Q'barra]], far from the battlefields. The house was often called upon for search-and-rescue work, but the profits\nfrom this activity were minor compared to prospecting.\n\nThe aspect of the war that had the greatest\nimpact on the house was the rise of [[Droaam]]. House\nTharashk has formed strong ties with the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]]. The house is helping the Daughters locate and mine the resources of their lands, and brokering the services of monstrous mercenaries... and\nprofiting from both.\n\n!!
