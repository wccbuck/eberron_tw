        "text": "The ruins of the city of [[Making]] in the [[Mournland]] is surrounded by a nightmare tableland of flat, pale glass. Jagged formations like blown glass,\nsometimes enormous in size, jut up from the ground\nhere and there. Obsidian makes up the central plateau, forming bladelike protrusions. Liquid glass and magma ooze around the edges of the highland, and\nfire flashes deep under the glass. Nothing grows on the plateau, and few creatures haunt its jagged peaks and flat expanse. [[Living spell|living spell]]s, on the other hand, seem drawn to the area.\n\n!! Marks of the Obsidian Flow\n\nAgainst the southwestern slope of the Glass Plateau, there are structures resembling waterfalls of dark black glass, frozen as they flowed down from the top of the plateau. According to rumors, when a pivotal fragment of the [[Draconic Prophecy]] is nearby, a series of silver symbols will appear on the black glass, before they fade and another set appears, and so on, until the sequence completes and fades away. These sequences are said to give clues to how fragments of the Prophecy link together.",
