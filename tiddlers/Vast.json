        "text": "In [[Draconic]], this territory is called //Dja’Valarach//. In\n[[Common]], it is typically translated as “the Vast,” interpreted as a great void or open space. But to a [[dragon]], the word holds far deeper meaning. It is the space\naround a dragon in flight. It is the freedom to move\nin any direction. It hints at the infinite possibilities\nof the future, unbound and vast. That is what the Vast\nrepresents to the dragons of [[Argonnessen]]—freedom and uncertainty. It is a land without rules, where dragons are free to exult in their power and might,\nto match wits with other dragons and to rule over lesser creatures.\n\nFirst and foremost, the Vast is a proving ground. When a [[dragon]] of the [[Thousand]] becomes a young adult, it is given the choice to serve the [[Light of Siberys]] or to find its own way in the Vast. Those who go to the Vast must remain there for at least fifty years; those who survive to become adults might return to the [[Thousand]] and claim a lair within the dominion of their flight. However, some choose to remain in the Vast. These dragons prefer the challenge and uncertainty of life in this land. Life in the Thousand is stable, but stagnant. In the Vast, a dragon can be a conqueror, a tyrant, or a defender of the innocent. Every day could end in a life-or-death struggle, and for many dragons, that thrill is worth the risk.\n\n!! Industries\n\nAlthough no industries span the territory, many\ndominion lords (see Government and Politics, below)\nforce their subjects to mine for ores and precious\ngems, and to produce goods worthy of a [[dragon]]’s\nhoard. A dominion lord might use these goods to\nbarter with other dragons, potentially trading treasure for slaves as a [[human]] might purchase livestock, or offering tribute in exchange for a temporary alliance against another dragon.\n\nThe Vast also trades in nondragons. In addition to\n“importing” creatures from other continents, dragons\nof the Vast are the primary source for the nondragons\nfound in other territories. A dragon who returns to\nthe [[Thousand]] could bring retainers with him, while a\ndragon of the [[Tapestry]] might recruit research assistants\nfrom [[Io'lokar]].\n\n!! Life and Society\n\nThe [[dragon]]s of the Vast are free to do whatever they want.\nLife is a deadly game, with living creatures as the pawns.\nA dragon can take any land that he can hold, and any\nother dragon can try to take it from him. Gold, treasure,\nslaves—all these are part of the game of power, the never-ending struggle for status. Some dragons revel in the violence and spend their days hunting the most challenging\nprey that they can find. Some live in hedonistic splendor\namong nondragons who worship them. A few actually\nenjoy protecting lesser creatures; they take pleasure in\ndefending their subjects from the depredations of cruel\nravagers and rulers.\n\nThe [[dragon]]s of the Vast relish their conflicts with\nother dragons. These contests can be drawn out over\nmonths or years. A victorious dragon often spares his\nvictim in their first battle, to give the loser time to\ncontemplate the loss and prepare for his final defeat.\nAlthough some ravagers thrive on blood and rage, for most dragons, the game is more satisfying than the actual victory. The conflict, not the resolution, is the event to be savored.\n\n!! Government and Politics\n\nA [[dragon]] who establishes and holds a significant area in the Vast is known as a dominion lord. His status in the eyes of the other lords is based on the size of his domain, his hoard, the number of [[dragonborn]] or other nondragons he commands,\nand the number and nature of dragons he has defeated.\nThough age is typically a factor, achievement is just as\nimportant in the Vast; if a young dragon can consistently\ndefeat his elders, he will gain respect... and become a\ntarget for others.\n\nMany dragons leave the Vast after becoming adults.\nMany more don’t survive to adulthood. But some\nremain in the Vast for their entire lives. These elder\ndominion lords rarely challenge the young; slaying a\nyoung adult black dragon provides little challenge or\nsatisfaction for a gold great wyrm. These elders continue to play their games with others of similar age, but they also work to maintain the Vast. They import\nnew monsters to replace those slain in battle. They do\nwhat is necessary to keep the nondragon population\nwithin manageable levels, and restock the supplies if\nthe population falls too low. And they represent the\nVast in the [[Conclave]] of [[Argonnessen]]. They rarely speak\nwith one voice, but they defend their way of life and the\nimportance of this free realm.\n\n!! Nondragons in the Vast\n\nThe Vast has the highest nondragon population of any\nof the territories. These lesser races have been brought\nto [[Argonnessen]] over the course of a hundred thousand\nyears. [[Hobgoblin|hobgoblin]]s, whose ancestors were saved from the downfall of the Empire of [[Dhakaan]], still sing the songs of the duur’kala—the Dhakaani [[dirge singer]]s. [[Elves|elf]], whose ancestors were brought from the shores of\n[[Xen'drik]] long before the [[elf–giant wars|Age of Giants]], know nothing\nof the [[Undying Court]] or the [[Tairnadal]]. There are nondragons never seen in [[Khorvaire]], members of races that were exterminated by the [[giant]]s or the [[daelkyr]]. Other races, such as the [[dragonborn]], originated on [[Argonnessen]] and dwell in city-states throughout the Vast. The range of communities that can be found are dizzying. Some are metropolitan, with members of a dozen races\nliving under one roof. Other communities are racially\nisolated, steadfastly preserving secrets of their forgotten cultures.\n\nOf course, all these creatures have one aspect in common: They live beneath the shadow of the [[dragon]] lords. To a dominion lord, nondragons are an extension of his hoard. Other dragons might try to steal creatures from his domain, or just slaughter his subjects; life is always uncertain, and an attack could come at any time. Two dominion lords could have completely different styles of rule. Some make frequent shows of force and often require living sacrifices. A few demand worship, and in some cases, their subjects truly believe that these dragons are deities; a few of the oldest dominion lords have developed cadres of fanatical soldiers ready to die for their dragon masters. Life in the Vast can be brutal and short, but the people of this land know little else.\n\n!! Important Sites\n\n[[Argonnessen]] adventurers are most familiar with the Vast. Although few people have entered Argonnessen and returned to speak of it, many have heard tales of [[Totem Beach]] and the mountains of the [[Great Barrier|Great Barrier Mountains]]. A few have even heard tales of [[Io'lokar]], the legendary City of Knowledge.\n\n!!! Cities and Ruins\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}tag[city]] [tag{!!title}tag[ruin]] +[sort[title]]\">>\n\n!!! Other Sites\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}!tag[city]!tag[ruin]sort[title]]:filter[get[text]length[]compare:integer:gt[200]]\">>\n\n!! Adventure Seeds\n\nThe Vast is a dangerous land. Its founders have populated it with vicious monsters from across [[Eberron]], creatures intended to pose a threat to dragons. Thus, almost any beast imaginable could be encountered in the Vast. Furthermore, the dominion lords are always looking for a new challenge, and a party of adventurers makes excellent sport. That said, the Vast is actually one of the best areas for adventurers to explore. Because of the large nondragon population, PCs might be able to blend in with the locals, or find temporary shelter. The constant struggle between dragons also provides adventurers with an opportunity to gain dragon allies—although they have to be careful not to draw down the wrath of the elder dominion lords.\n\n''Ultimate Hunt:'' After being drugged or incapacitated by magical means, the PCs wake in the domain of a powerful [[dragon]]. This [[stalking wyrm]] seeks challenging prey, and the adventurers’ reputation has earned them this dubious honor. If they can survive for 24 hours, they will be rewarded and sent home. Let the game begin!\n\n''Hidden Seer:'' The conflict between the warring [[Heirs of Dhakaan]] is at a critical point. [[Tuura Dhakaan]] contacts the adventurers. If they help her take the throne, she swears to keep the Dhakaani from threatening the [[Five Nations]]. To complete the ritual of coronation, she needs to be blessed by a Dhakaani crown seer. Only one is left in the world, and she lives in the city of [[Io'lokar]]. Can the party reach her and convince her to return to the land of her ancestors?\n\n''Lost Village:'' Rumors suggest that a village was taken from [[Cyre]] just before the Day of [[Mourning]], that elders of the Vast transported the entire village to [[Argonnessen]]. Perhaps the village held secrets of House [[Cannith]]. Or maybe Queen [[Dannel|Dannel ir'Wynarn]] herself was passing through the village on the day she was thought lost. Is the Queen of Cyre still alive, trapped in servitude in the land of the dragons?",
