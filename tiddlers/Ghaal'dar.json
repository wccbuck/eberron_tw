[[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]] are the leaders of the\nGhaal'dar, enforcing their will on their [[goblin]] and [[bugbear]] peers; in fact, the [[Dhakaani]] word \"ghaal'dar\" simply means \"hobgoblin.\" The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting [[Galifar]] or [[Zilargo]], the\ntribes usually turned on one another. This came to an\nend with the [[Last War]]. House [[Deneith]] hired Ghaal'dar\nmercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes.\nA brilliant hobgoblin, [[Haruuc Shaarat'kor]], united the Ghaal'dar,\nand under his leadership they seized control of what is\nnow [[Darguun]]. The aging Lhesh Haruuc\nremains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his\ndeath could throw the region into chaos.\n\nThe Ghaal'dar are an alliance of tribes. The Lhesh [[Haruuc|Haruuc Shaarat'kor]] belongs to the largest of these, the [[Rhukaan Taash]] (\"Razor Crown\"). Others include the following:\n\n* the [[Gantii Vus]] (\"Hungry Flame\")\n* the [[Kapaa Dor]] (\"Never Betray\")\n* the [[Gan'duur]] (\"Eaters of Sorrow\")\n* the ''Ja'aram'' (\"Bright Anger\")\n* the ''Mur Talaan'' (\"Horned Shoulders\")\n* the ''Marhaan'' (\"Cyclones\")\n* the ''Ghaal Sehn'' (\"Mighty Riders,\" a wealthy mercenary tribe)\n* the ''Pin Galaac'' (\"Screeching Bats\")",
