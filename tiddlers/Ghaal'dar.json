        "text": "The Ghaal'dar [[goblinoid]] tribes arose from the remnants of the\n[[Dhakaan]]i Empire. [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]] are the leaders of the\nGhaal'dar, enforcing their will on their [[goblin]] and [[bugbear]] peers; in fact, the Dhakaani word \"ghaal'dar\" simply means \"hobgoblin\". The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting [[Galifar]] or [[Zilargo]], the\ntribes usually turned on one another. This came to an\nend with the [[Last War]]. House [[Deneith]] hired Ghaal'dar\nmercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes.\nA brilliant hobgoblin, [[Haruuc Shaarat'kor]], united the Ghaal'dar,\nand under his leadership they seized control of what is\nnow [[Darguun]]. The aging Lhesh Haruuc\nremains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his\ndeath could throw the region into chaos.\n\nThe Ghaal'dar are an alliance of tribes. The Lhesh [[Haruuc|Haruuc Shaarat'kor]] belongs to the largest of these, the Rhukaan Taash. The name means “Razor Crown,” and a line of\nscars encircles the head of each Rhukaan warrior, the\nresult of a ritual marking when a hobgoblin becomes\na soldier. The Lhesh Haruuc has greatly improved the\nlives of his people, but unless he finds a capable successor, the Ghaal'dar chieftains seem certain to turn\non one another once he is gone.",
