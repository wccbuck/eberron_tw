Ryla d'[[Ghallanda]] is the daughter of the founders of the [[Dragon's Hoard]] resort in [[Sharn]], one of the wealthiest branches of the house. Though she has earned a reputation as a spoiled and vapid youth, Ryla is more capable than she appears.

Her parents have a great deal of influence in House [[Ghallanda]] and could be valuable allies or dangerous enemies for player characters. Ryla might turn up at an exclusive party where the adventurers are engaged in delicate undercover work, or she could take an interest in the adventuring life and stow away on the PCsâ€™ next expedition.
