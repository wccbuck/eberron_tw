It was named after [[Keeper of the Flame]] Jareen Imistil (698â€“768 [[YK|Modern Age]]).\n\nDuring the Empire of [[Dhakaan]], the Imistil was part of a great forest that stretched from the [[Blackcap Mountains]] to [[Scions Sound]]. Over time, the forest was cleared by settlers, leaving only a few regions drenched in [[primal power|primal magic]] where mortals feared to tread. The Imistil Forest is one of these regions, and it is populated by a community of [[firbolg]]s, the self-professed children of the [[Forest Queen]].",
