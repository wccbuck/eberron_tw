Mutated [[kuo-toa]] and other [[aberrant|aberration]] creatures
occupy this abandoned city in the [[Mournland]], which was once a major
stop on the [[lightning rail]]. The cityscape has been
warped beyond recognition. Its inhabitants raid the
[[Talenta Plains]] from their twisted homes in Tronish,
or from holds near [[Lake Cyre]] or the [[Crimson Water]].

The [[halfling]]s of [[Gatherhold]] whisper that some
nameless horror directs the activity in Tronish from
the depths of one of those bodies of water. They
note the weird lights that flash and glow in western
Lake Cyre.
