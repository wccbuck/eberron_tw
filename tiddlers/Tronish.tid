The abandoned [[Cyran|Cyre]] city of Tronish was once a major stop on the [[lightning rail]]. Today, the city lies in complete silence, and the cityscape has been warped beyond recognition. 

The last sound heard in the city on the Day of [[Mourning]] was a wail of despair as the mists swept over the land. Today, magical [[silence]] blankets the entire city. Within its walls, a visitor cannot hear nor create any sound. 

The clothes and belongings of Tronish's citizens lay scattered about, with anything made of flesh and blood seemingly evaporated. Mutated [[kuo-toa]] and other [[aberrant|aberration]] creatures—perhaps the remnants of the city's vanished residents—now occupy this abandoned city. Its inhabitants raid the [[Talenta Plains]] from their twisted homes in Tronish,
or from holds near [[Lake Cyre]] or the [[Crimson Water]].

The [[halfling]]s of [[Gatherhold]] whisper that some
nameless horror directs the activity in Tronish from
the depths of one of those bodies of water. They
note the weird lights that flash and glow in western
[[Lake Cyre]].
