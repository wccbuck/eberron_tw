Tsoreva [[quori]] serve as expendable troops in any battle on [[Dal Quor]] or as [[Inspired]] shock troopers on [[Eberron]]. These quori embody pure spite and relish battle. They serve as the infantry under a [[du'ulora]]'s command. Every tsoreva wants only to die well, returning as an honored soldier to the [[Dreaming Dark]].
