Scholars who study the [[sahuagin]] know of malenti, sahuagin that are born
indistinguishable from [[sea elves|sea elf]]; the common belief is that this
is a random mutation that occurs when sahuagin and sea elves
live in close proximity. The sahuagin are happy to support this
myth, because the truth is far more disturbing: Malenti aren’t born, they’re made. One of the sacred rituals of the [[Eternal Dominion]] allows a [[sahuagin]] priest of [[Sha'argon|Devourer]] to guide a subject through ritually
consuming a [[humanoid]]—and in consuming the creature, the
sahuagin becomes that creature, taking both their form and their powers. People know about [[sea elf]] malenti, as they’ve been caught and exposed in the Dominion’s long war with the [[Valraean Protectorate]]. But unbeknownst to the [[Five Nations]], there are
[[human]] malenti in [[Sharn]], [[dwarf]] malenti in [[Stormreach]], malenti
passing as many races and traveling the surface wherever the
Dominion needs eyes and hands.
