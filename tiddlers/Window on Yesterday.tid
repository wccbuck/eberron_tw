type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Kidro Osanak owns Window on Yesterday ([[Little Xen'drik]] market, [[Seventh Tower]], [[Sharn]]). A wizened old [[gnome]], Kidro harbors a deep resentment toward Haga Wissel of [[Echoes of the Past]], and though he can't prove it, believes that she has stolen
items from his shop. One of the only dealers in Little Xen'drik with more interest in the historical significance contained in his treasures than in their monetary worth, Kidro often sponsors the most challenging expeditions.
