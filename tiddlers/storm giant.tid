Storm [[giant]]s have pale purple-gray skin and hair, and glittering emerald eyes. Some rare storm giants are violet-skinned, with deep violet or blue-black hair and silvery gray or purple eyes. Their average height is around 26 ft. They are masters of the storm, able to hurl lightning bolts and control weather. 

Some venerable storm giants are gifted oracles, reading omens and finding patterns in the world that foretell fortunes and uncover secrets long forgotten.

Storm giants once had a presence along the coastline of
[[Xen'drik]]. After devastating conflicts with several [[sahuagin]]
nations, they were all but wiped out. Today, they are generally
known only through the ruins and tombs they left behind,
usually protected by powerful magic and left alone by the
[[Eternal Dominion]]. There are still a few storm giants in hiding deep beneath the waves of the [[Thunder Sea]]; most are shadows of their former glory, but there may still be a
few hidden giants who have preserved their ancient powers.
