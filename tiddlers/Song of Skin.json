        "text": "This establishment serves hot beverages and simple food. Unusual in that most of its clientele are [[changeling]]s, it is a place for quiet conversation and meditation. Song of Skin changelings perform guided meditations in which a dozen people travel through\na journey of different bodies, forming and abandoning\na dozen different forms. The proprietor is a changeling\nnamed Silence. It is quite likely that Silence is in fact a\ngroup identity shared by multiple changelings; their alignment and abilities could change each day. Silence enjoys listening to the tales of\ntravelers, and has a special service for favored customers:\nthey produce and sell [[psionic tattoo]]s. It is up to you to\ndecide what they have available at any given time and what it\nwill take to convince them to sell. \n\nThere are many questions surrounding the Song of\nSkin. Why do the [[Inspired]] allow Silence to sell tattoos?\nWhat is their motivation? It's quite possible that Silence is\na creation of the [[Thousand Eyes]] and passes all information along to that group. On the other hand, perhaps Silence is a spiritual creation of the [[changeling]]s of Dar\nJin who serves as a focus for their belief in the [[Path of Inspiration]]. Either way, the Song of Skin could serve as a sanctuary for changeling dissidents such as [[Keshraa the Fallen]]. ",
