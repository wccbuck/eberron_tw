Gjitha is a town in [[Khunan]], [[Syrkarn]], located on the coast of the [[Xofre Bay]]. The town has long served as a port of call for ships traveling to and from [[Ardhmen]].

Gjitha is home to the enormous lighthouse known as the Beacon, located on the water's edgeâ€”an imposing stone tower of some long-dead wizard of old [[Khunan]], repurposed as a navigational aid. A team of [[magewright]]s maintains its [[continual flame]] lamp. Rei Kuaren, the town's sahar, lives and works in the lower floors of the Beacon.
