        "text": "[[Stormreach]] lacks an obvious equivalent to the [[Boromar Clan]] in [[Sharn]]; no single power dominates the underworld here. But just because something’s not obvious doesn’t mean it’s not there. Anyone knowledgable in the dealings of the Stormreach underworld has heard of a cabal hidden in the shadows of the city, a\ncriminal fraternity known as the Quickfoot Gang.\nQuickfoot chooses one member of every significant\ngang or criminal guild to serves as a contact point;\nthis mouthpiece is expected to turn over a share of his\norganization’s profits and to relay messages from the\ngang. As long as the tithes are paid, Quickfoot rarely\ntakes action. However, groups that defy Quickfoot\nare targeted both by criminals and the [[Stormreach Guard]]. It doesn’t take a genius to conclude that the\nleader of Quickfoot—a figure known to members as\nthe ''Spider''—is the [[Storm Lord|Storm Lords]] [[Kirris Sel Shadra]].",
