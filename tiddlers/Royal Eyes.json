Agents spy on other nations, pursue\nnotorious criminals, and engage in a host of other\nwand-and-dagger missions for the crown. \n\nThe Royal Eyes lack the sheer number of sources and boots on the ground that the [[Dark Lanterns|King's Dark Lanterns]] cultivated prior to the outbreak of the [[Last War]]. Stil, they are one of the premier intelligence agencies in [[Khorvaire]].\n\nWhile the Royal Eyes ultimately report to Queen [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]], the day-to-day operations are handled by her spymaster [[Thuel Racannoch]]. The headquarters of the Royal Eyes is the [[Tower of the Eyes]] in [[Fairhaven]].",
