The [[gith]] weren't the only survivors who escaped the universe-shifting destruction of their home world. A small host of [[dragon]]s accompanied the exodus from that doomed reality. But these dragons aren't like the metallic and chromatic dragons of the world that we know.

Gem dragons resemble the [[dragon]]s of the Prime Material Plane physically (albeit with crystalline scales), and they are similarly imbued with magical power, which manifests in their "breath weapons" and spellcasting ability. However, rather than [[arcane magic]], the power of gem dragons is [[psionic|psionics]] in nature. 

Gem dragons also do not sleep, but rather enter a semiconscious trance, as [[elves|elf]] do. While in this trance, these dragons can project their consciousness into the telepathic collective known as ''Sardior''—or at least they could, before the destruction of their home world.

!! The Dream of Siberys

The [[Progenitor Dragons]] are the mythical "prime movers" across all versions of the Material Plane. They created the planar structure of reality, and the Material Plane is the end result of their labors. The Eberron of the [[gith]] started with the same primordial struggle. In the current world, the [[dragon]]s are said to have formed when [[Siberys]]’s blood fell onto [[Eberron]]. In the [[gith]]'s Material Plane, [[Khyber]] didn’t tear apart Siberys’s body; she shattered his mind. The gem dragons believed that fragments of Siberys’s consciousness were scattered through reality, and they sought to reunite these shards; just as [[arcane magic]] is said to be the //blood of Siberys// in the current Eberron, in the [[gith]]'s Eberron, [[psionic energy|psionics]] is called the //dream of Siberys//.

Where the [[dragon]]s of the current [[Eberron]] are concentrated in [[Argonnessen]], the dragons of the [[gith]]'s Eberron were spread across their world. However, they were culturally connected through a telepathic construct—a vast [[metaconcert]], which they believed was a step toward reuniting the shattered [[Siberys]]. They called this psychic nation ''Sardior''. 

Today the survivors yearn to recreate Sardior, and each gem dragon carries their own piece of it within their mind, but there just aren’t enough of them to sustain a global (let alone extraplanar) [[metaconcert]]. Two gem dragons in the same place might be able to link their minds when they trance, to dwell together in a sliver of Sardior. But to truly restore the dream of Siberys, they need more gem dragons.

!! Gem Dragon Reproduction

In the current iteration of [[Eberron]], [[dragon]]s reproduce as other creatures do. But the gem dragons of Sardior are produced in a more mystical way—they are the transcendent forms of other denizens of the [[gith]]'s Eberron. When non-dragons (most often [[humanoid]]s) reach a state of profound enlightenment, their bodies may transform into gem dragon eggs when they die, a process they understand to be a transition to a higher state of existence. 

This means that gem dragons have a fundamentally different relationship with [[humanoid]]s than do the dragons of [[Argonnessen]]. In the current [[Eberron]], dragons see humanoids much like mice—useful for experiments, but don't lose sleep if you have to exterminate a clutch of them. By contrast, in the [[gith]]'s Eberron, dragons all evolved from humanoids, meaning both that they have memories of their humanoid existence and that they rely on humanoids to propagate their species. This is one of the key reasons they work with the [[gith]], even if they might not always agree with their actions: as the last humanoid survivors of their world, gith may be the only species capable of producing new gem dragons.

The full process of enlightenment and metamorphosis is not well understood even by the dragons, but a few key requirements are known. First, it requires at least a moderate degree of [[psionic|psionics]] aptitude. The dragons see psionic energy as the dream of [[Siberys]], and to become a dragon, a humanoid needs to draw this essence into themselves, becoming a refined shard of the mind of the Progenitor. Second, the humanoid must unlock their full potential, becoming the best version of themselves they can be. This is the work of a lifetime, and equivalent in difficulty to unlocking the Divinity Within in the [[Blood of Vol]], or becoming worthy of ascension to the [[Undying Court]] in [[Aerenal]]. The enlightened humanoid then can hope to transform into the egg of a gem dragon after they die.

What type of gem dragon a humanoid may become reflects the path they walked in life. [[Sapphire dragon|sapphire dragon]]s are warlike because they were warriors in their first lives. [[Amethyst dragon|amethyst dragon]]s were planar scholars devoted to fighting [[aberration]]s. Some of the original life's memories and skills are lost in the process of draconic ascension, but the //essence// of that first life remains and guides the dragon from wyrmling to adult—the wisdom, determination, and experience of a life well lived.

!! Gem Dragons in the World

Less than a hundred dragons of Sardior exist in the current reality. They include a single [[greatwyrm]]—an [[amethyst dragon]] who played a crucial role in helping the [[gith]] escape their doomed reality, and generally resides at [[Tu'narath]] in the [[Astral Sea]]. Gem dragons generally work with the [[gith]], but there are a number of other ways that adventurers could encounter a gem dragon in Eberron.

* ''The Mentor.'' These gem dragons study the [[humanoid]]s of this reality. Some merely observe, while others try to guide humanoids towards draconic ascension; a mentor could be found training humanoids in the [[psionic arts|psionics]]. Another mentor might take a direct interest in the depredations of the [[daelkyr]] in this world, secretly working with the [[Gatekeepers]] or the [[Mror|Mror Holds]] dwarves and directly fighting the influence of [[Xoriat]].
* ''The Draconic Observer.'' These gem dragons are studying the native [[dragon]]s of Eberron. They seek to understand the ways of [[Argonnessen]] and to see if the metallic and chromatic dragons could become part of Sardior—not unlike the concept of modern [[goblinoid]]s accessing the [[Dream of the Empire|Uul Dhakaan]].
* ''The Hedonist.'' Some gem dragons have no desire or hope to rebuild Sardior, and instead choose to enjoy the life that they have and pursue whatever it is that brings them joy. A gem dragon could be found in isolation, gathering a hoard and enjoying simple pleasures. Another could perhaps be living as a [[Aurum]] concordian in humanoid form!

!!! Gem Dragons and Argonnessen

The dragons of [[Argonnessen]] are aware of the existence of gem dragons, but see them as fluke occurrences, perhaps draconic versions of [[tiefling]]s or [[aasimar]]s. They haven't yet realized that the remnants of an entire gem dragon civilization are active in the world. This gives player characters the opportunity to have a front row seat for the first full and open contact between Sardior and Argonnessen. Will the [[Conclave]] work with these alien dragons, or seek to eliminate them? How do gem dragons interact with the influence of the [[Daughter of Khyber|Tiamat]]? Do they connect with the [[Draconic Prophecy]] in any way? These questions can be answered over the course of a campaign.
