In Rhiavhaar, you might...

* Help [[Unchained]] dissidents escape the [[Thousand Eyes]] of [[Riedra]].
* Find an ancient artifact tied to the legendary [[Lhazaar]].
* Search for an ancient treasure trove hidden in the height of Rhiavhaar’s power.
* Deal with an [[archfey]] whose defining story has been long forgotten.

Before the [[Sundering]], the coastal nation of Rhiavhaar was the homeland of
[[Lhazaar]], the "explorer" who paved the way for the human
settlement of [[Khorvaire]]. The sailors of Rhiavhaar often
took to slaving and piracy, and Rhiavhaarian ships were
feared throughout the [[Sea of Rage]]. Today this region is the
westernmost outpost of [[Riedra]], and authorized trade with
[[Q'barra]] and the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] passes through
the old Rhiavhaar port of [[Dar Ulatesh]]. Rhiavhaar is an
important hub for the Riedran navy—known as the [[Harmonious Sail]]—and a gateway to Khorvaire, so significant military forces are deployed here. The [[Thousand Eyes]] are
especially active in this region.

The province of Rhiavhaar includes the [[Aventus Islands]], which serve as a staging area for the Harmonious Sail. These islands hold ruins of the lost [[aventi]] nation,
but the [[Riedrans]] shun these areas.

Although the province seems to be under the thumb
of the [[Inspired]], having a high concentration of spies and
secret police, the Rhiavhaarians aren't as devoted as the
[[Ghirvagura]]ns. A variety of dissidents hide here. The tools of the [[Inspired]], such as [[dreamshaping]] and the remote viewing of the [[Thousand Eyes]], are unreliable in areas with [[wild zone]]s to [[Thelanis]]. Thus, cells of dissident groups such as the [[Broken Throne]] or the [[Unchained]] often meet in [[fey]] woods or circles of stones, trusting the ancient powers to shield them.

The [[Inspired]] and the [[Edgewalkers]] have been largely successful in containing the influence of the [[archfey]] associated with the [[wild zone]]s connecting Rhiavhaar to [[Thelanis]]. However, this is a point of frustration for these [[fey]], many of who yearn to see their stories told once more and who want revenge against the Inspired who have humiliated them. This could drive an adventure—as the player characters could enter [[Riedra]] through [[Thelanis]]—or just be a source of unexpected assistance.

!! The Old Kingdom

Rhiavhaar has [[wild zone]]s tied to [[Lamannia]], [[Thelanis]], and [[Shavarath]], and the influence of all three [[plane]]s can be seen in its history. The people of Rhiavhaar have always been the finest shipwrights and sailors of [[Sarlona]]. In part this is due to unusual lumber harvested from [[Lamannia]] wild zones; Rhiavhaaran ships have always been faster and more durable than their counterparts in other nations. Beyond this, Rhiavhaaran sailors have long known tricks for finding favor with wind and water. Some of these were tied to Lamannia and a limited form of [[primal magic]]. Others were tied to bargains with the [[fey]] of [[Thelanis]], whether the friendship of a minor mischievous [[sprite]] or a pact made with an [[archfey]]. But the Rhiavhaarans weren't simply merchants or fisherfolk. The influence of [[Shavarath]] has long driven them to piracy and reaving, and anyone who lived on the Sarlonan coast dreaded the sight of Rhiavhaaran sails.

Alliances with the [[fey]] were a crucial part of Rhiavhaar's culture. It was the fey-favored families who rose to power, and feuds between [[archfey]] often played out in Rhivahaar. While many of the champions of Rhivahaar could be considered to be archfey [[warlock]]s, this tradition wasn't as well developed or understood as it was in [[Ohr Kaluun]]; Rhiavhaaran warlocks generally stumbled into their pacts and only a few wielded significant [[arcane power|arcane magic]]. The Rhiavhaarans valued their connections to their "cousins," but they placed much of their faith in strength and steel. As a result, much of the benefits Rhiavhaarans received from the fey were closely tied to location—and as such, were largely lost when Rhiavhaarans crossed the seas to [[Khorvaire]].

In general, Rhiavhaarans were seen as wild, capricious, and dangerous. "Rhiavhaaran luck" was a curse suggesting that fortune favors a scoundrel.

!!! The Fall of Rhiavhaar

While it was never as despised as [[Ohr Kaluun]], Rhiavhaar was never loved by the people of [[Sarlona]]. Internally, the [[Dreaming Dark]] exacerbated the feuds between clans. Externally, they fanned the flames of those who desired vengeance for generations of Rhiavhaaran reaving, and further convinced people that the Rhiavhaaran "cousins" were [[fiend]]s, not [[fey]].
