        "text": "House [[Cannith]] played a major role in the development of [[Sharn]], and as the\ntowers of the city rose up into the sky, the Lords of\nCannith sunk their roots into the ground. The [[enclave|Cannith Enclave (Dragon Towers)]]\nin [[Dragon Towers]] is used for trade negotiations and\ndiplomatic purposes, but the Forgehold is the heart of\nHouse Cannith. This subterranean fortress includes\na wide range of forges, alchemical workshops, and\nmystical facilities. It is an [[artificer]]'s dream, and\n[[Merrix d'Cannith]] spends most of his time there.\n\nThe Forgehold has many secrets. The first is a\nshrine to the [[Traveler]], who was revered by the early\n[[Cannith]] tinkers. The greatest secret is hidden even\nfrom other members of the house. In an ancient\nchamber hidden behind [[illusion]]s and arcane seals,\nMerrix has preserved one of the [[creation forge]]s used to\nproduce the [[warforged]]. This chamber is largely operated by warforged, although Merrix has confided in a few of his closest associates.\n\nThe Forgehold is one of the finest fortresses built\nby the House of Making. It is designed to withstand both\nmagical and physical assaults, and a thief or spy must\novercome a wide range of deadly traps to even approach\nits secrets. A force of warforged soldiers and [[Sharn]]'s five\nmembers of the [[Darkwood Watch]], the elite [[wandslinger]]s of House Cannith, protect the place. The existence of the [[creation forge]] is a terrible secretâ€”but not one that is\nlikely to be revealed any time in the near future. ",
