Desh Anarn is a fallen champion of the [[Blood of Vol]] returned as a sentient skeletal guardian, who now serves the [[Old Bones]] gang of veteran [[Karrnath]]i soldiers in [[Graywall]]. The circumstances that allowed Anarn to return with such power remain
a mystery; this could be due to his great faith in the Blood of Vol, or he could be a creation of [[Lady Illmarrow]]â€”a spy sent to watch this splinter group to see if it can be used.
