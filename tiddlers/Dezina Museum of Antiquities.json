Its\ncollection would be even more impressive were it\nnot for the strong tendency the University has to sell\nvaluable artifacts rather than put them on display,\nnot to mention the steady stream of items routinely\nstolen from the museum. More interesting (at least\nto some) than the museum's displayed collection are\nits vaults, vast rooms below the publicly accessible\nareas of the museum that contain unopened crates\nof treasures waiting to be cataloged, shelves of artifacts deemed uninteresting, and a few secret rooms holding items too important or dangerous to put on\npublic display.
