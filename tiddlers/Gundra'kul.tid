Gundra'kul, known as simply "the Obsidian City" by the few [[Khorvairians|Khorvaire]] aware of its existence, is an ancient outpost of the [[Sulat League]] which has been transformed into a [[drow]] citadel. Located in the [[Skyfall Peninsula]] about 700 miles up the [[Koronoo River]] from [[Stormreach]], Gundra'kul is the headquarters of the militant faction of [[Sulatu]] drow known as the [[Army of Promise]] (//Usé Axwuc// in [[Shedani]]). In the [[surrounding forest|Sul'asa]] of blazing hues, [[firesled]]s patrol the region scouting for intruders—and the Promise Soldiers tend to [[fireball]] first and ask questions later. 

Within the fortress, more patrols and even tamed [[chimera]]s maintain security. But the [[Army of Promise]] under the command of Flamespeaker [[Holua Xiv'inn]] maintain a surprisingly jovial barracks atmosphere. For them, this is a place where they can unwind and laugh together. But for the peoples of the surrounding region, Gundra'kul is a blight on the land that symbolizes destruction and grief at the hands of callous killers. 

!! Fortress Structure

The fortress of Gundra'kul itself is classic [[Sulat|Sulat League]] design—a four-sided star fort formed out of a solid mass of [[blood glass]], a kind of obsidian which is melded with crimson Khyber [[dragonshard]]s. These allowed the ancient ancestors of the [[fire giant]]s to bind [[fire elemental]]s within the walls of the fort. [[Forgebinder|Forgebinders]] techniques allow the [[Sulatu]] to command these elementals to melt and reshape the blood glass, which has allowed them to transform the [[giant]] fortress into a citadel suited for [[drow]]-sized creatures. In case of attack, the drow simply fuse the gates of the city shut.

The [[Army of Promise]] dwells in the old living quarters of the [[giant]]s, reshaped over the years to have partitions and interior walls. The Obsidian City is home to the bulk of non-combatant Promise Soldiers, and adventurers who breach the walls can expect to find both gung-ho youths eager for new victims for their bloodthirsty prank-wars, and disaffected ones who would do anything to get out of the jingoistic cauldron. The fortress design originally included workshop facilities for elven slaves during the last days of the [[Age of Giants]], and the [[Sulatu]] have made heavy use of the leftover tools for their own purposes—largely, supplying the [[Army|Army of Promise]] with armor and weapons, but also unlocking more of the secrets of the [[Sulat League]].

While the structure of the fortress has been considerably changed over the years, the spacious courtyard in the center has remained the same since the day the [[League|Sulat League]] fell. A huge pillar of basalt sits in its heart, upon which sits a glaring statue of a titan. A secret doorway within the pillar leads down into a mysterious chamber beneath the courtyard; [[divination]]s have confirmed the existence of an ancient laboratory at the opposite end of the chamber, protected by a [[private sanctum]] effect. But to reach it, one must pass through a deadly "ash maze"—a terrifying defense mechanism of [[Sulat League]] fortresses. Walls of intense heat manifest as a subtle rippling in the air, but are otherwise invisible; anything that passes through these barriers is instantly incinerated. Even worse, this maze seems to detect motion, and shifts the walls of heat in response, forming concentric rings of sudden death.

No one has yet successfully traversed the maze or otherwise bypassed the ancient security measure. But Flamespeaker [[Holua|Holua Xiv'inn]] believes a world-changing secret lies within that guarded laboratory. He also believes that only a champion chosen by prophecy can successfully make it through... but is more than willing to throw captured adventurers into the grinder.
