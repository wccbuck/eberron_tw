        "text": "Dorius Alyre ir'Korran was a [[gnome]] loremaster of the powerful Korran family in [[Zilargo]] some 3000 years ago. A member of the [[Church of the Wyrm Ascendant]], he was obsessed with the theory that\nthe deities of the [[Sovereign Host]] were in fact ascended\n[[dragon]]s, and believed that he himself could amass enough knowledge and information\nto surpass even the Sovereign Lord [[Aureon]] and thereby ascend and take the god’s place. The Korran family invested considerable wealth in Dorius’s obsession; even\nthose who didn’t believe his theories of divinity were\nintrigued by the idea of a vast vault for knowledge. Thus, the [[Library of Korranberg]] was founded.\n\nDorius ir'Korran was also the primary author of the celebrated Planar Codex, the foremost publication on the nature of the [[plane]]s of existence.",
