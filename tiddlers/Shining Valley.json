A secret tunnel leads through a series of caverns to a small cave on the [[Droaam]] side of the mountain range.\n\nWhen the Haunting Song, a flight of [[harpies|harpy]] living in Droaam, refused to bow to the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]], the Carrion Callers and [[Stormsingers]] harpies combined forces to make an example of them. Decimated, the survivors fled into the mountain caves and eventually discovered Shining Valley. Tending their wounded, they quickly discovered the curative properties of the [[Irian]] [[manifest zone]]. The flight has remained in the valley ever since. The flight bides its time, raising a new generation in the valleyâ€™s endless light and planning for the day when the Haunting Song will have revenge on the Daughters of Sora Kell and their treacherous kin.",
