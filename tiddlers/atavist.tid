Most followers of the [[Path of Light]] believe that darkness must be fought with light, that the turning of the age (see <<navAndScrollToHeader "Dal Quor" "The Turning of the Age">> of [[Dal Quor]]) must be achieved through meditation and strengthening of one's own spirit, and that the only way to defeat evil is to redeem it. The faith has followed this path for over a thousand years, but now a splinter sect advocates greater action. These atavist "shadow watchers" believe that evil must be fought directly, that sources of darkness that poison communities can and should be ruthlessly eliminated.

The path of atavism was developed in [[Khorvaire]] over
the course of the last century, but its power is drawn
from the very foundation of the [[kalashtar]] race. The
[[quori]] spirits that gave birth to the kalashtar are spread
throughout their descendants, existing now as little
more than a memory. The discipline of an atavist
strengthens their bond to this ancestral spirit and to
all other kalashtar that have embraced their unique
heritage. When working alone, atavists can be versatile
and dangerous opponents; when acting in concert, they
become an unstoppable force.

The first steps on the path of the atavist are an intense experience
requiring considerable mental discipline. Aspirants are broken into
groups based on spiritual lineage. They undergo harsh training designed to break
down the walls they have built around their personalities, eventually opening their minds
to contact with other [[kalashtar]] of their line. The process can be physically deadly or result in permanent psychological damage, but the
''Serath'' (the dominant lineage, led by the mystic Soserath) see the atavists as the army of the kalashtar and allow no room for weakness or coddling.

As an atavist advances in level, they strengthen the
bond with their [[quori]] spirit. This bond gives them an
intuitive connection to other [[kalashtar]] who share
the same lineage, and they gain a range of abilities that
allows them to share their knowledge, power, and
skills with their spiritual kin.

!! Playing an Atavist

You perceive a world that those around you cannot see.
Always listening to the whispered thoughts of your
brothers and sisters, you half-dream of battles you’ve
never fought and places you’ve never been. Though
non-[[kalashtar]] often see your gift as madness, you
draw your strength from this world, allowing these
whispers to guide you in battle and strengthen your
mind. When you summon up forgotten knowledge or your defensive insight allows you to survive an attack, give thanks to your spiritual advisers. When you sense suspicious behavior in another person, attribute that insight to your [[quori]] spirit or an absent friend, and remember that you are never alone.

In addition, look at the dominant trait of your spiritual lineage and act accordingly. If you are aggressive, you might have trouble standing in one place for more
than a few minutes. If you are insightful, you might be
prone to long lectures. You are not manically devoted to
this single trait, but it should certainly be the driving
force behind your personality.
