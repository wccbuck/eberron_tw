''Population:'' <<ntls>>

Positioned along the [[Thrane River]] near its source,
Sigilstar marks the convergence of three caravan
routes and a [[lightning rail]] line. With all these trade
arteries, Sigilstar has emerged as a serious competitor to the commercial centers of [[Aruldusk]] and [[Flamekeep]].

Part of Sigilstar’s appeal stems from its cosmopolitan atmosphere. It is home to the largest population of [[wizard]]s in the entire nation, and its people hold
a broader view of religion’s place in society. Sigilstar takes its name from a fixed star in the heavens around which all other stars seem to wheel—much
the same way the residents of the city see themselves.

Sigilstar has been a major hub of the [[Black Highway]] smuggling network for almost 80 years. Its local operations are coordinated by the [[White Hand Guild]].
