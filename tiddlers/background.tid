This tag is used for [[talent]]s associated with a specific background or profession, typically describing the life your character led before becoming an adventurer. These talents are intended to help guide your decisions during [[character creation|Character Creation]], but are not required. It's okay not to take the [[Sailor]] talent even if your character was a sailor for many years. Also, other talents you take which don't have the "background" tag obviously may still be narratively linked to your character's previous occupation.
