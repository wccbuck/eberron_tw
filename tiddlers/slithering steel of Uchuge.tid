title: slithering steel of Uchuge
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This twisted and serrated blade was once wielded by one of the champions of Uchuge, a mysterious arch[[fiend]] of the [[Age of Demons]] also referred to as "the Squirm". The blade always seems to be in motion when held. It shifts to wrap around, trap, and even break any weapons that attack the wielder.
