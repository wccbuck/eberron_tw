This iron token is inlaid with a sliver of a Siberys [[dragonshard]].
Most are worn as brooches, but others take the form of coins or
keys. While an uul'kur (dream key) is a common magic item, the secret of
their creation is known only to the chot'uul monks of the [[Heirs of Dhakaan]], and they are largely unknown in the [[Five Nations]].

When you sleep with an uul'kur on your person, you remain
fully lucid when you dream, and when you wake, you clearly
remember everything that transpired. If you understand the
workings of the uul'kur, you can choose to bind it to your
dreams until dawn the next day. While bound, any creature who
sleeps with this token on its person shares your dream instead
of creating its own, provided you are asleep at the same time.
