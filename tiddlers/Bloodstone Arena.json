        "text": "The people of [[Droaam]] love their blood sports, and battles take place in the [[Graywall]] arena every night. Combats include formal grudge matches, open melees, bounty battles with fierce beasts or condemned criminals, and trials for the soldiers of\nthe [[Flayer Guard]]. One popular form of bounty battle\nis [[six stones]]: seven challengers enter the ring with one or more [[basilisk]]s, and only one walks out, leaving six \"stones\" behind.\n\nPCs who wish to fight in the arena can seek a sponsor who can get them into the ring for a share of the purse. The two likely sponsors are Kelâ€™Aashta, a [[Tharashk]] [[orc]] who monitors the arena for possible mercenary recruits; and Fela Fingerbones, a clever [[goblin]] whose family has been spreading its roots into gambling activities across [[Graywall]].",
