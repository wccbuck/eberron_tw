//[[Dwarves|dwarf]] are stoic. [[Elves|elf]] are wise. [[Gnomes|gnome]] are cunning. And humans? They can't make up their mind, so they try to be all of these things at once.//

The first human settlers came to [[Khorvaire]] from [[Sarlona]] about
3,000 years ago, landing in the area now known as the
[[Lhazaar Principalities]]. From there, they began a slow
but inexorable spread across the continent, disrupting
the placid elven empire of [[Aerenal]] and leaving further
ruined remnants of fallen [[Dhakaan]]i [[goblinoid]] kingdoms
in their wake. During this migration, they founded the
settlements that would grow into the [[Five Nations]]. Even
today humans make up the majority of the population
in these countries. Despite their relatively short lifespans—or perhaps because of them—humans are innovative, adaptable, and aggressive, always pushing their
limits and pursuing new ideas.

Humans prove extremely diverse; a [[barbarian]] from
the [[Demon Wastes]] has little in common with a [[Brelish|Breland]]
[[rogue]]. When creating a human character, consider
where you're from and how that's reflected in your class
and [[background]]. [[Aundair]] is a logical place of origin for a
[[wizard]] character, but your wizard could be a down-and-out arcanist from the alleys of [[Sharn]] or a [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] pirate
with a knack for the mystic arts.

If you want to jump-start your ideas for a human character's origins, you can roll on the table below.

| !<<dr d10>> |!Origin |
| 1 |An impoverished [[wizard]] from [[Aundair]], striving to prove you're as intelligent as any other Aundairian |
| 2 |A streetwise [[rogue]] from [[Breland]] who wants nothing more than to escape the bustle of [[Sharn]] forever |
| 3 |A displaced Cyran veteran who was engaged in war outside [[Cyre]] at the time of the [[Mourning]] and is now stranded with no home |
| 4 |A [[barbarian]] from the [[Demon Wastes]] who repented from a life of cruelty and hopes to atone for past evils |
| 5 |A kindly [[druid]] from the [[Eldeen Reaches]] who wants to learn about the flora and fauna of the rest of [[Khorvaire]] and beyond |
| 6 |A [[cleric]] from [[Karrnath]] who aspires to learn the arts of [[necromancy]]—for the noblest aims, of course]] |
| 7 |A piratical [[bard]] from the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] who loves sea shanties but also wants to immortalize the deeds of great heroes in song |
| 8 |A [[ranger]] trained to hunt the jungles of [[Q'barra]] who harbors a grudge against [[dragon]]s |
| 9 |A [[warlock]] from the [[Shadow Marches]], teetering on the edge of sanity while contemplating the [[daelkyr]] |
| 10 |A [[Thrane]] [[paladin]] of the [[Silver Flame]] who's looking for something to prove the truth underpinning belief |

!! Humans and Dragonmarks

Five different [[dragonmark]]s appear among humans,
reflecting their dominant status among the races of
[[Khorvaire]]:

* The [[Mark of Making]] is found in House [[Cannith]], which has used it to become one of the most powerful houses, creating an abundance of both magical and technological wonders.
* The [[Mark of Passage]] aids the humans of House [[Orien]] in operating the lightning rail and trade caravans running across the continent.
* The [[Mark of Sentinel]] makes the bodyguards, mercenaries, and [[Sentinel Marshals]] of House [[Deneith]] widely respected across [[Khorvaire]].
* The [[Mark of Handling]] appears in House [[Vadalis]], which uses it to breed fine mounts and other creatures.
* Humans also number among House [[Tharashk]] and manifest the [[Mark of Finding]] with their [[half-orc]] kin, though they need to have at least some [[orc]] blood in their ancestry.
