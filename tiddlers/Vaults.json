House\n[[Kundarak]] offers storage space for small- to medium-sized items of great value with the highest possible\nsecurity, at a cost of [[1c|money]] per month (which includes\ninsurance against theft). These are for long-term\nstorage, not for short-term like the safe-deposit vaults, and thus can't\nbe collected magically from other sites.",
