In the central pavilion, sacrifices offered in major festivals and on important holy\ndays honor the pantheon as a whole. The ranking\npriest in Sharn, High Priest [[Phthaso Mogan]], leads most of these rituals and\nsacrifices. Homes for the many clergy working here\noccupy several tower levels below the Pavilion. ",
