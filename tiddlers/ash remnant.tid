Ash remnants are undead entities that haunt the borders of the [[Mournland]], both within the [[dead-gray mists]] and many miles inland. They are the last vestiges of those who failed to escape the wall of mist on the Day of [[Mourning]]. A remnant's vaguely human form, with gaunt arms and a gaping mouth, is formed of the barren ash that covers much of the ground of the Mournland. Its eyes burn with a sickly green fire, and its claws erupt in similar noxious flame when it strikes. Some believe they are animated by raw hatred and despair, constantly reliving the terror of the [[Mourning]] in the shattered remnants of their minds.

Ash remnants lie in wait just beneath the surface of the ground, burrowing up to attack creatures who pass above it. They fight with little intelligence, simply attacking the nearest creature. However, their attacks are deadly, and their movements are strange and unpredictable. Hiding from remnants is also difficult, as they seem to possess a form of [[blindsight]]. Ash remnants have also been known to cling to a creature and gaze into the victims eyes, dazing them with an overwhelming feeling of despair; survivors have described the experience as seeing a distillation of all the pain and misery that fills the [[Mournland]].
