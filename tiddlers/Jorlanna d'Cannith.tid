Jorlanna d'Cannith is the leader of House [[Cannith]]'s [[west faction|Cannith West]]. The daughter of [[Starrin d'Cannith]]’s second wife, Elsabet, Jorlanna takes a diplomatic
approach to the struggle for control of the [[dragonmarked house]].
[[Merrix|Merrix d'Cannith]] promises new creations; Jorlanna promises
better relations with the [[Five Nations]] and the other
[[dragonmarked house]]s. Her detractors say those
better relations are exactly the problem. In her youth,
Jorlanna fell in love with an heir of House [[Deneith]]
and might have borne a child. (Marriage and interbreeding between members of different houses has been forbidden since after the [[War of the Mark]], due to a belief it results in children with [[aberrant dragonmark]]s.)
Many scorn her for that romance, and find her too
accommodating of the other houses.

Both [[Zorlan|Zorlan d'Cannith]] and [[Merrix|Merrix d'Cannith]] remain unaware
that Jorlanna’s romantic indiscretions are
not entirely behind her. For a year now,
Jorlanna has been clandestinely involved with a young scion of House [[Orien]]—never realizing that her lover is actually a [[rakshasa]] agent of the [[Lords of Dust]]. The [[fiend]]’s immediate goal is to fracture House Cannith permanently, and he manipulates
Jorlanna to that end. The number of [[dragonmarked house]]s holds relevance to the [[Draconic Prophecy]], and if the number were to increase to 14 or 15, it's possible that could unlock a stanza in the prophecy that could lead to the release of an [[overlord]].
