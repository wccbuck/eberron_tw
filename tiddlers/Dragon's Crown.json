{"created": "20210131034811375", "title": "Dragon's Crown", "text": "A ring of jutting stones rises from the earth within the heart of [[Breland]]\u2019s farm country.\nThe ring consists of ten stone monoliths, each more than fifteen feet high, that sit slightly askew in a circle around a patch of uneven ground some thirty feet across. The ring\nof stones resembles a massive crown of jagged rock. Known\nfar and wide as the Dragon\u2019s Crown, the place has long\nbeen the subject of speculation, outlandish legends, and\nthe occasional dark ritual. Some believe that [[giant]] hands\nbuilt the Dragon\u2019s Crown in [[ages|Age of Giants]] past.\n\nNothing much grows within or near the Crown. On\nsome nights, especially when one or more [[moon]] is full\nand bright, the monoliths glow with an eerie inner light.\nIt is said that on these nights, the monoliths sing, but\nnot many are willing to visit the site after dark to prove\nthis tale one way or another. It is also said that cultists\nuse the site to conduct dark rituals, especially members\nof the various sects devoted to the [[Dragon Below|Cults of the Dragon Below]]; except\nfor the occasional carcass discovered lying in the center\nof the Crown, no evidence of such activities has ever\nbeen gathered.", "modified": "20210727192005329", "tags": "Breland monument", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "article": "the ", "category": "location", "color": "#3B5C0A", "points": "32.511,-6.71", "style": "{\"color\": \"#732873\"}"}
