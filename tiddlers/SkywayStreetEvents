1: A few [[gargoyle]]s perch on a mansion's walls. They're seemingly there for security, but they offer lively commentary about everyone who passes by.
2: A noble with auburn hair held in a silver diadem holds a [[darkwood]] staff encrusted with [[dragonshard]]s, and taps it impatiently while waiting for a [[skycoach]].
3: You pass by a hope well. Supposedly, any coins you throw in the well are gathered and transported down to help the troubled people of the [[lower ward]]s.
4: "Make way! Make way!" A boy clears a path for a jewel-encrusted [[warforged]] wearing a lavish fur cloak.
5: You come upon a fountain of cold fire. In the center, a brass dragon spits brilliant flames into the air, and they spill down and out into the surrounding pool.
6: A team of handlers from House [[Vadalis]] walk alongside a small [[gelatinous cube]]. "We're trying it out, seeing if it can help keep things clean," they say.
7: A [[magewright]] offers to use a simple charm to polish the coins in your purse for a negligible fee. "We wouldn't want anyone here to get grime on their gloves from handling those filthy coins of yours from the [[lower ward]]s."
8: A tour group pauses to marvel at a mansion.
9: A large statue commemorates Lord Dalian [[ir'Tain|ir'Tain family]], a noble philanthropist lost at sea at the end of the [[Last War]]. He holds a spyglass in one hand and a miniature dragon turtle in the other.
10: A [[warforged]] with roses twined around her limbs offers to sell you a bouquet for five silver sovereigns.
11: It starts to drizzle. A well-dressed [[half-elf]] glares at the sky and snaps his fingers. The rain immediately stops.
12: A member of the [[Sharn Watch]] stops you. "Can I help you? Are you sure you're in the right ward?"
