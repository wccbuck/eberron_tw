Kauverra, a [[copper|copper dragon]] [[rogue dragon]] in [[Khorvaire]], loves her beautiful form. She desires nothing more than to preserve her magnificence and, when possible, improve on it. Several years ago she broke off a fang and used magic to fuse a diamond surrogate in its place. Now she seeks out perfect diamonds, planning to replace all her teeth with the glittering trove.
