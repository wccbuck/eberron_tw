type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must resist the icy wind or suffer cold damage. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

This spell can be upgraded to legendary-[[tier|spell tier]] for an even more destructive effect.
