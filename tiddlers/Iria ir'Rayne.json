        "text": "Iria ir'Rayne is a Provost of [[Arcanix]] and is one of the leading scholars on a phenomena known as the \"Blood of [[Siberys]]\": an ambient magical power imbued within certain gifted individuals. These \"dragonblood [[sorcerer]]s\" might use the techniques and trappings of [[Siberyan|Siberyan Theory]] [[wizard]]ry to harness their power, but they are naturally attuned to specific magical effects, and have enormous potential within this narrow scope. Provost ir'Rayne believes that there may be more people with latent dragonblood talent than has been realized; it’s simply that there’s no widespread method to test for this talent. She founded the [[Children of Siberys]] to do just that, and to study the nature of dragonblood sorcery.",
