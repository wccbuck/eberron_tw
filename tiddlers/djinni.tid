Proud, sensuous [[genie]]s from [[Syrania]], the djinn are attractive, tall, well-muscled elemental humanoids with blue skin and dark eyes. They dress in airy, shimmering silks, designed as much for comfort as to flaunt their musculature. Djinn rule floating islands of cloud stuff in the [[Open Sky]] covered with enormous pavilions, or topped with wondrous buildings, courtyards, fountains, and gardens. Creatures of comfort and ease, djinn enjoy succulent fruits, pungent wines, fine perfumes, and beautiful music.

Masters of the air, the djinn ride powerful whirlwinds that they create and direct on a whim, and which can even carry passengers. Creatures that stand against a djinni are assaulted by wind and thunder, even as the djinni spins away on that wind if outmatched in combat. When a djinni flies, its lower body transforms into a column of swirling air.

Djinn can cast a variety of spells, including: [[detect immortal]], [[detect magic]], [[thunderwave]], [[create food and water]] (they can also create wine), [[tongues]], [[wind walk]], [[conjure elemental]] ([[air elemental]] only), [[creation]], [[gaseous form]], [[invisibility]], [[greater illusion]], and [[plane shift]].

!! Peace and Comfort

The [[plane]] of [[Syrania]] embodies peace, and all that flourishes in times of peace: knowledge, commerce, contemplation. [[Angel|angel]]s perform the tasks necessary to maintain the [[Immeasurable Market]] while [[dominion]]s contemplate the concept of commerce, but angels don’t //enjoy// the luxuries that commerce provides. This is the role of the djinn. The floating towers of the dominions are serene and often austere; above them are the cloud-palaces of the djinn, wondrous spectacles of crystal and stone. Within, the djinn dwell amid glorious opulence, their needs tended by [[unseen servant]]s. In this, they reflect the [[efreet|efreeti]] of [[Fernia]], but the efreet are defined by the hunger of the consuming flame, the endless desire for //more//, while the djinn are more comfortable in their luxury. A djinni may find joy in contemplating a fine work of art, while the efreeti is always concerned that their neighbor has something finer. The djinn are fundamentally more peaceful that the efreet, embodying the wonder of the clouds. While they lack the fiery temper of the efreet, djinn can be as capricious as the wind; intrigue is also a thing that flourishes in times of peace, and they can take joy in matching wits with clever mortals.

The djinn celebrate the fruits of peace, including celebration itself. Djinn regularly hold grand galas in their floating manors; but these focus on the joy of good times with good company as opposed to the ostentatious and competitive displays of the [[efreet|efreeti]]. Nonetheless, a mortal who earns a reputation as an amazing entertainer or artist could potentially be invited to a djinni’s ball.
