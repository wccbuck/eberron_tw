title: Coasthold
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The easternmost portion of [[Stormreach]] is easily the
city’s most unusual subdivision. A massive trench in the
ground once demarcated the eastern border of the old
city and today marks the start of Coasthold, the domain
of House [[Kundarak]]. When the [[dwarves|dwarf]] first arrived
in force, they found no substantive construction to
the north and east of the trench, though they found
nothing wrong with the land itself. It was as though
previous civilizations intentionally chose to stay away
from the plot of land, despite its prime location along
the region’s eastern coast. Sensing opportunity, the
dwarves approached the [[Storm Lords]] with a proposal to
purchase the undeveloped land from the city outright.
With the help of their allies in the [[Amanatu family]], the
deal went through, and House [[Kundarak]] immediately
set to work on the two massive stone bridges that today
link the ward to the rest of [[Silverwall]].

House [[Kundarak]] owns every inch of Coasthold, from the harbor to the south to the [[river|Koronoo River]] mouth in the north. The agreement with the city affords the house a number of perks that other houses cannot claim, chief among them being the right to turn away even the [[Stormreach Guard]] at their gates. Despite this apparent loss of power, the [[Storm Lords]] have all profited from House Kundarak’s presence, and all seem to appreciate the legal loopholes created by having such a reservation in their midst.
