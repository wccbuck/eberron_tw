        "text": "House [[Tharashk]]’s [[dragonshard]] mining operations in [[Q'barra]] are controlled\nby the [[Velderan]] clan. Lord Khalar Velderan is a\ncunning and ruthless man. In his youth he was an\n[[inquisitive]] in [[Sharn]], and he’s comfortable fighting\nwith either words or steel. Khalar is [[human]] with only a touch of [[orc]] blood in his ancestry, but the majority of the [[Tharashk]] forces in the region are [[orc]]s\nor [[half-orc]]s. The house has also brought large numbers of monstrous mercenaries to [[Q'barra]] to serve as laborers and guards. [[Ogre|ogre]]s and [[minotaur]]s are found\nat Tharashk sites, and [[gargoyle]]s and [[harpies|harpy]] serve as\nmessengers and scouts. Repurposed [[warforged titan]]s\nperform the heavy mining operations at the largest\npits. However, there is always room for cheap labor at\na Tharashk mine.\n\nDespite the success he has enjoyed so far, Lord\nKhalar is hungry to expand his operations and\nchafes at the restrictions imposed by King [[Sebastes|Sebastes ir'Kesslan]]. Although he is careful not to endanger the position of his house, he is secretly funding a number of\nteams that are operating in forbidden territory. He\ndoesn’t care if independent miners enjoy limited success, but if a lucky prospector found a remarkably rich deposit, Khalar might try to buy out their claim... and failing that, employ bandits or others to drive the settler from their claim.\n\nThe town of [[Whitecliff]] in [[Hope]], located near the largest [[dragonshard]] mine yet discovered, serves as the base of operations for Khalar's covert schemes, and when Khalar isn't lobbying in [[Newthrone]], he stays there.",
