The royal seat of power of [[Aundair]], Fairhold occupies
a significant amount of real estate in the city of [[Fairhaven]]. Rising above the tallest buildings in the city, Fairhold
is a wonder of architectural achievement, a graceful fusion of style and defense. Behind steep walls
pierced by looming gates rest half a dozen towers and
twice as many minarets.

The King’s Hall, where Queen [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]] holds audience with
the public, is an impressive chamber capable of permitting fifteen hundred people to stand before Aundair’s crown. 

The Royal Collection of Aundair, housed in the south wing of the estate, provides one of the best libraries
available in northern [[Khorvaire]]. The collection includes
records dating back to the founding of [[Galifar]], as well
as a few older documents that come from the days of the
original [[Five Nations]]. The public can view some parts of
the collection, but large sections are only accessible to those
who receive special dispensation. 

The Courts of Justice,
located in the east wing of the estate, handle the various
trials and mediations that require interpretations and
rulings on the law. Fairhold also maintains a museum
dedicated to the crown, displaying relics that examine
the nation’s history—both as an independent country and
when it was part of the [[Galifar]] kingdom.

Fairhold also houses a garrison of the [[Knights Arcane]], as well as the [[Tower of the Eyes]], the headquarters of the [[Royal Eyes]] of Aundair.
