        "text": "All the [[grist]] mills and most of the taverns of [[Bloodstone]] have a [[harpy]]\nsongbird in residence, but these are frequently\nnovices honing their skills. The best of these deadly\nsingers reside at the Venomous Voice, a tavern that\nserves both as a roost for the independent harpies of\n[[Graywall]] and a place for daring patrons to hear\nmusical duels between harpy virtuosos. Entertainment at the Voice also includes storytelling, choral training (used to teach the youngest harpies the basic\nskills), and command performances by the most\ngifted sirens. Many who visit the Voice find themselves braving the dangers of Bloodstone to return to the [[harpy]] tavern, and some jaded tourists travel from\nthe [[Five Nations]] to hear the legendary performances. The Venomous Voice is managed by Zoryanna of the Last Dirge flight, a devotee of the [[Fury]].",
