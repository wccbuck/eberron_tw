        "text": "The interest that House [[Kundarak]] charges for loans is responsible for the lion’s\nshare of the house’s income. Its banks can be found in cities across the [[Five Nations]] and eastern [[Khorvaire]]—all magically warded and watched over by house guards. The Banking Guild regulates commerce in gem cutting and jewelry manufacture, money changing, and moneylending. It also advises (some would say dictates to) national governments about consistent standards for coinage. It works closely with House [[Sivis]] on accounting matters and with House [[Cannith]] on price stability for basic goods.\n\nHouse [[Kundarak]]’s vaults are magically linked across [[Khorvaire]] and even to the city of [[Stormreach]] in [[Xen'drik]]. A customer who rents a safe-deposit vault can access that vault from any Kundarak bank.",
