Drake turtles (or "softshell dragon turtles") are a smaller and less intelligent cousin to the mighty [[dragon turtle]]s. They are found in the [[Lhazaar Sea]] and [[Thunder Sea]]. They reach sizes of well over 25 feet long, and at least one 40-foot specimen has been reported.

!! Drake Turtles in the Lhazaar Sea

Drake turtle hunting is a major part of the [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] economy. Drake blood is a crucial component in industrial [[alchemy|alchemist]], part of what allows [[Jorasco]] and [[Cannith]] to produce mass quantities of [[healing potion|potion of healing]]s and other elixirs. Drakebone is used in everything from corsets to weaponry. In the Principalities, most medium armor makes use of drake turtle scales and heavy armor is typically made not from metal, but from drake turtle shells. 

While it is true that drake turtles don't appear to be sapient (they don't speak [[Common]] or [[Draconic]], they don't perform magic), they do sing a haunting song… and anyone who knows the language (which very few land-dwellers do) will realize that they are singing in [[Aquan|Primordial]].

It's up to the GM and the players what this means. A [[druid]] adventurer may realize a drake turtle is singing in Aquan, but that doesn't prove that the drake is actually intelligent by the typical measures. Even if adventurers can prove it, they would need to convince the [[Principalities|Lhazaar Principalities]] to make a change. Principalities could be split, with some princes forbidding drake hunting, while other principalities are deeply dependent on the drake-hunting economy. It could be that ending drake hunting would be a major blow to industrial alchemy, unless [[Cannith]] and [[Jorasco]] can be pushed to find new methods of production. Ultimately, it’s a more dramatic and bloodier version of the ethical questions of [[elemental binding]]—and it could be that fighting over this issue could force people to reevaluate [[Zil|Zilargo]] binding as well.

!! Drake Turtles in the Thunder Sea

In the [[Eternal Dominion]], the [[sahuagin]] subjugate drake turtles and force them to serve as beasts of burden and living engines of war. The Dominion has even been known to embed [[siege staff]]s into drake turtle shells.

Many [[Karakala]] [[merfolk]] pods bond with a [[drake turtle]], which serves as the
locus of the pod; the merfolk strap themselves to the turtle
when they sleep. Unlike the drake turtles of the [[Eternal Dominion]], this is a symbiotic relationship; the merfolk help their companion find food and keep the drake entertained.
