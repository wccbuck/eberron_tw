Holy Uldra is the //lath// of a small [[halfling]] tribe, but her powers of oratory and persuasion have made her one of the most important leaders in the [[Talenta Plains]]. 

Characters who meet the young priest are hard-pressed to guess that she is the single
most powerful religious figure in the Plains. Holy Uldra speaks of herself as a simple [[cleric]], but she makes no attempt to hide the devoted following she
has acquired. Although she does not covet power for
her own gain, she is deadly earnest in her belief that
the path she espouses is the best one for her people.

Holy Uldra believes that the mere act of creating a nation encompassing the Talenta Plains is an affront to [[halfling]] culture and the will of [[Balinor]]. Land is a gift of the gods, and to claim ownership over it is a senseless desecration of the kind practiced
by [[human]]s and other races. She believes that if these new ways are allowed to continue, emotional bankruptcy and spiritual genocide can be the only results.

Uldra's contempt for House [[Ghallanda]], House [[Jorasco]], and [[Lathon Halpum]] is well known, as is her belief that the actions of the [[halfling]] [[house|dragonmarked house]]s and the tribal council threaten to debase the Plainsâ€™ traditional culture and the spiritual core of halfling life. Her often strident followers share these beliefs. While she gives her followers no specific mandate or orders, militant halfling tribes have used her teachings as motivation for attacks against the [[dragonmarked house]]s and even the tribal council.
