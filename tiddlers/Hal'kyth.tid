type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The [[Eternal Dominion]] city of Hal'kyth is built on and around the [[kar'lassa]] tied to the [[plane]] of [[Kythri]]. The influence of the Churning Chaos supports magic tied to change and [[transmutation]], and these are vital to the society of the Dominion. Hal’kyth is the heart of the [[alchemical|alchemist]] industry. While all great [[sahuagin]] cities harvest the blood of the [[kar'lassa]], it is Hal’kyth that has the greatest capacity for refining it. Though the Dominion is slow to innovate, the [[artificer]]s of Hal’kyth are an exception, and they
continue to develop new techniques; the [[plasmid]]s were first [[magebred|magebreeding]] in Hal’kyth, as were the living [[siege staff]]s colloquially known as "slugs."
