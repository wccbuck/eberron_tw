It is said that creatures who look into this pool can see visions of the past, present, and future, and that the waters are\nattuned to the most significant events in [[Eberron]].\n\nNobles, merchants, and ambitious\nadventurers have sought out the Pond of Shadows,\nand the PCs might be hired on as guides for such an\nexpedition. Alternatively, the pond might reveal a\nsecret important to one of the PCsâ€”or show a possible\nfuture that must be prevented at any cost.",
