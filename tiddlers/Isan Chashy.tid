Isan Chashy owns and operates [[Isan's Extrinsic Emporium]], located in [[Lyrandar Tower]] in [[Sharn]]. He is an older man with a ring of wispy white hairs that seem to fly in a hundred different directions at once surrounding his mostly bald head. A former adventurer himself, he is always happy to hear tales of his customers' expeditions.
