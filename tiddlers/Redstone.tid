''First Impression:'' Handsome towers of red marble

and silver.<br/>

One of the newer districts, Redstone is less than
two hundred years old and many of the respectable crafters from the [[Bazaar]] of [[Middle Dura]] have
moved here in recent years. The architects sought
to overcome the negative perceptions of [[Dura]], and
the stonework is beautiful. Much of it was crafted
using red marble from Rose Quarry, once a thriving [[Cyran|Cyre]] supplier which now lies in ruins in [[Darguun]]. The rest of the towers consist of red granite
and brick. With a host of subtle variations in shade,
the towers present a striking sight, especially in the
light of the setting sun.

Redstone has grown into one of the largest centers for commerce in the city, nearly twice the size of [[Granite Halls]]. Almost any sort of honest trade
can be found in Redstone, from bakers to wigmakers. There are two banks in Redstone, including a [[Kundarak]] [[enclave]] and the smaller ''Lorrean Bank'', a
family business belonging to one of the [[sixty great families|Sixty]] of [[Sharn]]. The district also contains workhouses that draw on the population of [[Overlook]],
including a glassworks and a textile factory.
