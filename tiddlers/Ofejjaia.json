She has other issues on her personal agenda besides advancing the cause of the templars, and Baerdren fears she would drive the order into obsolescence or banishment if she were placed in charge. He keeps her at his side as a deputy and advisor, primarily to keep an eye on herâ€”though he admits she is wise and has made many good decisions on behalf of the order.",
