The [[medusa]] architects of [[Cazhaak Draal]] are specialized [[adept]]s capable of producing effects like [[stone shape]], [[mold earth]], and [[meld into stone]]. They invoke the [[Shadow]] and the [[Devourer]]; the Shadow wove stone into the medusaâ€™s blood and shows them the secrets of working it, while they thank the Devourer for the raw gift of stone.
