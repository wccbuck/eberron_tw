type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This loose-fitting canvas hat is studded with fishing lures. When the command word is spoken, this hat grows into a decent 15ft dingy with oars and an anchor. The boat can hold up to five human-sized creatures comfortably.

When transformed back into a hat, any objects or creatures onboard the boat are gently ejected.
