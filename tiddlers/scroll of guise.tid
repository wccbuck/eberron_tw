The magic in this scroll enables the reader to adopt the semblance of a specific creature. You can read this scroll to make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings—look like a specific creature (determined when the scroll was created) for up to 1 hour. The changes wrought by this effect are illusory and fail to hold up to physical inspection.
