Issues that concern the entire nation go before the Iron Council, which meets in the [[Ferrous House]] in the city of [[Krona Peak]] in [[Mroranon]]hold. Currently, [[Torlan Mroranon]] serves as the arbiter of the Council, but each clan governs its own hold.\n\nAlthough House [[Kundarak]] officially has no voice on the Iron Council and are mere observers, many believe the [[dragonmarked house]] still holds great sway in the government of the [[Mror Holds]]. When the [[Last War]] broke out, the voice of [[Morrikan d'Kundarak]] from his observerâ€™s seat at the Iron Council was said to be the first to whisper of Mror independence.",
