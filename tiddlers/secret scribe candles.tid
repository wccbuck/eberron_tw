This pair of candles are magically linked and never seem to run out of wick. You can light one of the candles to cause it to burn with a blue flame. By holding parchment over the flame, any ink on the page is burnt off, leaving the paper unharmed and unmarked. When you finish using the candle in this way, you can extinguish the flame as you normally would. Once you do, the linked candle suddenly comes alight with an orange flame that cannot be extinguished by nonmagical means. The newly lit candle gives off a faint lavender scent. By holding a plain piece of parchment over the orange flame, the ink from the first piece of parchment is magically burnt on to the new one. Once all the ink has been transcribed onto new parchment in this way, the orange flame winks out.
