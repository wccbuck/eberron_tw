He is a fair man and believes that hard work and dedication to a task should be rewarded. However, his greatest concern is protecting the interest of the people of [[Upper Central]]; the problems of the poor of [[Lower Dura]] hold little interest for him.\n\nJavan remains one of [[Sharn]]'s wealthiest citizens, and\nthe [[Aurum]] actively seeks to recruit him for their\nPlatinum Concord—so far, unsuccessfully.
