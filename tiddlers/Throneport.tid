Below the castle walls of [[Thronehold]] stands Throneport, a small
town that arose during the old [[kingdom|Galifar]]’s height. Since no one ruled Thronehold during the [[Last War]], the town was not subject to any nation’s laws—criminals, exiles, mercenaries, and other scum arrived and prospered. The town became a haven for the desperate and villainous. The end of the Last War checked its decline as the [[dragonmarked house]]s and citizens
and officials from each of the [[Five Nations]] returned
to the island. The criminal element remains, but
Throneport is becoming a functioning community
once more, one that all nations recognize as neutral
ground.
