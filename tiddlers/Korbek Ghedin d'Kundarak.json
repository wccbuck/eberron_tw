A thoughtful and quiet person, Korbek is one of the most influential individuals in [[Stormreach]], but one would never know it by his behavior. He runs\na tight ship and clearly sees a line of demarcation between his house and those outside it, despite his willingness to serve all who call on its services. Publicly, he is known for being nearly humorless when it comes to the security of his [[enclave]], and rumors of would-be interlopers disappearing without a trace circle throughout the city. Korbek is almost never encountered without his bodyguard [[Yarik|Yarik Ghedin d'Kundarak]], a hulking brick of a\n[[dwarf]] clad in [[mithral]] plate.\n\nFor more on the secrets of House Kundarak and Korbek's part in them, see [[Tower of Kol Korran]].",
