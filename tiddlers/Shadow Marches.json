        "text": "''Capital:'' [[Zarash'ak]] (unofficial)<br/>\n''Hallmarks:'' Eberron [[dragonshard]]s, herbs<br/>\n''Population:'' Approximately <<ntls>> (50% [[orc]]s, 22% [[human]]s, 10% [[goblin]]s, 15% [[half-orc]]s, 3% other)\n\nWhen most people think of the Shadow Marches, they\nimagine a fetid backwater where illiterate [[human]]s\nmingle with [[orc]]s and other foul creatures, practicing\nstrange rites by the light of the moons. While flawed,\nthis vision isn't entirely inaccurate. The Shadow\nMarches are a desolate land of swamps and moors. The\nhomeland of the orcs, the Marches were scarred in the\nancient conflict with the [[daelkyr]]. The fiends left twisted\ncreatures and [[aberration]]s in the swamps, and sowed\nseeds of madness that linger to this day. There are indeed moonlit rituals in the Marches: some to honor the daelkyr, others to maintain the wards that keep them\ntrapped in [[Khyber]].\n\nHumans came to the Marches long ago, refugees\nfleeing a war in the distant land of [[Sarlona]]. Over time\nthe two cultures merged, forming the Marches as they\nexist today.\n\nThe Marches had little contact with the Kingdom of\n[[Galifar]] or the east until a few hundred years ago, when\na House [[Sivis]] expedition made two discoveries: the region contained valuable [[dragonshard]]s, and a number of\nclans had manifested the [[dragonmark]] of [[Finding|Mark of Finding]]. This\nled to the foundation of House [[Tharashk]], as these clans\njoined together to master the economic potential of their\nmark and leverage their mineral wealth. \n\nThe Shadow Marches aren't a nation. No one voice\nspeaks for the clans and tribes, and most of the tribes\nhave no interest in dealing with outsiders. House [[Tharashk]] is the largest faction in the region, and their city of\n[[Zarash'ak]] is the center for commerce.\n\nHouse Tharashk is the main point of contact between\nthe Shadow Marches and the outside world. Tharashk\naside, the region remains a collection of tribes and cultists following their ancient traditions in the shadows of\nthe swamps. \n\n!! Interesting Things About {{!!article}}{{!!title}}\n\n* The untamed Shadow Marches are filled with mysteries. Relics of the [[daelkyr]] rest undisturbed in the depths of the swamps, along with foul monsters and [[druid]]ic shrines.\n* The Marches are the birthplace of the [[druid]]ic tradition of the [[Gatekeepers]]. Long ago, this sect defeated the vile [[daelkyr]]; today, its last champions continue to protect [[Eberron]] from [[aberration]]s and other extraplanar threats.\n* Even in defeat, the daelkyr sowed seeds of madness in the Marches. Followers of the [[Cults of the Dragon Below]] and mysterious [[jhorkaanta]] remain scattered across the region. Some of these cults work with [[mind flayer]]s and other [[aberration]]s. Others have no evil intent but are driven by dangerous delusions. \n\n!! Marcher Characters\n\nAs you develop a Marcher character or NPC, consider\nthe following:\n\n* ''The Mark of Finding.'' An alliance of Marcher clans formed House [[Tharashk]], but not all those who carried the mark chose to join this house. As a [[half-orc]] with the [[Mark of Finding]], you could be a child of the Marches with a strong tie to the house, or you could be a scion of a small tribe of hunters, proud of your independence and suspicious of the houses. Your ties to the Marches might be distant because you were born to a family that left years ago. Do you want to rediscover your ancestral roots?\n* ''Madness and Mysticism.'' Most Marchers have a mystical view of the world, beliefs shaped by the traditions of the [[Gatekeepers]] and the madness of the [[daelkyr]]. Marchers typically feel that the people of the treaty nations are blinded by their civilized ways. You have heard the truth in the voices of croaking frogs and seen it in the shadows shifting on the water. Whether you're loyal to the [[Gatekeepers]], the [[Sovereign Host]], or the [[Dragon Below|Cults of the Dragon Below]], superstitions inform your path.\n* ''Clan or Tribe?'' The people of the Shadow Marches are split into two distinct cultures. The clans blend the traditions of [[human]] and [[orc]], building towns and working with steel. If you were raised in one of the clans, the ways of civilization aren't that strange to you; you've seen the city of [[Zarash'ak]] and worked with House [[Tharashk]]. By contrast, the Marcher tribes maintain traditions that predate humanity. As nomadic hunter-gatherers, they don't work metals; they make their tools from stone, hide, wood, and bone. If your character is from one of the Marcher tribes, you might be the first of your people to leave the swamps. Why have you left your people, and how are you adapting to this new world? \n\n!! Cities and Sites\n\nThe clans of the Shadow Marches primarily live in small\ntowns and villages, their huts raised above the swamps\non stilts. The Shadow Marches contain many [[manifest zone]]s tied to [[Xoriat]] and [[Kythri]], the planes of madness and chaos.\nTime moves strangely in places in the deep swamps,\nwhich twists mundane [[beast]]s and plants into strange\nshapes. [[Daelkyr|daelkyr]] ruins linger in these areas, remnants of\nthe ancient war against the [[goblin]]s and [[orc]]s that once\ndominated [[Khorvaire]].\n\n!!!

Towns\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[location]tag[town]sort[title]]:filter[get[text]length[]compare:integer:gt[200]]\">>\n\n!!!

Aftermath of the Last War\n\nThe Shadow Marches aren't a nation, and the region\nwasn't recognized by the [[Treaty of Thronehold]]. Most\nMarchers have little interest in the outside world.\nMarcher tribes don't know the names or number of the\nnations beyond the swamps, let alone that they were\nat war. However, as House [[Tharashk]] gains power and\ninfluence in the world beyond the swamps, it has increased its presence in its homeland. The house has\nexpanded [[Zarash'ak]] dramatically over the last decade\nand is working on transforming other towns into cities.\nThis has caused tension with a number of tribes. And\nHouse Tharashk's mining operations and its urban\nexpansion always run the risk of disrupting [[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]]\nseals and unleashing ancient evils bound beneath\nthe Marches. ",
