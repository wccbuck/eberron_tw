Haztaratain Monastery is famous among [[Adarans]]
for its role in the birth of the [[kalashtar]] raceâ€”it was here
that [[Taratai]] and her followers first found respite from
their flight. From here, Taratai made her pilgrimage
across [[Adar]]. Many adherents of the [[Path of Light]] see
Haztaratain Monastery as a holy site, and some even make
the treacherous journey to the place. For some, this is a
religious pilgrimage; for others, it's a step on the path to
becoming a [[Haztaratain]] monk.

Carved into a mountainside, the monastery rests on an escarpment above a fertile valley. From the watchtowers chiseled into the living rock of the high coastal peaks, the guardians can look onto the coast of [[Riedra]] less than 50 miles away. ([[Riedrans]] avoid this stretch of water, known for its sudden squalls and disdained for its nearness to [[Adar]].) Adaran settlements are also within a day's journey of the fortress. Villagers in these places regularly supply the Haztaratain Monastery's inhabitants with goods and services, counting themselves lucky to live so near the sacred site.
