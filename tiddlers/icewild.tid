Icewild, or //muqqa//, is a blood-red rock lichen and stimulant that produces a feeling of energy and euphoria lasting
up to 6 hours. Consumption of one dose confers immunity
to the effects of fatigue or exhaustion for its duration. 

Icewild can be purchased in the less reputable sections of [[Whitetooth]] and [[Winterstead]].
