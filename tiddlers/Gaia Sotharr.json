She is young and idealistic, and she is locked in a power struggle with\nthe [[lich]] of [[Halden's Tomb]]. Neither seems to be able to get the upper hand in this struggle, and Gaia is too proud to call for help from her church. In fact, she has an curious fascination with [[Gath]]â€”as long as he exists, her life has meaning and purpose, and\nafter years of conflict she would not happily see him destroyed, though she gladly kills his minions and allies. It seems clear that Gath has similar feelings, if he can be said to feel, or else Gaia would certainly not be alive.",
