The owner is said to dine in the restaurant on a regular basis, but remains completely anonymous. Some people speculate that\nthe owner is a [[changeling]] or some other [[shapechanger]]. The maitre d'hotel, an aristocratic [[half-elf]] named ''Ravvan Mollac'', smiles at these rumors, for he actually owns the restaurant. He takes great delight in seating customers who spend their entire meal staring around the restaurant trying to pick out the owner.\n\nThe Azure Gateway is also a luxurious hotel, having replaced an old [[Ghallanda]] inn only a few years ago.",
