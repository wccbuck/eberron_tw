        "text": "One of the fabulous\nrestaurants offering stunning views and exquisite\nmeals, the Azure Gateway is not as well known as the\n[[Celestial Vista]], but it is rarely as crowded as a result.\nThe menu is exotic, offering delights from [[Thrane]]\n(including fine steaks), [[Karrnath]] (such as their\nfamous breaded veal as well as traditional sausage\ndishes), and [[Aundair]] (including noodles and meats\nin tomato- and oil-based sauces). The interesting\nthing about the Azure Gateway is that no one knows\nthe identity of its owner. He or she is said to dine\nin the restaurant on a regular basis but remains\ncompletely anonymous. Some people speculate that\nthe owner is a [[changeling]] or some other [[shapechanger]]. The maitre d'hotel, an aristocratic [[half-elf]] named Ravvan Mollac smiles at these rumors, for he actually owns the restaurant. He takes great delight in seating customers who spend their entire meal staring around the restaurant trying to pick out the owner.",
