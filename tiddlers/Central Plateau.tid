!! Things to Do in Central Plateau

Looking for work or amusement in this quarter? Some
of the things you can do here include:

* ''Attend an auction.'' The [[Aurora Gallery]] in [[Platinum Heights]] is the finest auction house in Sharn and specializes in auctions of exotic magic items and relics from [[Xen'drik]]. You never know what's going to be available—or who will be bidding against you.
* ''Plan a heist.'' Perhaps your goals depend on recovering an item a villain has hidden in the [[vaults|Vaults]] of [[Korranath]]. Can you penetrate the most secure facility in Sharn?
* ''Go to jail.'' The [[King's Citadel]] in [[Ambassador Towers]] is also Sharn's high-security prison.
* ''Worship.'' The primary temples of the [[Sovereign Host]] and the [[Silver Flame]] are located in [[Middle Central]], along with a host of shrines to specific sovereigns and lesser faiths. Take part in a festival or drop in for some spiritual guidance!
* ''Engage in espionage.'' Whether you work for your nation or get entangled in the schemes of the [[dragonmarked house]]s, [[Middle Central]] is home to a lot of powerful people who have a use for capable agents.
