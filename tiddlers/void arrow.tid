This pitch-dark piece of ammunition is composed of densely packed shadows. A creature hit by this magic projectile suffers psychic damage instead of ordinary physical damage. This arrow makes no sound when it's fired or strikes a surface, leaves no discernible wounds, and vanishes immediately after hitting a creature.
