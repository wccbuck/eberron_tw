Holy water is water that has been infused with positive energy, such as from the [[plane]] of [[Irian]], or by the touch of a [[celestial]], or by some religious ritual. It is used in various [[divine magic]] rituals and abjurations, but can also be used as a weapon against [[fiend]]s and [[Mabar]]an [[undead]]. When splashed on such a creature, the target suffers acid and/or radiant damage.
