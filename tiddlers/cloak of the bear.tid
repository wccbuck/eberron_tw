title: cloak of the bear
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This huge cloak is made from the entire skin of a grizzly bear, clasped with rough iron hooks. If you are a spellcaster, you can cast [[polymorph]] on yourself to transform into a grizzly bear. However, there is a small chance you will forget that you were once human, in which case the spell does not wear off after 1 hour, and you will be unable to remove the cloak without magical assistance such as [[dispel magic]] or [[remove curse]].
