This cloth mask converts the words that pass through it into rude obscenities. While wearing the mask over your mouth, your words are heard as angry insults and swears instead of the ones you intend. You do not hear these words. An insightful creature who hears these obscenities may be able to determine that the words it hears are not your own. Verbal spells, command words, and actual obscenities you say are unaffected by the mask's magic and are heard normally by creatures within earshot.
