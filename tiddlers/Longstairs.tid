Longstairs is a quiet residential district, and its inhabitants like it that way. The people of Longstairs are
primarily [[human]] and [[dwarf]] commoners, with a few
experts and [[magewright]]s mixed in. These citizens go
out of their way to maintain the stability of the neighborhood, and anything disruptive is quickly met with
unified opposition. The apartments in Longstairs
are reasonably priced and well maintained. However,
adventurers who settle in Longstairs may have to make
an extra effort to fit in; characters that engage in wild
antics may be run out of the neighborbood.
