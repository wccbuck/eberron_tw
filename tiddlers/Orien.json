It doesn't matter if it's a letter, a person, or a hundred tons of steel. Whether we have to cross mountains, rivers, or the [[Mournland]] itself, Orien finds a way.//\n\n<div align=\"right\">—Bali d'Orien, veteran courier</div>\n\nThe House of Passage manages land transportation.\nThe [[lightning rail]] is the house's most dramatic tool, but\nOrien also runs caravans and coaches across the length\nof [[Khorvaire]] on magically-enhanced [[trade roads|Orien trade roads]]. [[Dragonshard|dragonshard]] focus items ensure that\nthe fastest vehicles are those driven by heirs with the\n[[Mark of Passage]], but the house also licenses unmarked\nteamsters. The [[Couriers Guild]] of House Orien delivers\nmail and packages and has a branch that handles more\ncovert and dangerous deliveries. Orien also maintains an extensive network of [[teleportation circle]]s in cities throughout the [[Five Nations]]. However, teleportation is difficult, expensive, and widely regarded as unsafe.\n\nOrien has dominated transportation for centuries,\nbut now the house is facing challenges. The [[Mournland]]\nis a dramatic obstacle for ground transportation, and\nBaron [[Kwanti d'Orien]] has had tremendous difficulty securing funds to rebuild the lightning rail line across the blasted landscape. Indeed, he spends most of his time\naway from his headquarters in [[Aundair]], trying to raise\nfunds for the project while keeping an eye on house\noperations. He travels across western [[Khorvaire]] in his\npersonal [[lightning rail]] coach, the Silver Unicorn—a reference to the house's [[unicorn]] emblem.\n\nHouse Orien's problems don't end with the Mournland, though. The expanding role of [[Lyrandar]] [[airship]]s threatens the house's business. Baron Kwanti would\nlike to be able to offer more instantaneous transportation, but long-distance teleportation is a service only the strongest Orien dragonmarks can provide. So the house\nis working with House [[Cannith]] in an effort to unlock\nand enhance this gift of the Mark of Passage. Orien\nheirs might be caught up in these experiments or in the\nrivalry with House Lyrandar. \n\n!! History of House {{!!title}}\n\nThe [[Mark of Passage]] appeared in the region of\n[[Aundair]] about 1,900 years ago. The merchants and\nteamsters who developed the mark were experienced\ntravelers who soon discovered their common bond.\nInitially, there was some competition between the\nmarked families, but members soon realized what\nthey could accomplish by working together.\n\nThrough a combination of magic and diplomacy,\nHouse Orien secured safe passage for its caravans.\nAs its fortunes grew, the house improved existing\nroads and developed [[new ones|Orien trade roads]]. In the days before the\n[[Sivis]] [[speaking stone]] network, House Orien ran a post\nsystem that was used across the [[Five Nations]].\n\nThe [[lightning rail]] was developed with House\n[[Cannith]] and the [[elemental]] binders of [[Zilargo]]. This\ntechnology revolutionized House Orien’s business, and soon the [[Trailblazers]] were laying [[conductor stone]]s across [[Khorvaire]].\n\n!!! The Last War\n\nThe [[Last War]] was difficult for House Orien. Bridges were destroyed. [[Lightning rail|lightning rail]] lines were broken. And toward the end of the war, House [[Lyrandar]] took to the air. House Orien’s dominance in the field of transportation is no longer\nassured. With this changing situation in mind, House\nOrien has redoubled its work with teleportation.\n\n!!
