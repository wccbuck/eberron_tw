        "text": "The Glass Tower was once one of the fantastic floating towers of the [[Skyway]] of [[Sharn]], one of the city's oldest floating citadels. On [[9 Olarune 918 YK|Khorvaire calendar]], saboteurs believed to be working for [[Aundair]] destroyed the magic supporting the tower with powerful [[abjuration]] magic, sending it careening down, crumbling as it fell. Most of the wreckage landed in the [[Dagger River]], but a significant portion of the citadel struck the district of Godsgate in [[Lower Dura]], causing widespread devastation. A poor area to begin with, Godsgate never recovered from the disaster, and was left in ruins. Today the condemned district is known as [[Fallen]], and the event is commemorated each year on [[Crystalfall]].\n\nWhile the disaster occurred in the early years of the [[Last War]], no foreign power ever claimed responsibility for the attack. Most of the common folk of [[Sharn]] blame the [[wizard]]s of [[Aundair]], but dedicated historians and scholars of magic remain unconvinced, and have continued to study the tower's fall.\n\nThe true answer to the fall of the Glass Tower may have no bearing on mortal wars. Whispers from the wretched residents of [[Fallen]] suggest coordinated action among some of the [[Raver|Ravers]] tribes, a dedicated campaign to collect and reassemble fragments of a broken statue among the rubble of the Glass Tower. The statue is nearly complete, and is beginning to bear a disturbing resemblance to a petrified [[radiant idol]]. Could the devastation of the Glass Tower have been caused by the curse of a fallen [[angel]]?",
