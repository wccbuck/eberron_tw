"Faldren's Folly" is the name given to an attempt by Commander Rand Faldren to create his own sovereign state within [[Breland]] in the midst of the [[Last War]] over 30 years ago. In 961 YK, King Boranex of Breland committed suicide after the deaths of his two eldest sons. While Prince [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] had proven himself in war, he was seen as an adventurer and dilettante, and not a suitable heir to the throne. Commander Faldren sought to rally support within the Brelish army for an overthrow of the monarchy, placing power in the hands of the [[parliament|Breland Parliament]]. He stopped short of attempting a coup, and stood down when the majority of parliament condemned the idea. 

However, several years later, sparked in part by the 962 alliance with [[Zilargo]] and the influx in [[gnome]] immigrants, Rand Faldren seized control of the fortress of [[Orcbone]], near the border with the [[Barrens|Droaam]] and the newly-independent [[Eldeen Reaches]]. He proclaimed the fortress to be the heart of “New Wroat,” reclaiming the pre-[[Galifar]] name of the nation, and called on those who sought freedom to join him, following the model of [[Q'barra]]. A small force of [[Brelish|Breland]] soldiers were dispatched to retake Orcbone, but they failed; given the many pressing concerns on other fronts, King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] chose to withdraw rather than to devote a major force to bring down Rand Faldren's rebellion. For almost ten years, he let Faldren handle the defense his new settlers and to serve as a buffer against raiders from the Barrens. 

As numbers grew, Faldren encouraged settlers to establish themselves in villages between [[Orcbone]] and the [[Border Road]]. These settlers were prepared for [[minotaur]] raiders from the [[Fist|Turakbar's Fist]], and repelled several attacks. But they weren’t prepared for the hunger of [[Sora Maenya]]. Appearing as a starving young woman, tall and thin with jet-black hair, the infamous [[hag]] appeared at the gates of Orcbone in early 972 claiming to be a refugee from a nearby village which had been attacked by [[troll]]s. A team of scouts was dispatched to investigate, only to find an entire village of settlers reduced to a stack of picked-clean bones by the town well. That is, every bone except the skulls, which were all missing. When the scouts returned to Orcbone, they found the same fate awaited Rand Faldren and the rest of the veteran soldiers stationed there—all reduced to bones stacked on the table in the great hall, and the skulls were gone.

King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] responded swiftly, sending another contingent to reclaim and fortify Orcbone, establishing it as the stronghold of the [[Westwind Riders]]. New Wroat was no more. Today, many feel that Faldren was a martyr to the principles of a democratic [[Breland]]—that he was driven to his fate by the outdated monarchy, and that Boranel left the settlers to die because they challenged his authority. Today, any western cells of the [[Swords of Liberty]] call Rand Faldren a hero (particularly his nephew, [[Tars Faldren]]), and demand that stronger action be taken against the creatures of [[Droaam]].
