title: Shadow Schism
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

House [[Phiarlan]] has always been fractious. The [[Mark of Shadow]] appeared not in one family line but in several, and relations among the Phiarlan
lines had been strained in the past. Five lines—the Tialaen, Shol, Elorrenthi, [[Thuranni]],
and [[Paelion]]—were the most prominent and influential
families in House Phiarlan before the schism. Each line
had its particular strengths within the broad field of the
house’s activities, and preferred clients among the factions
and organizations of the [[Five Nations]]. Rivalry among
those five lines, not to mention the numerous smaller lines
within the house hierarchy, often grew fierce. Ultimately,
the strains of the [[Last War]] proved to be greater than the
ties that bound the [[Phiarlan]] families together.

The final blow came in 972 YK. The Order of the
[[Emerald Claw]]—at the time, still a chivalric order of [[Karrnath]]—was a favored client of the [[Thuranni]] family, as well as the most important espionage-related organization in Karrnath’s government. Knight Superior Kadrath ir’Vardikk, a high-ranking Emerald Claw officer, came to Lord [[Elar Thuranni d’Phiarlan|Elar d'Thuranni]] with information that pointed to a [[Brelish|Breland]] plot to assassinate both [[Karrnath]]’s
[[regent|Moranna]] and its young king. The plot relied heavily on
the talents of the [[Paelion]] line, the most fearsome assassins in House [[Phiarlan]]. Sir Kadrath demanded that the
Thuranni line eliminate the Paelions before the assassins
could carry out their mission. 

At first, Lord [[Elar|Elar d'Thuranni]] was hesitant to strike against his
own house. He first tried to verify the information Sir
Kadrath had brought him. What the [[Thuranni]] agents
uncovered, however, was a far greater threat than a simple
assassination plot against [[Karrnath]]. Lord Tolar Paelion
d’Phiarlan, it seemed, had concocted an elaborate
scheme to bring the [[Last War]] to an end and gather the
reins of power in [[Khorvaire]], not in [[Breland]]’s hands, but
in his own. Part of this plan, Lord Elar learned, involved
exterminating the other [[Phiarlan]] families as well as the
leadership of the other [[dragonmarked house]]s. 

Some might have dismissed these plans as megalomaniacal ravings presenting little serious threat. Since they originated in the most fearsome line of assassins in
all [[Khorvaire]], however, Lord Elar took them utterly seriously, and he ordered an immediate strike to exterminate
the [[Paelion]]s before Lord Tolar could carry out his plan. 

Lord [[Elar|Elar d'Thuranni]] himself killed Tolar and his immediate family, while the [[Thuranni]] agents at his command slaughtered every [[Paelion]] within the family holdings in [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]], and every one they could find in [[Phiarlan]] holdings across [[Khorvaire]]. 

Outraged at this apparent betrayal, Baron [[Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan]] declared the [[Thuranni]] line excoriate. Defiant, Lord [[Elar|Elar d'Thuranni]] refused this punishment, instead declaring the formation of a new [[dragonmarked house]].
The clients of the Thuranni family continued doing business with the excoriate house, and Elar—now taking the title of Baron—even managed to acquire some clients formerly
loyal to the [[Paelion]] line.

To this day, Baron [[Elar d'Thuranni]] maintains that
he acted out of loyalty to his own house and all the [[dragonmarked house]]s, quashing a plot that would have thrown
all of [[Khorvaire]] into even greater upheaval. There are
many sides to the story, however, and—as in all tales of
espionage—the truth is hard to discern.

Some would suggest that the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]] actually fabricated evidence against the [[Paelion]]s, bringing some of it to Lord Elar while planting the rest in the Paelion holdings for Elar’s spies to uncover. Some
further suggest a link between the Emerald Claw’s role
in the Shadow Schism and Regent [[Moranna]]’s decision to
outlaw the order just four years later.

Other theories suggest wilder conspiracies. Some
claim that [[human]] agents of the draconic [[Chamber]] helped
to bring the schism about in order to fulfill prophetic
claims about thirteen houses or the split of a single house.
(Many of these theorists further claim that the same
Chamber agents are working to prevent House [[Cannith]]
from splintering for the same reason.) Others whisper that
at least one prisoner in [[Dreadhold]] is imprisoned there for
his role in fomenting the schism. Still others claim that
Lord [[Elar|Elar d'Thuranni]] and Baron [[Elvinor|Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan]] amicably agreed to a split in the house and used a mutual enemy, the [[Paelion]] line, as
a scapegoat to cloak their true intentions.

Whatever the truth, the Shadow Schism was the
most important consequence of the [[Last War]] as far as the
[[dragonmarked house]]s are concerned. Just as the empire
of [[Galifar]] was fractured into smaller nations, so too the
[[Last War]] left the dragonmarked houses broken, unsure
of their role in the new world and their ties to the new
political powers of [[Khorvaire]].
