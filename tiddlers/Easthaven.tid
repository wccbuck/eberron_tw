''Population:'' <<ntls>>

Easthaven is a town on the island of [[Orthoss]] in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], located on the southern shore of [[Lac Dinneshere]]. As other towns in the region have settled into a predictable pattern of existence, Easthaven has continued to grow and reinvent itself; today, it has evolved into a frontier traders' paradise.

Easthaven's founders were thieves from the city of [[Port Verge]], [[Questor]]; they refused to kowtow to the local fleet and were driven out. To this day, Easthaven honors its shady founders by declaring pickpocketing legal within the town limits—which explains the "Watch your pouch!" signs posted in various local establishments.

The leader of Easthaven is speaker Danneth Waylen, who is respected for his humility and forthrightness. Captain Imdra Arlaggath commands the town's militia.

A major paved road called the Eastway stretches between Easthaven and [[Bryn Shander]].

!! Locations in Easthaven

The docks of Easthaven include the ''ferry'', a keelboat which transports people and cargo to the towns of [[Caer-Dineval]] and [[Caer-Konig]].

The ''Wet Trout'', located near the docks, is the largest and loudest tavern in Easthaven, known for its ribald atmosphere and rumor-mongering. A great chimney squarely in the building's center has hearths on either side to warm the tavern's two common rooms. The tavern's current owner and proprietor is Nymetra Myskyn, a brusque woman who loves to complain.

On the other side of town, the ''White Lady Inn'' is a musty old establishment named after a local legend—a pale ghost rumored to walk on [[Lac Dinneshere]], haunting the spot where her rich husband drowned. A [[halfling]] [[bard]] named Rinaldo, a fixture at the inn, is fond of plucking his fiddle while recounting his tale: that the White Lady's husband was a miser who kept his treasure in a heavy, locked chest that never left his side. Perhaps it was this heavy chest, suggests Rinaldo, that capsized his boat and sent the man to his sunken grave, or perhaps it was the fright of seeing his dead wife that caused him to capsize the boat and drown. Either way, Rinaldo is certain that the man's treasure lies at the bottom of the lake, waiting for some intrepid explorer to find it. The inn's sullen, elderly proprietor, Bartaban, has heard the halfling's rambling far too often to be humored by it.

!! Adventure Hooks

* ''//Rinaldo's Séance.//'' Rinaldo is planning to conduct a séance in a back room of the inn and has invited half a dozen other guests to join him. Characters who spend one or more nights at the inn are invited by Rinaldo to join his séance. If the characters decline, Rinaldo is disappointed and tries to get them to change their minds by saying, "We live in dark times. Perhaps the spirit of the White Lady can help. Aren't you curious to hear what she has to say?" Succeeding on the group attempt causes the White Lady's spirit to manifest in the room; she can answer up to three questions by tracing short, two- to five-word responses on the room's frosted windows.
* ''//Toil and Trouble.//'' The captain of Easthaven's militia, Imdra Arlaggath, offers the PCs a quest. Some fishers have gone missing on [[Lac Dinneshere]], and she wants the characters to take a boat and search for them. She knows where the fishers like to fish and urges the characters to search that part of the lake first. If they heed Imdra's advice, they find the fishers' boats pulled up on the ice within short walking distance from a frozen cave previously hidden under snow and ice. This cave, the characters soon discover, is the lair of a [[hag]] named Maud Chiselbone. Characters who explore the cave complex find the bodies of the fishers, as well as Maud's [[cauldron of plenty]]. The cauldron is a stunning discovery and a welcome one for the people of Ten-Towns, if the characters choose to part with it.
