All three are virtually identical, providing reliable room and board for\n[[0.2c|money]] per night. A House [[Phiarlan]] entertainer is typically on duty in the each inn; the lineup changes each night, alternating between song, dance, and comedy.\n\n(Disclaimer: the tribex stew served at the Jhodra Gold Dragon Inn is not actual [[tribex]], but rather a [[pomow]]-plant-based meat substitute being tested by House [[Ghallanda]].)",
