        "text": "On the Day of [[Mourning]], a cadre of [[warforged]] deserted its post at [[Fort Zombie]]\nin [[Karrnath]] and entered the [[Mournland]]. These warforged took the name Godforged, claiming they each had a soul bestowed by a discorporate [[construct]] god.\nBelieving that a soul inhabits a body capable of consciousness only when the body is ready, the Godforged have taken it upon themselves to build a body for their god so it can walk among them.\n\nThe [[warforged]] believers also hold that a soul\nbecomes more powerful as the body increases in\npower and size. Therefore, Godforged augment their\nbodies with attached and embedded components. Warforged that die are believed to join the Becoming God, waiting for reincarnation in a new body or to\njoin the god in its physical form.\n\nIn addition to quests for self-perfection and to\nbuild the Becoming Godâ€™s body, the Godforged seek\na way to build new [[warforged]]. This goal could bring\nthem into conflict with the [[Lord of Blades]], who controls a [[creation forge]].\n\nSome believe that the Godforged hear the call of a [[fiend]] from [[Khyber]] or the being at the root of the [[Mourning]]. If this belief is true, the Becoming God could be a threat to [[Khorvaire]] and all of [[Eberron]].",
