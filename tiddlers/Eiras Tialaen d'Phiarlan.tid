One frequent guest of the [[Stormreach]] [[Phiarlan enclave|Phiarlan Enclave (Stormreach)]] is Eiras Tialaen, a [[bard]] who has
devoted his life to recovering lost artistic traditions of
the ancient [[elves|elf]] from the depths of [[Xen'drik]]. Tialaen
was scarred in an accident in the jungles, but he hides
his disfigurement beneath a layer of [[illusion]]. The
bard could be a useful patron or ally for explorers, or
a rival; a PC might want a [[magic item]] for its power,
while Tialaen wants the relic for its artistry.
