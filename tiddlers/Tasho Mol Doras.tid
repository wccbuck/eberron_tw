Tasho Mol Doras, the ambassador of [[Zilargo]] at the [[Sharn]] [[embassy|Zilargo Embassy (Sharn)]], is a brilliant diplomat and ruthless negotiator. He is always looking for a
way to get an edge over his political and mercantile opponents, and quickly seizes upon any sign weakness and exploits it. He is a skilled actor and can feign a wide range of emotions, but when the interests of his nation or family are at stake, he acts without mercy.
