As First Wand of Argonth, Quill is one of [[Breland]]’s most capable field [[evokers|evocation]], and commands the regiment of [[wandslinger]]s and [[magewright]]s who maintain and operate [[Argonth]]’s [[arcane artillery]]. In battle, he generally operates one of the [[focus staff|siege staff]]s, and his skill is so remarkable that he can actually spare his allies even when unleashing devastating blasts of magic. \n\nQuill is an energetic Brelish [[gnome]]. He is a clever arcanist, and is studying the mystical techniques of the [[Venomous Demesne]]; this could bring him into contact with adventurers who make interesting discoveries.",
