They aren't directly tied to the [[Boromar|Boromar Clan]] family, but the master of the gang pays a tithe to the\nBoromars, and if the Boromars send word to them that\ncertain targets are to be avoided, the Little Fingers\ndo so. In return, the Boromars ensure that the [[Sharn Watch]] in Middle Dura largely leaves the Fingers alone. ",
