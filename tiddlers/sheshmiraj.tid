Sheshmiraj (or //shagaspa// in old [[Nulakazi]]) are equine beasts native to the [[Mae-Kree]] province of [[Syrkarn]]. Fanged and clawed, these horse-like [[monstrosities|monstrosity]] are vicious as well as massive, weighing in at over 2200 lbs on average and standing six feet tall from the ground to the top of the shoulder. Sheshmiraj are primarily carnivorous, and roam the grasslands in herds or packs hunting anything from goats to megafauna.

The bravest nomads of [[Mae-Kree]] tame sheshmiraj and ride them as steeds. While tamed sheshmiraj can be fiercely loyal, they have been known to violently turn on their riders in fits of frenzy.
