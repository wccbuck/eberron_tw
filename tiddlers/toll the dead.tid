You point at one creature you can see within 60 feet, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must resist your magic or suffer some [[necrotic damage|damage type]]. If the target is already wounded or in some other way is closer to death, this spell does additional necrotic damage.
