//Three full moons hung in the sky over Bone Lane. Graywall was a nocturnal city, and those creatures that shunned the sun came out to barter and fight under the light of the moons. Bursting out of the [[Bloody Tooth]], Thorn ran headlong into the milling throng of monsters. She pressed into the crowd, darting between the legs of [[giant]]s and leaping over [[goblin]]s, weaving her way through the maze of flesh and fur.//

//A narrow alley lay to her right, and Thorn ducked into the opening. She emerged in a small courtyard, a convergence for alleys leading to the major streets. The air was filled with a foul stench, hot blood and bitter chemicals, and even though she'd been prepared for it, Thorn had to pause to hold back the bile in her throat. The pavement was dark, crusted stone, and Thorn realized she was walking across dried blood.//

//She had evaded her pursuer, but now had a new problem: the beast sitting in front of the slaughterhouse gate, calmly devouring the grisly corpse of a [[centaur]].//

//"Are you hungry, little one?" the [[manticore]] rumbled. Blood dripped onto the stones as he spoke. "You're welcome to a leg. I assume you don't want an arm."//

[[Droaam]], one of the strangest places on
[[Khorvaire]], is a land of monsters that serves as
a home to [[medusa]]s and [[minotaur]]s. [[Gargoyle|gargoyle]]s
and [[wyvern]]s circle in the skies, and [[goblin]]s and
[[werewolves|werewolf]] lurk in the forests. For centuries, it has been
an untamed frontier. Then the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]]
forged it into a nation. Few in the outer world expected
this monstrous alliance to survive a year, but it has endured for over a decade. Towns are rising in the wastelands, built with the strength of [[giant]]s and the
cunning stonework of the [[medusa]]s. One such town lies on the border of Droaam and [[Breland]], carved from the foothills of the [[mountains|Graywall Mountains]] from which it
takes its name. This is Graywall, city of monsters
and gateway to [[Droaam]].

!! Why Come to Graywall?

Though smaller than [[Sharn]] or [[Stormreach]], Graywall
is a unique city with much to offer to adventurers.

''A Free City:'' Not only is [[Droaam]] not one of the [[Five Nations]]—it isn’t even bound by the [[Treaty of Thronehold]]. As such, the laws of the east have no
weight here, making it a haven for bandits, deserters, and all manner of war criminals. Free from the [[Code of Galifar]], it is also a source for dangerous goods
banned in the eastern lands, from mystical narcotics
to surplus weapons of war smuggled from [[Aundair]]
or [[Breland]]. Adventurers might have to pry a fugitive
out from the town of monsters, prevent an agent of
the [[Emerald Claw]] from making an deal for arcane
armaments, or find a shady fence to make their own
lucrative bargain.

''Ruins of Dhakaan:'' [[Droaam]] holds secrets still untouched by [[human]] hands. Ruins have lain empty since the [[Gatekeepers]] drove the [[daelkyr]] into the depths... along with other dungeons held by monstrous forces—natural, [[aberrant|aberration]], and [[undead]]. Graywall can make an excellent base of operations for adventurers searching for the secrets of the [[Age of Monsters]].

''Home, Unsavory Home:'' Many "monstrous" races make excellent player characters.
[[Minotaur|minotaur]]s, [[gnoll]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, and [[tiefling]]s have an easier time in [[Droaam]] than they do in the civilized nations. If a group chooses to play a fully monstrous party, Graywall might be their home town and base of operations, from which they explore [[Dhakaan]]i ruins, clash with [[Brelish|Breland]] border guards, and get drawn into the intrigues of Droaam’s many [[warlord]]s. Alternatively, the [[minotaur]] who now wanders across [[Khorvaire]] with his [[human]] comrades might still remember Graywall as his home, and be drawn back when an old enemy strikes his clan. And if the PCs are convicted of a crime they didn’t commit, Graywall can prove a safe (if unsavory) home.

!! Life in Graywall

[[Droaam]] is a young nation. Just 30 years ago,
Graywall was a broken mass of [[Dhakaan]]i ruins.
In the intervening decades, a nation has taken root
in the wilderness, and Graywall has become the
frontier between the realms of humanity and the
land of monsters. During the [[Last War]] it became
a staging ground for monstrous forces, both those
serving as mercenaries with House [[Tharashk]] and
the warbands raiding [[Breland]]. With the war’s end,
the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] have devoted significant
resources to establishing a strong presence on the
border of the [[Five Nations]]. As a result, Graywall is
a booming town. The expansion never ends, since
teams of [[ogre]]s, [[orc]]s, and [[medusa]]s work on new barracks and reinforce the fortress walls. Ogres quarry
and shift stone, while [[kobold]]s and [[goblin]]s delve in
the [[byeshk]] mines and toil in the workhouses and
fields. [[Gnoll|gnoll]] hunters bring hides and meat in from
the surrounding wilds. And then there are the people
of the east—bandits, deserters, merchants, and more,
all looking for opportunities.

The majority of the monsters that live in Graywall are in the employ of the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]]. The rewards for this service are food, shelter, and a sense of pride, along with rations of bitter grog. It’s a hard life, but better than many of them would have had decades ago—especially for the [[goblin]]s, who were typically subjugated by more powerful creatures. In recent years, foreigners have brought the gold of [[Galifar]] to the town, giving birth both to services catering to the outlanders... and to criminals who prey upon them.

See also [[Culture of Droaam]].

!!! Law and Order

In Graywall, the designated representative of the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] is [[Xorchylic]], an ancient [[mind flayer]]. Xorchylic personally commands the [[Flayer Guard]], a force of [[ogre]]s, [[orc]]s, and [[minotaur]]s supplemented by [[harpies|harpy]], [[gargoyle]]s, and a squad of war [[troll]]s of [[Maenya's Fist]]. Xorchylic can also call on the mercenary [[gnoll]]s of the [[Znir Pact]], as well
his allies within House [[Tharashk]].

At the end of the day, Graywall is a frontier town.
PCs can get away with a lot, as long as they don’t do
anything that directly inconveniences [[Xorchylic]].
This is especially true when the crime targets a foreigner. Xorchylic doesn’t recognize the laws of other lands and won’t punish [[Brelish|Breland]] bandits who take sanctuary in its town. But neither will it call on his guards to protect them if someone comes looking for them... unless, of course, the newcomers somehow become a threat to Xorchylic. Serious
crimes are punished with immediate execution. For
lesser crimes, a victim is branded and then sent to the
arena for a period of time based on the crime. Should
he survive the duration of his sentence, he is free to
go. It’s said that Xorchylic sometimes uses its mental
powers to punish offenders; some say it implants
phobias or psychoses, but this might simply be rumor.

Although there are no written laws, the people of
Graywall do have the right to bring grievances before
a [[medusa]] magistrate of [[Katra's Voice]]. If the magistrate considers the
case to be frivolous, she turns her gaze on the
plaintiff. As a result, the caseload is light—but many
of the weaker creatures take pleasure in the idea that
they have a voice.

Xorchylic has granted House [[Tharashk]] the right to prosecute crimes committed in the [[Calabas]], the foreign quarter. Viceroy [[Kundran Torrn]] of House [[Tharashk]] can call on the forces of his own house, including a substantial force of [[orc]] soldiers, for this purpose; he also employs [[ogre]], [[gargoyle]], and [[gnoll]] mercenaries. He acts if a crime directly threatens the stability of the [[Calabas]]. Otherwise, he takes action only if it can be conclusively proven that a crime has occurred, which requires the
plaintiff to employ the services of [[Tharashk]] [[inquisitive]]s. So justice is available within the confines of the Calabas, but it comes at a price.

!!! Entertainment

Beyond the [[Calabas]], the people of Graywall are
largely given over to simple pleasures. Many enjoy a good brawl, whether a simple wrestling match in the street, a prize fight in a tavern, or a battle royale in the [[arena|Bloodstone Arena]]. Other forms of entertainment vary by
species. [[Goblin|goblin]]s enjoy song and music. The [[changeling]]s of Graywall practice a form of dance that incorporates their shapeshifting abilities. [[Ogre|ogre]]s love tests of strength and endurance, and adventurers
wandering through [[Bloodstone]] might come upon
a group of ogres holding massive stones over their
heads. Although few citizens have gold, many love
to gamble, and it’s common to see teeth or other
bartering tokens scattered on the ground around
an impromptu match.

In addition to grog, many of the monsters of Graywall partake of an unusual intoxicant: [[harpy]] song. This is provided as a public service in the [[grist]] mills where laborers go in their off hours, and most public houses also have a “songbird.” When performing in this capacity, a harpy rarely engages the fully stupefying effect of her voice; nonetheless, her songs possess a hypnotic beauty.

!! The Shape of Graywall

Five thousand years ago, the [[Dhakaan]]i [[goblin]]s built
a fortress to defend the valley between the [[Graywall Mountains]] and the [[Byeshk Mountains]]. [[Droaam]] was a
land of monsters even then, and while the Dhakaani
built a number of cities past the Graywall, they wanted
to be sure they could hold the gate. During the [[Xoriat]] Incursion, the fortress of //Korash Khaar// stood strong for years of battle. Then the [[daelkyr]] took to the field
of battle. [[Dyrrn]] the Corruptor came to Korash Khaar,
and the fortress fell before him. Some say the fortress
walls absorbed the guardians, and that this accounts
for the blood-red coloring of the remaining stones. Whatever the truth of the matter, Korash Khaar
was no more, and the pass was abandoned.

Over the course of millennia, many different
groups took shelter in the ruins of Korash Khaar.
Savage [[goblin]]s fought over the bloodstained stones.
The goblins were driven out by [[gnoll]]s, who in turn
lost the land to [[ogre]]s and [[oni]] during the [[Borunan]]
Exodus. The ogres abandoned it, and the tales of
this time speak of ruddy [[gargoyle]]s emerging from
the stone and a darkness rising from beneath
the town. Following this, the haunted ruins were
shunned... until the coming of the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]]. The tales say that it was [[Sora Teraza]] who found [[Xorchylic]], who had been bound beneath Korash
Khaar thousands of years earlier. The project was
entrusted to the [[mind flayer]], and he was given an
army with which to work. A number of the old [[goblin]]
buildings were restored, while others were stripped
for their stone and rebuilt. Quarries were quickly
established, and [[ogre]]s hauled great blocks of stone to
feed the appetite of the growing town.

!!! Architecture and Appearance

Graywall is a town built with the strength of [[ogre]]s, designed by the shared vision of [[Xorchylic]] and the [[medusa]] [[stoneshaper]]s of [[Cazhaak Draal]]. Most buildings
are functional structures of bare granite. But as one walks past the plain stone, it appears to ripple and flow in peripheral vision—the result of strange textures designed by Xorchylic. This subliminal patterning produces a noticeable emotional response in sentient beings. A traveler finds that she feels a slight touch of dread when she steps into an alley, while the open square feels pleasant and peaceful. Locations are identified by simple, iconic images; many of the inhabitants of Graywall cannot read, and only the basic icons work for the more dimwitted residents.

Graywall is built atop a network of tunnels, and many buildings have at least one level that lies underground. Some of these subterranean passages connect all the way to the region known as [[Khyras]], but these passages are typically warded or blocked off; nonetheless, a group of adventurers might find a hidden passage to the Deep Door, or break into a building by coming up from Khyras.

Most of Graywall is designed to accommodate monsters of all shapes and sizes. The arch of a doorway is large enough for a [[troll]] to step through without squeezing. Some buildings have a second door for [[goblin]]s or [[kobold]]s; others place a hatch in the main door, with a leather curtain draped down to keep out the weather.
Any sort of public room includes stools and chairs in a variety of sizes, as well as skins along the floor for larger creatures to sit upon. Public buildings are likely to have high ceilings and a few perches set up along the walls—posts for [[harpies|harpy]] and [[gargoyle]]s.

!! Districts of Graywall

Graywall is divided into four districts, along with two areas that are not part of the town but might play a role in adventures.

* [[Bloodstone]]
* the [[Calabas]]
* [[Little Graywall]]
* the [[Karda]]<br/><br/>
* the [[Stone Pits]]
* [[Khyras]]

!! Forces within Graywall

Many factions are at work in Graywall. Although
the [[Daughters|Daughters of Sora Kell]] forged [[Droaam]] into a nation, tribal
and racial ties are still a powerful force within the
town. Ambitious [[warlord]]s such as [[Tzaryan Rrac]] or
the [[Queen of Stone]] might have their own operatives
in the town. And then there are the spies, [[Brelish|Breland]]
bandits, and groups of deserters or war criminals
drawn from across [[Khorvaire]]. Here are descriptions
of a few organizations, but this is just the tip of the
iceberg.

* the [[Flayer Guard]]
* House [[Tharashk]] (under Viceroy [[Kundran Torrn]])
* the [[Redcaps]]
* the [[Old Bones]]
* the [[Skinners]]
* the [[Swords of Liberty]] (under [[Tars Faldren]])
