        "text": "“[[Cornerstone]]” is a district in [[Middle Tavick's Landing]]. “''The Cornerstone''” is the\nmassive arena in that district. The Cornerstone holds a wide variety of sporting events, ranging from foot races to equine jousts and [[skyblade]] matches. When circuses come to town, they often perform in the\nCornerstone arena. The Cornerstone is considerably\nmore respectable than the [[Hollow Tower]] of [[Hareth's Folly]], and the competitors are generally nobles or celebrities; you can't come in off the street and expect\nto participate in a race at the Cornerstone.\n\nThe ''Stone Trees'' is a small offshoot arena of the Cornerstone and is the one formal\n[[hrazhak]] forum in [[Sharn]]. There is a considerable\n[[shifter]] population in the district, and over the centuries these crafters and merchants raised a considerable sum to invest in the arena. While it is far smaller\nthat the Cornerstone, it has an extremely versatile\ndesign, allowing different configurations of obstacles\nto be set up for each match. These obstacles include\nunusual metal and stone sculptures designed to mimic\ntrees—hence the name of the arena.",
