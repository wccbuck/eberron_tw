        "text": "The Gyrderi are a legend of the [[Tairnadal]] elves. The [[Keepers of the Past|Spirits of the Past]] say that when the [[giant]]s enslaved the ancestors of the Tairnadal, a few wise and stealthy elves escaped by making powerful alliances with the forces of nature. Over the course of centuries, these\nelves, now called Gyrderi, developed a [[druid]]ic tradition, becoming direct vessels of the power of the wild. When the elf uprising began, the Gyrderi aided the first of the Tairnadal and were instrumental in their earliest victories. However, the giants of the [[Sulat League]] studied the Gyrderi and found a way to counter the druids: the giants enacted a terrible curse that forever bound them in the [[wild shape]]s they were wearing, trapping them and their descendants in the forms of animals.\n\nAccording to the tales, the Gyrderi continued to fight alongside the [[Tairnadal]], and the first ancestors of the famed [[Valenar warhorse|Valenar beast]]s were in fact Gyrderi [[druid]]s. These mystical creatures are also the source of the Tairnadal tradition of natural magic, especially the strong [[ranger]] tradition found within the culture. Over the course of generations, the Gyrderi animals the Tairnadal brought out of [[Valenar]] lost the full intelligence of their ancestors. However, some believe that true Gyrderi still exist in the depths of [[Xen'drik]] as sapient animals possessing powerful [[druidic magic|primal magic]]. Perhaps adventurers can find the truth of these legends.",
