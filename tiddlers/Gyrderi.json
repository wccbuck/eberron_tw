        "text": "The Gyrderi are a legend of the [[Tairnadal]] elves. The\n[[Keepers of the Past|Spirits of the Past]] say that when the [[giant]]s enslaved\nthe ancestors of the Tairnadal, a few wise and stealthy\nelves escaped by making powerful alliances with the\nforces of nature. Over the course of centuries these\nelves, now called Gyrderi, developed a [[druid]]ic tradition, becoming direct vessels of the power of the wild. When the elf uprising began, the Gyrderi aided\nthe first of the Tairnadal and were instrumental in\ntheir earliest victories. However, the giants of the\n[[Sulat League]] studied the Gyrderi and found a way to\ncounter the druids: the giants enacted a terrible curse\nthat forever bound them in the [[wild shape]]s they were\nwearing, trapping them and their descendants in the\nforms of animals.\n\nAccording to the tales, the Gyrderi continued to\nfight alongside the [[Tairnadal]], and the first ancestors\nof the famed [[Valenar warhorse|Valenar beast]]s were in fact Gyrderi\n[[druid]]s. These mystical creatures are also the source of\nthe Tairnadal tradition of natural magic, especially the\nstrong [[ranger]] tradition found within the culture. Over the course of generations, the Gyrderi animals the Tairnadal brought out of [[Valenar]] lost the full intelligence of\ntheir ancestors. However, some believe that true Gyrderi\nstill exist in the depths of [[Xen'drik]] as sapient animals\npossessing powerful [[druidic magic|primal magic]]. Perhaps adventurers\ncan find the truth of these legends.",
