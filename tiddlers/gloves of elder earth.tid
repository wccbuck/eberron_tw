These heavy elbow-length gloves are made of dark brown leather. Once per day, the wearer can transform their hands and forearms into large stone fists, chiseled with arcane runes and geometric designs. When in this form, the wearer is capable of performing feats of incredible strength and throwing devastating punches. The form persists for up to 10 minutes.
