Once a thriving [[Cyran|Cyre]] town, Lyrenton is a ruin on
the very edge of the [[Mournland]]. It's shunned by the
[[Ghaal'dar]], who believe it to be cursed. Any who visit the place are said to
quickly fall prey to a wasting disease. At night, a terrible wailing that echoes among the ruins can be heard for miles across the plains.
