Among the oldest pubs in\n[[Upper Dura]], the Drunken Dragon is a long-time\nfavorite of explorers, adventurers, and privateers.\nSlow service and poor food aside, the Drunken\nDragon has one of the widest selections of exotic\nalcoholic beverages in [[Sharn]]. From [[Mror|Mror Holds]] ale and\n[[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] mead to the [[orc]]ish hrak of the [[Shadow Marches]] and fermented honey-milk brewed by the\n[[shifter]]s of the [[Eldeen Reaches]], if it's strong and\nstrange it can be found at the Drunken Dragon.\n\nThe Dragon has become one of the main places\nto hire adventurers; if a party has no specific agenda\nand simply hopes to find work, it could do worse\nthan to have a few drinks at the Drunken Dragon.\nThe Dragon is a tavern as opposed to an inn, but it\ndoes have two private rooms that parties can use when\ndiscussing secret business or important deals.\n\nThe Drunken Dragon is owned by [[Hascal d'Ghallanda]],\na cheerful middle-aged [[halfling]].",
