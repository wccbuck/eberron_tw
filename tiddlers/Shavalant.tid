Affectionately known as “[[Tribex|tribex]] Town,” Shavalant lies at the center of a vast array of ranches in the business of raising plains tribex, riding tribex, and a wide range of other livestock. The center of Shavalant may be a single cobbled roadway and seven dusty cross-streets, but its wealth is scattered across the surrounding half-million acres of gently rolling grasslands; ranchers 20 miles away from the town center still consider themselves to be part of Shavalant. Located around Tenneth Ford, the only easy crossing point along the [[Shavalsine River]] as it flows from the [[Ranruunwood|Whitehorn Wood]] to [[Silver Lake]], Shavalant was the logical stopping point for ranchers bringing their stock to [[Orcbone]] or the trade road from [[Xandrar]].

The stockyards of Shavalant are one of House [[Vadalis]]’s key  holdings. ''The Farm'' is the [[dragonmarked house]]'s largest [[enclave]] in [[Breland]]; in addition to livestock, the Farm also breeds war beasts, including [[Breland]]’s famed [[dire bears|dire beast]]. House [[Vadalis]] effectively rules the town, since its designated representative consistently wins election as village spokesperson, and almost everyone in the town works for the house in some capacity. This doesn’t prevent the people of Shavalant from being proudly Brelish; most believe that their work strengthens both the house and their nation, and they see House Vadalis as a positive force in the world.
