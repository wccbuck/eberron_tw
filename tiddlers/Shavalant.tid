''Population:'' <<ntls>>

The center of Shavalant may be a single cobbled roadway and seven dusty cross-streets, but its wealth is scattered across the surrounding 150 miles of gently rolling grasslands. Springing up around Tenneth Ford, the only easy crossing point along the [[Shavalsine River]] as it flows from the [[Ranruunwood|Whitehorn Wood]] to
[[Silver Lake]], Shavalant was the logical stopping point
for ranchers bringing their stock to [[Orcbone]] or the
trade road from [[Xandrar]].

The stockyards of Shavalant are one of House
[[Vadalis]]â€™s key holdings. The [[dragonmarked house]] effectively rules the town, since its designated representative consistently wins election as village spokesperson.
