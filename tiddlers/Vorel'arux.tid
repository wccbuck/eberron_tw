Near the center of the [[Tapestry]] of [[Argonnessen]] is Vorel'arux, the Valley of Beauty. In this haven of intelligence and free thought, [[dragon]]s of all colors intermix to share their ideas and conduct research. Vorel’arux is aesthetically pleasing, but
its true beauty comes from its community of cooperation
and tolerance.

A 60-foot-tall white stone wall circles Vorel’arux. Dragons fly over the wall with ease, but landbound creatures find it contains no doors or openings of any kind. Although it is
not a permanent residence, at least a dozen dragons can be found in the Valley. The sun reflects off their scales, bouncing multicolored patches onto the wall and buildings of Vorel’arux.
