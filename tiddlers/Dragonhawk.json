        "text": "Not all of the\n[[Seven Stones|Ninth Wands]] [[wizard]]s of [[Arcanix]] were executed at the end of the [[Last War]]. The greatest\namong them was a woman named Elira Dawn. Elira is\none of the most gifted wizards Arcanix has produced,\nand she is a protégé of one of [[Khorvaire]]'s greatest wizards: [[Mordain the Fleshweaver]]. When Mordain Phiarlan of the [[Twelve]]\nlearned of her scheduled execution, he contacted\nMinister [[Adal|Adal ir'Wynarn]] and provided a remarkable [[simulacrum]]\nof Elira. Adal approved of the work Elira had done\nfor her country, and with his help the simulacrum\nwas executed instead. Elira established a new life in [[Stormreach]]. To this day, she studies the ancient works\nof the [[giant]]s and other powerful forces, waiting for the\ncall to return to her beloved homeland.\n\n[[Adal|Adal ir'Wynarn]] sent the [[Ninth Wands]] to [[Stormreach]] to serve\nElira. Only their commander, [[Jorian Thiel]], knows the\ntrue identity of this woman they have been sent to protect. The others know Elira only as the Dragonhawk. They know that she is engaged in secret work on behalf\nof their nation, but most assume that she is simply an\n[[Arcanix]] researcher studying the [[Age of Giants]].\n\nElira spends most of her time in an [[extradimensional mansion|magnificent mansion]]. She moves the entrance around\naccording to a schedule; [[Jorian|Jorian Thiel]] knows where to find\nher, but the entrance is difficult for her enemies to\ntrack. Many people in [[Khorvaire]] would like to see\nher dead—not the least of which are King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]]\nof [[Breland]] and Queen [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]] of [[Aundair]]. Along\nwith [[Hassalac Chaar]], she is one of the most\npowerful spellcasters in [[Stormreach]]. However, thanks\nto her many enemies, she spends little time in public\nand rarely exercises her remarkable talents. It’s up\nto the GM to decide what discoveries she has made\nover the last fifteen years; does she have a vault\nof terrifying weapons ready for use when the war\nbegins anew?",
