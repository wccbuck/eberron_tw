The [[doppelganger]] Zaz maintains the shrine dedicated to the [[Traveler]] hidden in the basement of the [[Cracked Mirror]] in [[Callestan]], [[Sharn]]. While Zaz gets along well with the [[Tyrants]], her true loyalty lies with the [[Cabinet of Faces]], the mysterious cult of the [[Traveler]] hidden in the shadows of [[Khorvaire]]. She generally helps the Tyrants, but she often sets her own bizarre schemes in motion.
