In addition to providing space for quiet reflection and meditation, each\npark features a shrine to one of the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]]. Folk of\nthe city often choose a number of shrines for meditation,\nmany making a regular progress through the city to pay\nfealty to each in turn.\n\nThe enormous park known as the Dragon Green\ncontains shrines to all fifteen Sovereigns, and is specifically designed to allow [[dragon]]s to join the city folk in celebrations, lectures, and other public events. Additionally, the [[Union of the Shield]] uses the Dragon Green as its primary training grounds, and tournaments of skill are scheduled here weekly. Such fairs are a combination of a typical combat or spellcasting competition and a tournament arcane. Lethal force is not only\ntolerated but actively encouraged in such events, with defeated combatants [[raised|raise dead]] in short order.\n\nCharacters new to [[Io'lokar]] should expect an invitation to a tournament as a means of demonstrating their worth and skill. Refusal is a grave insult, and news of this insult will spread through the city. Victory in a tournament is a good way to gain status, however, improving dispositions within the city for one week.",
