title: dried leech ammunition
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This ammunition (arrow, crossbow bolt, sling bullet, etc) is made from a leech which has been magically desiccated and imbued with a mote of animating magic. When it is launched from a projectile weapon and strikes a living creature, the leech springs to life and sinks its teeth into the target, draining its blood. The leech remains latched on for up to a minute before falling off, or sooner if it is pulled off. Once the leech is no longer attached to its target, it dies and is no longer magical.
