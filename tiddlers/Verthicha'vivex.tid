type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Mountain of Victory is the primary fortress of the [[Light of Siberys]]. [[Giants|giant]] and [[dwarves|dwarf]] toil ceaselessly in the forges, while [[dragon]]s
study the arts of war. Individual lairs scattered across
the mountain provide dragons with an opportunity for
solitude, but in times of danger, the fortress supports
hundreds of dragons. [[Eldritch machine|eldritch machine]]s produce endless food and water, and the fortress walls are hardened against attack and shielded against [[scrying]]. This fortress is the work of one hundred thousand years of constant innovation; if the GM can think of an interesting defense, the dragons have surely already added it to Verthichaâ€™vivex.
