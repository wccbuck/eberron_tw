They operate out of the fortress of [[Turakbar's Fist]].\n\nThe Blood Horns are the largest of the [[minotaur]] clans, and are among the most brutal and belligerent. Many of the victims of Kor'mur raids are brutally sacrificed\nto slake the blood thirst of the [[overlord]] of [[minotaur]]s.\n[[Turakbar|Rhesh Turakbar]] and his clan are said to wield [[demon]]ic\npower bestowed by their dark lord. They believe the [[Horned King|Tol Kharash]]'s favored servants are the [[goristro]]s, and file their teeth to jagged points to better resemble them.\n\nWhen the hostilities between [[Breland]] and [[Droaam]] were at their height, [[Rhesh Turakbar]] led raids deep into Brelish territory, sowing terror and burning supplies. Today the Blood Horns primarily patrol the border between Droaam and Breland, but they also continue to raid into Breland. They generally remain north of [[Graywall]], avoiding the main trade road—but anything else is fair game. They rarely actually take anything in their raids, and they often wound or maim victims rather than killing them; their goal is fear, not plunder. The [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] say that these raids are [[Breland]]’s fault, both for settling too far west and for refusing to include [[Droaam]] in the [[Treaty of Thronehold]]. ",
