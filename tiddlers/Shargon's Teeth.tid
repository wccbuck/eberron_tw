Throughout the [[Thunder Sea]], vast spires of stone and coral rise up from
the bottom of the ocean—in some cases, over a mile in height. Some reach the surface, while other clusters lie hundreds of feet below it. While these spires formed naturally, they’re often interspersed with a more dangerous—and unnatural—substance. [[Demonglass|demonglass]] is similar to obsidian, but virtually
indestructible. These demonglass spires—commonly called
“needle teeth”—can pierce the hull of a swiftly moving ship
despite being just a few inches in width. The spires in this
region were created by the [[Lurker in Shadow]] during the [[First War|Age of Demons]] (though it wasn’t responsible for the demonglass found
elsewhere in Eberron, such as [[Ashtakala]] in the [[Demon Wastes]]).

The region known as Shargon’s Teeth— a [[Common]]
adaptation of the [[Sahuagin]] name for the [[Devourer]]—lies directly
between [[Sharn]] and [[Stormreach]], and is the most infamous
manifestation of these hazardous needle teeth. Stone spires
and [[demonglass]] spikes of all sizes are scattered between this
chain of islands. Only the most seasoned navigators can plot a
course through the Teeth without the help of a [[sahuagin]] guide;
as a result, the islands have long been a haven for smugglers
and pirates, preying on ships that founder on the Teeth.

In Shargon's Teeth and throughout the [[Thunder Sea]], needle teeth are a dangerous hazard for those who stray from the established trade routes—but they also provide an opportunity to interact with creatures of the sea. Any number of aquatic [[monstrosities|monstrosity]] may make a lair in the upper reaches of a spire. The [[sahuagin]] also often colonize the larger teeth, carving tunnels throughout a spire. High teeth thus serve as outposts projecting up to the upper waters where light can reach, allowing travelers to visit a sahuagin outpost without having to descend to the absolute depths.
