Here, it's always night, and the servants of the Keeper\nof Secrets sing paeans to the moons as they perform bloody\nsacrifices and trace eldritch symbols in the soil. The tower holds\na library of dark secrets, and beside it, a scriptorium where\n[[fiend]]s scribe the books of shadows that may be given to mortal\nwarlocks. Beneath the city of [[Ashtakala]] in the [[Demon Wastes]]\nlies a portal to the Tower of Shadows, and the [[rakshasa]] [[Hektula]]\ndwells here when she's not tending to the library of Ashtakala.\n\nThe Tower of Shadows has the //Universal Understanding// property of [[Syrania]] and the //Eternal Shadows// property of [[Mabar]].
