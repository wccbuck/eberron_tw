        "text": "Saeria is an [[elven|elf]] [[lich]] of the [[Grim Lords]] from the island of [[Farlnen]]. In 545 YK, she formed the //Talons of Ice//, a cabal of necromancers who spread fear and death across the [[Five Nations]]. Initial success made her overconfident, and she was defeated by an alliance of [[templar]]s of the [[Silver Flame]] and soldiers of [[Karrnath]]. While her followers were destroyed, no one knew where to find the lich’s phylactery—so killing her would simply allow her to return elsewhere.\n\nSaeria has been chained to the wall of a deep cell in [[Dreadhold]] for over four hundred years. She does not require food or water, and as a result she has had no contact with living beings since she was imprisoned.",
