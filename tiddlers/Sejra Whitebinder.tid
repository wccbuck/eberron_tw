//"To ignore even one of our divine Sovereigns is to ignore a part of the world before you. I serve all the Sovereigns with equal zeal, and thus does the world itself bend to my needs."//

Sejra Whitebinder, the "Demon-Bane Priest," is a [[cleric]] of the [[Sovereign Host]] who is renowned for defeating the [[demon]] Ravan-Eth several years ago in the wilds of [[Breland]]. She firmly believes that the Sovereigns are present in all aspects of life. While she considers herself a priest first and a
warrior second, she is devoted to protecting the faithful
and the priesthood of the Sovereign Host.
