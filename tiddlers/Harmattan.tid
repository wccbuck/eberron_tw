<div align="right">—Harmattan, speaking to a fellow [[warforged]]</div>

Harmattan is one of the most powerful and devoted agents of the [[Lord of Blades]], the mysterious messianic entity who seeks to forge a new future for all [[warforged]]. Towering at a height of nine feet with the build of an [[ogre]], Harmattan is an imposing figure. At a distance, he appears to be garbed in glinting chainmail beneath a flowing cloak, but closer inspection reveals his true form.

Harmattan's body is composed of thousands of floating fragments of metallic detritus: broken armor, shattered blades, arrowheads, and splinters of steel too small to be identified. He has no frame or skeleton—just a mass of metal held together by magic. Even his cloak is an extension of his body, a curtain of metal shards held aloft by invisible force. Atop Harmattan's shoulders floats his head, which appears too small for his body; in fact, it's the head of a standard-sized [[warforged]], made of blackened [[adamantine]]. His head is typically surrounded by a cloud of powdered steel, revealing only his glowing red eyes. 

!! Abilities and Followers

As the result of Harmattan's unique form, he can shrug off almost any attack, reforming his body as chips of metal flow like sand to fill any wound he suffers. He is also able to explode into a whirlwind of razor-sharp metal fragments, tearing into creatures of flesh and leaving their corpses mangled beyond recognition. When he coalesces back into a semisolid humanoid form, he sends a rattling shiver through his body, scattering blood and bits of flesh to the ground.

Harmattan is also undeniably charismatic. His hissing, metallic voice seems to emanate from all directions, and it possesses an almost hypnotic quality, reminiscent of waves on a beach at night. Harmattan's aura of mystery, power, and conviction inspires a fierce loyalty in his followers. They see him as proof of the divine potential of their kind, and believe he can lead the [[warforged]] race to true immortality.

Two notable underlings of Harmattan are [[Indigo]] and [[Hydra]].

!! Harmattan's Creation

Harmattan was created in the Blacklion [[Cannith]] [[forgehold]], originally named "Fourth." He fought in the [[Last War]] as a soldier, but was destroyed in a fierce battle. Through sheer force of will, Harmattan rebuilt himself from surrounding metal fragments in a web of magical force, resulting in the flowing form he has today.
