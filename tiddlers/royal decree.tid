title: royal decree
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When the head of a royal family or ruler of a nation makes an official proclamation, word is spread by disseminating a royal decree. This is a large, ornately decorated parchment detailing the announcement in clear, easy-to-read script. Royal decrees are read in town squares, reproduced in printed [[chronicles|newspaper]], and hung on the walls of government buildings and other places where people gather. During the [[Last War]], royal decrees were issued whenever a decisive battle was fought, when allegiances shifted, and when the [[Thronehold Accords|Treaty of Thronehold]] were signed. These days, royal decrees are used to announce births and deaths in the royal family, changes in tax policies, or other matters of state. Although there is no monetary value attached to the documents, some people save royal decrees of historic or personal importance.

Royal decrees cannot be purchased and are difficult to forge for any useful purpose. The issuance of a royal decree is typically a matter of such public notice that it would be hard to present a forged decree as authentic without the accompanying rumors, anticipation, and officious goings-on.
