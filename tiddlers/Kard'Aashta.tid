type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Guildmaster Kard[['Aashta]] of the [[Liondrake's Roar]] manages the branch's recent [[outpost|Liondrake's Roar Sylbaran Outpost]] in [[Sylbaran]]. She is still completing the work on the outpost and building up her staff; primarily it serves as a way station for mercenaries passing through town. However, Kard’Aashta has many contacts in [[Droaam]]—including friends in [[Turakbar's Fist]] and the [[Great Crag]]—and can be a useful source of information for adventurers planning to travel west of the [[Border Road]]. While she’s interested in making a profit, Kard’Aashta truly does want to help normalize relations between Droaamites and the people of the east, and will often encourage the mercenaries in residence to accompany her to town revels or to the [[Sylvan|Sylvan (theater)]].
