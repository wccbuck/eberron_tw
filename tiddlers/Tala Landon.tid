Tala Landon is one of the five members of the [[Sylbaran]] town council. While she respects the [[Warden|Wardens of the Wood]] traditions, Tala says that she hears the voice of [[Kol Korran]] and [[Onatar]] urging her to do moreâ€”to be ever vigilant for new opportunities that could help Sylbaran prosper. With this in mind, she is often interested in talking to adventurers who could help her with her latest vision.
