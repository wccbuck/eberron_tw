        "text": "Of all the inns in [[Stormreach]], one of the most popular among adventuring parties is the Ship’s Cat. A tangle of [[densewood]] twigs that have been thatched together, the Ship’s Cat is run by [[Harysh]], who has a reputation for honor, hospitality, fairness, and discretion. This makes her a valued intermediary for many. The inn\ntakes its name from Harysh’s dozen cats, which share\nthe place with guests. [[Familiars|familiar]] and animal companions receive excellent care at the inn, as long as they do not raise the resident cats’ hackles.\n\nFew adventurers would patronize the place if they learned the truth about its proprietor, [[Harysh]].",
