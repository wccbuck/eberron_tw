        "text": "King Boranel ir'Wynarn, who has ruled [[Breland]] since 961 YK, leads the royal family of Breland from an ancient estate in the capital city of [[Wroat]]. Older than the other rulers of the [[Five Nations]] and with heirs that have as yet not inspired love and devotion, Boranel worries about\nthe fate of Breland when his head finally becomes too weak\nto carry the crown.\n\nAn adventurer before his ascension, Boranel traveled\ntwice to [[Xen'drik]] in his youth. During the [[Last War]],\nthe king won hearts and minds by leading sorties\nagainst enemy forces. He personally defeated an [[ogre]]\nchieftain while his people in the west retreated across\nthe [[Graywall Mountains]] to escape the brimming violence of savage [[Droaam]].\n\n[[Breland]] loves its king, and\nthe people would follow him just about anywhere.\nThe same, however, cannot be said of his children.\nBoranel's heirs have not shown the king's impressive\nleadership abilities, and many Brelish worry about\nwhat the future holds. The idealistic believe that whoever takes the throne next will grow to fill the crown's\ndemands, but not all are so sure. There's even talk of\ndissolving the monarchy and giving full power to the\nparliament once Boranel dies.",
