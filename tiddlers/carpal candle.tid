type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This candle is affixed to the skeletal hand of a dead
necromancer. When lit, the candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius, and dim
light for an additional 5 feet. The light lasts 1 hour and is
''only visible to you''.

Once you have used this property, it can't be used again
until the next dawn.
