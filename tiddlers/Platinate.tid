Platinate, among [[Sharn]]'s most desirable residential districts, isn't as exclusive as [[Mithral Tower]]
in [[Upper Central]], but certainly compares to [[Oak Towers]] and [[Crystal Bridge]] in [[Upper Northedge]].
[[Morgrave University]] produces few scholars wealthy
enough to live in Platinate, but some retired
explorers who struck it rich selling artifacts from
[[Xen'drik]] settled in this district to remain close to
the University. There are just enough eccentric
collectors of antiquities and retired adventurers to
give Platinate a quirky character that distinguishes
it from similar districts.
