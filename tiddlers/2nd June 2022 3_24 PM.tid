Starilaskur is a relatively young city compared to others in central [[Khorvaire]]. It was only established about 400 years ago, and did not expand into a city until after the invention of the [[lightning rail]], as its manifest zone's effects were not well understood until late in [[Galifar]]'s history. It is a manufacturing hub (primarily textiles, pottery, glass, and [[magic item]]s), and also has processing centers for sugar and tobacco.

Take inspiration from Bradford, UK

Aqueducts carry water from the cliffs to the southeast. A river also flows from the cliffs into [[Lake Brey]], but it is split into thousands of shallow runnels, most of which lie outside the city walls. Yellow clay is harvested from the runnels and fired into the bricks that make up many buildings, and "runnelberries" are a popular tart fruit that grow amongst the brooks.
