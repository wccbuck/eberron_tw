type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Stormreach]]’s most infamous ward, Locksmith Square
is home to many of the city’s more colorful and popular
attractions. The [[Marketplace]] is the hub of activity during
the day, but Locksmith Square takes over at night.
Although other districts, such as [[Respite]] and the [[Temple District]], offer good food or an evening’s entertainment,
many sailors, laborers, and adventurers would rather
spend their leisure time near the [[Red Ring]], where the
atmosphere is riotous and the prices are low.

Many craftspeople maintain shops here, from cobblers to locksmiths. The ward’s name arose in the modern city’s early days when the Kandars, a family of dwarf
locksmiths who curried favor with the [[Amanatu family]],
established their business by the great silver walls.
