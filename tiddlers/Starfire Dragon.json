        "text": "The Starfire Dragon offers a\nsteady diet of entertainment accompanied by exquisite meals. In this case, however, the entertainment clearly takes a back seat to the food. Trying to compete in a crowded market, the Starfire Dragon's\nowner, Amman Todav ([[human]]), has hired excellent cooks, and the\nrestaurant's menu offerings reflect the trouble he\nhas gone to. Todav's choice in entertainers is less\ndiscriminating, however; he lost a good portion of\nhis hearing fighting in the [[Last War]], and judges performers more on their looks than the quality of their\nperformances. On a good night, the entertainment\nranks with the best [[Middle Menthis]] has to offer.\nBut the Starfire Dragon is gaining a reputation for\nshowcasing a great number of beautiful women with\nmediocre singing voices.",
