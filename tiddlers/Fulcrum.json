        "text": "The [[monk]]s of the Fulcrum meditate on the\nbalance of the [[plane]]s, contemplating the delicate\narray of forces that underlie reality. The order\nwas founded in [[Zilargo]], and its roots are closely\ntied to the [[elemental binding]] industry. The\nmasters of the Fulcrum believe that industrial\nbinding carries the risk of disrupting the\nplanar balance, and that the devotions of the\nFulcrum serve as a counterbalance and prevent\ncatastrophes.\n\nThrough their devotions, monks of the\nFulcrum learn to channel powerful [[elemental]]\nforces. Rather than being part of the natural\nworld, these powers are drawn from the [[plane]]s,\nand the energies of [[Fernia]], [[Risia]] and [[Lamannia]]\nflow through the Fulcrum monk. Most members of the order use such energies in abstract ways, acting purely to maintain the balance of elemental energies within the world. Others focus on the martial potential of these powers, sheathing their fists in fire and skin in stone.\n\nThe Fulcrum isnâ€™t a religious order, but its members are concerned with anything that could disrupt the balance of the [[plane]]s and are especially interested in solving the mystery of the [[Mourning]].
