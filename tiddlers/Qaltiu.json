        "text": "The Qaltiu (or Qaltiar) [[drow]] of [[Xen'drik]] are one of the four main Scorpion Nations of the [[Vulkoori]]. Their name translates to \"Broken Oath,\" and the stories of [[Vulkoor]] the Hunter teach his children that there is no shame in breaking a bad deal. The Qaltiu are also taught to meet all obstacles with the stealth and patience of the scorpion—an approach which has bolstered their reputation as the greatest hunters and trackers among the [[drow]]. Their mighty [[scorpion wraith]] champions are legendary.\n\nWhile the Qaltiu revere the [[Scorpion God|Vulkoor]] like all the [[Vulkoori]], they also place great importance on specific [[primal spirits|fey]]—entities which some scholars believe may be [[archfey]] of [[Thelanis]]. These include ''Hul'drac'', the Shifting Panther, a cunning [[displacer beast]] hunter; ''Kura'tra'', the Fleeting Wonder, the [[tilxin]] which represents impermanent joy; ''Ko'molaq'', the Teller of Tales, the immense two-headed [[dream serpent]] who possesses knowledge of hidden things; and a host of other creatures.\n\nSome Qaltiu have dedicated themselves to the task of hunting and eliminating all [[giant]]s from the continent, and even from [[Eberron]] as a whole—a slow and patient campaign of total revenge for the crimes of the ancient titans.",
