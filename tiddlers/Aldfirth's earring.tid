type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This earring grants the wearer the ability to cast three random [[arcane|arcane magic]] [[cantrip|spell]]s, even if the wearer isn't a spellcaster. The cantrips vary from person to person but never change for an individual who was [[attuned|attunement]] to the item at one point in the past. Once each spell has been cast, that spell can't be cast again until the following dawn.
