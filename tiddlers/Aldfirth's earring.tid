title: Aldfirth's earring
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This earring grants the wearer the ability to cast three random [[arcane|arcane magic]] [[cantrip|spell]]s, even if the wearer isn't a spellcaster. The cantrips vary from person to person but never change for an individual who was attuned to the item at one point in the past. Once each spell has been cast, that spell can't be cast again until the following dawn.
