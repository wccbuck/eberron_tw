title: mirror of infinite transpondence
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

These silver hand mirrors always come in pairs. When activated, a mirror establishes a visual link with its paired mirror for 10 minutes, with the two mirrors acting as opposite sides of the same open window. The mirrors create this connection even if both are on different [[plane]]s.

When a single //mirror of infinite transpondence// is found, the GM decides where its paired mirror is and who possesses it. A random possessor and location can be determined by rolling on the table below.

|! <<dr d8>> |!Location |!Possessor |
| 1 |[[Fairhaven]], [[Aundair]] |[[Thuel Racannoch]], Spy Master of the [[Royal Eyes]] |
| 2 |[[Tzaryan Keep]], [[Droaam]] |[[Tzaryan Rrac]], [[oni]] [[warlord]] |
| 3 |The [[Korranath|Korranath (temple)]], [[Sharn]], [[Breland]] |[[Kalphan Riak]], Platinum Concordian of the [[Aurum]] |
| 4 |[[Sentinel Tower]], [[Karrlakton]], [[Karrnath]] |A [[Deneith]] cultist of the [[Vigilant Eye]] |
| 5 |[[Pylas Talaear]], [[Aerenal]] |An [[elven|elf]] [[wizard]] |
| 6 |A palatial [[dragon]] hoard in the [[Vast]], [[Argonnessen]] |[[Dawnwing]], [[gold dragon]] dominion lord |
| 7 |The [[City of Brass]], [[Fernia]] |Pasha [[Shashraqa]] of Firefall |
| 8 |The [[Immeasurable Market]] of [[Syrania]] |[[Jabra]], [[night hag]] merchant |

Once the connection between the two mirrors has
been activated three times from either end, it canâ€™t be
activated again until the next dawn.
