The group includes [[dragonmark]]ed Lyrandar heirs who can wield their [[Mark of Storm]] as a weapon, blasting their enemies with terrible winds and charging their sabers with crackling lightning (as the spell [[elemental weapon]]). Woe to the [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] pirate who tries his luck against an [[elemental vessel]] only to find a Storm sentry on board.\n\nAgents in the Sheltering Storm often have semi-permanent positions on specific ships, with important cargo assigned according to the sentry guarding it. The Sheltering Storm maintains a small training facility on the island of [[Stormhome]], but sentries more often use general house [[enclave]]s and [[Windwrights Guild]] facilities.",
