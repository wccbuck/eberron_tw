You can channel this blessed armor's magic to cause it to emit a flash of blinding, radiant light. When you do this, all other creatures within 30 feet of you who cannot resist the magic are blinded for up to 10 seconds and suffer [[radiant damage|damage type]]. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
