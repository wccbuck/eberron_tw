The [[Stampede]] [[enclave]] of House [[Vadalis]] in [[Sylbaran]] is run by Myrana d'Vadalis, a tough old woman whose greatest pride is the pair of [[bulette]]s who live on the ranch, which she calls Trundle and Grim. Myrana has been working with these two for years and has established a strong bond with them, but so far the bulettes have never produced young. Myrana will often bring Trundle to local festivals, and allow children to ride the [[monstrosity]].
