//Flesh isn't final: it's clay to be molded into something better. We can be so much more than these bodies we're born with. You were birthed in the prison of everyday life, but there are paths in this foul labyrinth that lead to unimaginable wonders. Let us show you the way.//
<div align="right">—A cultist of Dyrrn</div>

Dyrrn is known to its followers as the Corruptor, the Stealer of Thoughts, the Slithering Lord, and the Foul Labyrinth. In the lore of the [[Gatekeepers]], it is said that Dyrrn plants thoughts in the weak-minded—the seeds of terrible ideas that fester and grow. Those who are particularly brilliant often draw the attention of the Foul Labyrinth, which hungers to consume unique minds.

Dyrrn most often appears as a tall humanoid male with pale skin, clad in a heavy cassock of interwoven black leather that slithers unsettlingly around the daelkyr's form. Dyrrn can extend tentacles from its body, using them to extract the brains of others. Its [[demiplane]] is known as the [[Palace of Sinew]], but it also dwells in the [[Fields of Thought]] in [[Xoriat]].

The [[mind flayer]]s of [[Eberron]] know Dyrrn as the Overmind, and it serves as the cornerstone of their collective consciousness. Of all the [[daelkyr]], the Corruptor is the most adept at twisting minds and bodies to create monsters. It was Dyrrn who turned [[goblinoid]] prisoners into the first [[dolgaunt]]s and [[dolgrim]]s, creating the legions that would savage the nations of [[Khorvaire]]. Dyrrn is also a prolific creator of [[symbiont]]s—treasures that tempt people to bind alien entities to their flesh.

!! Dyrrn's Cults

Dyrrn's lair touches the [[Eldeen Reaches]], and the [[druid]]s of the Towering Wood are always watching for Dyrrn's influence. At the start of the [[Last War]], the dwarves of the [[Mror Holds]] discovered passages to the daelkyr's realm below their halls, and Dyrrn's cults have spread from there.

Mind flayers often work with Dyrrn's cults, many of which are obsessed with evolution—through the use of symbionts or by becoming an [[aberration]]. Those who worship the Stealer of Thoughts believe that Dyrrn will consume all sentient beings, except for its servants.

However, there are other cults—such as the [[Transcendent Flesh]]—who see Dyrrn's
actions in a positive light. Dyrrn transforms and creates new
forms of life—but who are we to decide that these things are
monsters? Such cultists believe that Dyrrn is driving evolution,
and they can transcend their own limits by walking the path of
the Foul Labyrinth. While this can start as simply transactional,
the influence of the Corruptor is insidious, and cultists can
soon start to see natural creatures as vile and weak.

!! Character Ideas

An [[artificer]] could hear Dyrrn's whispers,
guiding them to create living tools; their infusions might appear
to be alive, though their effects are the same as those for other
artificers. A [[warlock]] bound to Dyrrn could experience dramatic
physical transformation or focus on powers that control
thought—are they now a renegade fighting Dyrrn, or being
guided toward evolution? A barbarian could present their rage
as a disturbing physical transformation, while a [[transmuter|transmutation]]
[[wizard]] might follow in [[Mordain the Fleshweaver]]'s footsteps.

!! Adventure Hooks

Dyrrn's cults can always provide a foothold for
[[aberration]]s to enter a story. Cultists could be creating monsters
from corpses, cloning important people and releasing the clones
into the world, or turning innocent people into aberrations. A
[[Transcendent Flesh]] cult might focus on their own physical or mental evolution and have no intention of harming others—until they need extra brains or body parts. Someone might
discover that Dyrrn is responsible for both [[aberrant|aberrant dragonmark]] and true
[[dragonmark]]s; what impact would this have on the world?
