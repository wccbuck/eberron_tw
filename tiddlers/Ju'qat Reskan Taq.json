The Pasha was one of the six great titans who defeated the Fire Prince [[Adaxus]] of the [[Sulat League]]. During the battle, the Pasha sacrificed herself to protect her comrades, but before her soul could pass on to [[Dolurrh]], her patron—a great [[phoenix]] of [[Fernia]]—bound itself to her form, bestowing the titan with the power of resurrection. Thus, any time the Pasha was killed, she would reform in the [[Sea of Fire]] and return to her great palace through a planar gate. Despite this power, the Sultana of All Suns vanished from history after the [[dragon]]s of the [[Light of Siberys]] destroyed giant civilization at the end of the age.",
