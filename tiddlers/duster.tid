While holding this wand, you can instantly clean an area within 10 feet of you that is no larger than 1 cubic foot every three to five seconds, removing dirt and grime. There are many variations of the //duster//; the two-handed //staff of cleansing// covers a five-foot cube in the same amount of time, while the //bright basin// cleans clothing and cloth objects placed within it.
