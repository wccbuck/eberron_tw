''Population:'' <<ntls>>

Known as the City of Night, the Grand Duchy of Atur stands in the shadow of the
[[Ashen Spires]], cloaked in mist from the [[Karrn Falls|Karrn River]]. For all but a few hours each day, Atur lies shrouded in gloom, a nearly perpetual twilight that gives the
city its moniker. Oddly, during the day’s brightest
times, the city is quiet, seemingly deserted. Only at
night does Atur come fully to life.

This atmosphere suits the people. At night, they
frolic in fest halls and taverns, sampling the forbidden
delights of Atur’s infamous bordellos. Even King [[Kaius|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]]
is not immune to the city’s allure, and he finds refuge
in Nighthold, a royal complex where he sometimes
holds court.

Beneath the hustle and bustle of this curious community lie the Vaults of the Dead, where [[Karrnath]]’s [[undead|Karrnathi undead]] legions await the day when war rages anew.
Overlooking the city is the huge [[Crimson Monastery]],
one of the greatest bastions of the [[Blood of Vol]] in the
nation.

The [[True Shapers]], a large [[enclave]] of House [[Thuranni]], is located in Atur, as is the [[Atur Academy]] of [[necromancy]].

!! The Grand Duchy

Atur was the first "palatinate" or grand duchy of [[Galifar]], and as such maintained a degree of independence from the kingdom, allowing them to enforce local laws and practice customs that might be at odds with those of the surrounding kingdom. Today, Atur maintains this status within the nation of [[Karrnath]]. This region’s independence was negotiated long ago in recognition for the work it does in containing the dangerous influence of the powerful [[Mabar]]an [[manifest zone]] at the heart of the region, and was reinforced in agreements with [[Kaius I|Kaius ir'Wynarn I]] in exchange for the support of Atur’s elite [[necromancers|necromancy]]. 

Because of this, Atur remains a public stronghold of the [[Blood of Vol]] even after Regent [[Moranna|Moranna ir'Wynarn]] and [[Kaius III|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] turned against the faith. Atur is still home to the finest [[necromancers|necromancy]] in the nation, and most of [[Karrnath]]’s [[undead troops|Karrnathi undead]] are stored in its vaults. There are warlords who despise the [[Blood of Vol]] or who fear that the undead it maintains could be turned against the nation. But these nobles know that seizing Atur would prove disastrous unless they had the knowledge necessary to contain the power of the [[manifest zone]], and so the City of Night remains inviolate.
