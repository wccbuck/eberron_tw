The great towers\nalso provide landing sites for dragons and other\nflying visitors, and are where any visiting dragons\nlodge while in the city. Beneath the top-level living\nquarters of the [[stone giant]]s lie a series of spacious\ndraconic guest chambers accessed from the outside\ntower walls.\n\nThe [[Arnaaracaex]] keep a constant watch for agents of the dominion lords who openly challenge the city, but for the most part, the [[dragon]]s stopping in [[Io'lokar]] are long-range travelers seeking a safe layover in the [[Vast]]. Such dragons are an excellent source of intelligence and campaign hooks from elsewhere in [[Argonnessen]].\n\nDragons also sometimes come to the city seeking nondragon agents for missions of the [[Chamber]] or individual [[dragon]] lords. The rare [[Io'lokari]] adventurers are particular about the types of assignments they accept, so foreign parties are coveted as heroes for\nhire—especially those willing to be paid in treasure the Io’lokari disdain.",
