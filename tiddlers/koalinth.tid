Koalinths, or "sea [[hobgoblin]]s," are an aquatic [[goblinoid]] race. They resemble hobgoblins in size and appearance, but with green skin and webbed digits. Little else is known about this mysterious people. Small tribes of koalinth may be found in the [[Torlaac Bay]] off the coast of [[Darguun]].
