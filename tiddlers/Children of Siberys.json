        "text": "The Children of [[Siberys]] are a young [[arcane order]] based in [[Arcanix]]. Founded by Provost [[Iria ir'Rayne]] in 989 YK, this organization posits that there may be considerably more latent \"dragonblood [[sorcerer]]s\" in the world than we realize, simply waiting for their powers to be recognized and released. These gifted individuals are imbued with ambient magical power which can be harnessed using techniques and trappings of [[Siberyan|Siberyan Theory]] [[wizard]]ry to harness their power, but they are naturally attuned to specific magical effects, and have enormous potential within this narrow scope. The goal of the Children of Siberys is to find and guide those blessed with dragonblood sorcery, and to study the mystical nature of the Blood of [[Siberys]]. At the moment it’s a small order that lacks resources or influence, but ir’Rayne is fighting to expand the circle.",
