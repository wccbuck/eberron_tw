The temple has a central ''Hall of the Assembled Host'' that seats almost six thousand worshipers. Individual shrines to each of the deities that comprise the\nSovereign Host surround the central hall; [[Arawai]]\nand [[Olladra]]â€™s shrines are particularly large and well-attended. The surrounding buildings provide residences for the acolytes and priests of the temple. In the south part of the ward, a number of vacant buildings emphasize the crumbling emptiness of the abandoned Church of the [[Silver Flame]], [[Old Tira's Mercy]].\n\n!!
