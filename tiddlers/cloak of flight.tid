title: cloak of flight
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While wearing this cloak, you can speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word. The wings allow you to fly at a speed of up to 20 miles per hour. When they disappear, you can't use them again for several hours.
