When Korchan Amanatu failed to claim the crown of [[Krag]], he took his ships south to the [[Thunder Sea]]. Reaving under the sign of the broken crown, the Amanatu pirates were known as the most ruthless killers of the south sea. Korchan would never have accepted peace with [[Galifar]], but he was finally slain on the open seas. His young son [[Yorrick|Yorrick Amanatu]] joined the other [[Storm Lords]], bringing the raw power of the Amanatu reavers to the alliance. Yorrick Amanatu remains a Storm Lord to this day—the sole survivor of the founders, at 260 years old.\n\nThe Amanatu reavers formed the backbone of the original [[Stormreach Guard]], and the Amanatu line is directly responsible for training the Guard and managing the Stormreach Recruiters. Many of the chief recruiters and most capable officers of the Guard are\nLord [[Yorrick|Yorrick Amanatu]]’s children. If the day ever came for a civil war between the [[Storm Lords]], most of the Guard would follow his lead.",
