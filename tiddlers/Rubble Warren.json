        "text": "Stone is rarely quarried in [[Stormreach]], instead being\nrecovered from the ruins. Stone blocks are broken up\nand reused in some places. The Rubble Warren, on\n[[Saltire]]â€™s northern edge, is one. Many street children\nplay in the site, making their own tunnels in the rubble.\nA few of them are dedicated to becoming explorers and\nadventurers and are trying to hone their skills. One\nof these, twelve-year-old Cadroc, is quite capable for his age and leads a small\nband of like-minded children. He might fixate on a PC as an idol; though this behavior could be annoying, Cadroc could be a useful and loyal hireling.",
