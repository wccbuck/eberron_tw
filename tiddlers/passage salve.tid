To activate this salve's effect, you must have the [[Mark of Passage]], though any creature can benefit from its effect.

Used by House [[Orien]] for centuries, this salve can be applied to a human-sized or smaller creature (a process which takes 1 minute) and then activated by a person with the [[dragonmark]] of [[Passage|Mark of Passage]]. The affected creature then enters the [[Ethereal Veil]] for 1 hour.

(See also [[oil of etherealness]], the higher rarity version of this item that does not require a [[dragonmark]].)
