A skulk is a humanoid with soft, leathery light-gray skin, and deep blue pupil-less eyes. They can change the color of their skin to match their surroundings, camouflaging themselves in any environment, even complex or regular patterns like bricks and mortar. They can be found scattered across [[Sarlona]], but can be found in significant numbers in the province of [[Ohr Kaluun]].

Legend says that at the conclusion of the [[Sundering]], the
people of [[Nulakesh]], [[Corvagura]], and [[Pyrine]] joined forces
to battle [[Ohr Kaluun]]. This dark kingdom was already
weakened by civil war, and the forces of the [[Inspired]]
took down the city-states of Ohr Kaluun one by one.
In what seemed to be an act of charity, a Shadow Lord
named Kul Uulan opened his war maze to the refugees of
fallen cities, suggesting that they might still find victory
through unity. The truth was far more macabre. Uulan
sacrificed thousands of refugees in a ghastly ritual calling
for the blessing and protection of the [[Dark Six]]. When the
soldiers of the Riedran Alliance came to Uulan's maze,
they found no trace of his people; even psionic [[scrying]]
proved useless. Soldiers were killed, and word spread
of evil spirits haunting the broken mazes. In time, the
truth came to light. Uulan's people hadn't vanished:
they'd been transformed. Through the blood sacrifice
of thousands of innocents, Uulan had gained a terrible
power for his own people. They had become the skulks.

The skulks of [[Riedra]] believe that they are the
chosen people of the [[Dark Six]], blessed and shielded by
the deities others fear. Although the skulks revere all
of the Six, they typically select one as a personal patron
and seek to emulate that force in all ways. The [[Mockery]]
inspires the most followers, and the skulks who idolize
the flayed god are terrifying indeed. Those skulks who
follow the [[Shadow]] often pursue arcane knowledge; the
most dangerous members of the [[Heirs of Ohr Kaluun]] are often skulk [[wizard]]s. Nonetheless, the skulks have never posed a serious threat to the [[Inspired]]. They are paranoid creatures who revere madness, treachery, and destruction. They have trouble forming large communities, as rivalries and feuds quickly arise, and they tend not to abide the company of other humanoids, even their [[tiefling]] brethren. The skulks love to kill [[Riedrans]]â€”but when there are no Riedrans about, they soon turn on each other.

Although most skulks are content with their savage
life amid the ruins, a few seek something more. Some of
these skulks end up working with the [[Dream Merchants]],
while others simply wander. A few seek to atone for the
dark deeds of their ancestors; it's said that a handful
of skulk guides have been seen on the [[Summit Road]] in
recent years.
