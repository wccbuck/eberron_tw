She owns the [[Oaks]], one of\nthe finest restaurants in [[Sharn]]. Maza is stubborn and\nset in her ways, and she constantly fights to maintain\nthe status quo and uphold tradition; however, she does tend to put the concerns of the wealthy before those of the poor, especially the city [[goblin]]s and other wretched folks of the [[lower ward]]s. While she has the highest regard for the\nlaw, she is in no way na√Øve; she is capable of surprising\nsubterfuge in the best interests of [[Sharn]]. ",
