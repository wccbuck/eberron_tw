        "text": "By the time he was seventeen, Cartha was an assassin\nfor hire, murdering ship hands and wharfmasters in\nthe [[Stormreach]] [[Harbor]] for [[2c|money]] each. Already a natural\nkiller and a valued member of the [[Bilge Rats]], Cartha’s\nnatural tendencies were sharply enhanced when he\nwas infected with [[therianthropy|therianthrope]]. Even though he is an afflicted [[wererat]] rather than a natural therianthrope,\nhis bite is incredibly potent and capable of infecting\nothers, and he quickly used his newfound abilities to\ndominate the Rats.\n\nFew outside the gang know Cartha is a [[wererat]], but\nmany suspect he is no mere human. An oft-recounted\ntale in the [[Harbor]] concerns a night when eight members of the now-defunct Stingrays ambushed Cartha. He left all eight dead, three with their throats torn\nout. Cartha emerged from the fray without a scratch on him.\n\nCartha typically wears a tattered gray cloak and cowl, stained tunic, black sash, at least eight daggers, and a plain ivory ring—a trophy from his first hit.",
