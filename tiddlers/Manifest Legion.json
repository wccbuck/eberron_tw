[[Wandslinger|wandslinger]]s and [[wizard]]s with a focus on [[conjuration]] magic make up the bulk of the company's membership. It is known for summoning [[elemental]]s and even [[fiend]]s during pitched battles to cause chaos among enemy ranks and disrupt cavalry charges. \n\nThe Manifest Legion tends to operate in small units, known as cabals, on the battlefield. \"Earthbound\" units typically include several summoners protected by non-magical bodyguards, while aerial units consist solely of spellcasters, soaring above the battlefield with the [[fly]] spell and raining down missiles of arcane force.\n\nThe Legion is led by a [[Brelish|Breland]] [[gnome]] [[wizard]] named Long Uthar.",
