        "text": "House [[Medani]] secured a contract from the governments of [[Breland]] and\n[[Thrane]] to have its members patrol the periphery of the [[Mournland]] and provide early warning of monsters or strange magical phenomena crossing into\nsettled lands. House [[Medani]] gave the riders a typically circumspect name (the “Western Mournland Working Group”). But after the first patrols came back to civilization with a haunted look in their eyes, the Thrane locals started calling them the “Thousand Yard Stare,” and the name stuck. In the three years that the Thousand Yard Stare has been watching the border of the Mournland, its members have provided\nearly warning of everything from strangely twisted [[giant]]s on the march to [[living spell]]s spinning out of control. But the Thousand Yard Stare can’t be everywhere, so the dangers of the Mournland sometimes cross the [[Brey River]] or the [[dead-gray mists]].\n\nThe Thousand Yard Stare is led by [[Channara d'Medani]].",
