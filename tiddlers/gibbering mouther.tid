title: gibbering mouther
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A gibbering mouther's body is an amorphous mass of mouths and eyes that propels itself by oozing forward, fastening several mouths to the ground and pulling its bulk behind. Though it moves slowly, it swims through water, mud, and quicksand with ease.

When a gibbering mouther senses prey, its mouths begin to murmur and chatter, each with a different voice: deep or shrill, wailing or ululating, crying out in agony or ecstasy. This cacophonous gibbering overcomes the senses of any creature that hears it, causing most to flee in terror. Others are overcome with madness or stand paralyzed, fixated on the horrific creature as it oozes forward to consume them. 

Driven to devour any creature it can reach, a gibbering mouther flows over victims transfixed by its mad ranting, its multitudinous voices temporarily silenced as it gnaws and swallows living flesh. The monster liquefies stone with which it comes into contact, hindering creatures that overcome its gibbering and attempt to flee.

A gibbering mouther leaves nothing of its prey behind. However, even as the last of a victim's body is consumed, its eyes and mouth boil to the surface, ready to join the chorus of tormented gibbering that welcomes the monster's next meal.

Gibbering mouthers are immune to any spell or effect that would alter their form. Some particularly powerful gibbering mouthers can infect nearby creatures with a chaotic alteration [[disease]] which can cause the sprouting of extra fingers, flickering in and out of reality, or other alien effects; this disease can be cured with a [[restoration]] spell or similar effect. Some gibbering mouthers can also emit an aura of shifting reality, bringing a small taste of the mutability of [[Xoriat]] to their immediate surroundings.

Gibbering mouthers are created by [[Kyrzin]], the Prince of Slime, and are worshiped by cultists known as [[Whisperers]] or Gibberers, part of a long-standing tradition in the [[Shadow Marches]].
