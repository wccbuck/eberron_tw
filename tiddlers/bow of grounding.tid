type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A stiff but bendable chain makes up the curvature of this longbow. Each link of chain has a small pink pearl in the center.

When you shoot a creature that can fly with this bow, its ability to fly is hampered for the next hour, or longer if the creature doesn't have a chance to rest and recover.
