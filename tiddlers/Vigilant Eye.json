        "text": "The Vigilant Eye is a cult devoted to [[Belashyrra]], which they call the All-Seer. Cult members develop an alien eye on the palm of their non-dominant hand.\nWhen they view the world through this eye, members can see “secrets” about the world around them that feel true—such as seeing certain people are possessed by [[demon]]s or about to commit murder. Members take vigilante action to eliminate the threats “revealed” by their eyes. This cult often takes root in House [[Deneith]] [[enclave]]s or city watch units.",
