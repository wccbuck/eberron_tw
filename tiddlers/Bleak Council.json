        "text": "Each [[Lord of Dust|Lords of Dust]] follows a discrete agenda on behalf of the [[overlord]] that they serve, but even such powerful and singular creatures\nfind it useful to meet in association on occasion. The\nBleak Council (also known as the Council of [[Ashtakala]] or the Bleak Congress) is a collection of the exarchs that serve\nthe imprisoned overlords. Though the Lords of Dust\nare active across [[Eberron]], they make regular pilgrimages to [[Ashtakala]] to exchange news and hone their\ninsidious plans. No more than a few of the Lords of\nDust meet at once, since they are a fractious lot, given\nto treachery and infighting. However, rumors from the\n[[Eldeen Reaches]] have told of a large number of caravans making their way to the [[Demon Wastes]], repelling\nthe [[Wardens of the Wood]] in their efforts to turn them\nback. Are these servants of the [[Lords of Dust]]? If so,\nwhy are they moving now, and why in such numbers?",
