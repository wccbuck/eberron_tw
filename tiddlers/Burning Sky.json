A few islands of rock float amongst the solid\nclouds, but if there's any land below, it's hidden by deadly fog.\nWhile there are skirmishes on the stone islands, most of the\naction occurs in the skies. Winged [[angel]]s and [[fiend]]s circle and\nduel, while [[conscript|manifestation]]s guide [[dragon]]s and other aerial mounts. ",
