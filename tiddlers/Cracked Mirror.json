        "text": "The Cracked Mirror is a quiet, unremarkable inn, notable for the number\nof [[changeling]]s and [[shifter]]s among its clientele. In\nfact, the inn serves as a front for the [[Tyrants]], and\nanyone who wants to do business with the Tyrants\ncan find someone to talk to here. Any [[changeling]]\nreceives a bonus to attempts to gather information while in\nthe Cracked Mirror.\n\nA shrine dedicated to the [[Keeper]] is hidden in\nthe basement of the Cracked Mirror, and many of\nthe regular customers participate in secret ceremonies to this deity. The [[doppelganger]] Zaz maintains the shrine. While\nZaz gets along well with the [[Tyrants]], her true loyalty\nlies with the [[Cabinet of Faces]], the mysterious cult of\nthe [[Traveler]] hidden in the shadows of [[Khorvaire]].\nShe generally helps the Tyrants, but she often sets\nher own bizarre schemes in motion.\n\nThe owners and staff of the Cracked Mirror appear\nto change on a weekly basisâ€”one week the innkeeper is\na cheerful male [[dwarf]] named Mrogab, the next week\nshe's a surly female [[half-orc]] named Traaka. In fact,\nthe staff consists of two [[doppelganger]]s (not counting\nZaz) and six [[changeling]]s, including [[Loz]]. These eight take turns playing various roles at the inn and performing work for the [[Tyrants]]; they enjoy creating elaborate dramas with these roles, and each trip to the Cracked Mirror should\ninvolve colorful new personalities. While the on-duty\nstaff generally assumes the forms of other races, most\nof the doppelganger or changeling clientele maintain\ntheir natural forms while at the inn. ",
