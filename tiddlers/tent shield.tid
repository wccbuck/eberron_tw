title: tent shield
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When this shield is tossed on the ground and the command word is spoken, the shield grows and morphs into a sturdy three-person tent made of peculiar silver canvas.

Speaking the command word again causes the tent to transform back into a shield, provided that no creatures are inside. Any objects inside the tent when it collapses are ejected and remain outside the tent as it folds.
