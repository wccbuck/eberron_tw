type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When you drink this inky potion, squirming [[black tentacles]] explode from your mouth and fill a 5 foot radius around you. They persist for up to 15 seconds. When a creature enters or spends a few seconds inside the affected area, they must dodge the tentacles or else be struck and restrained by the tentacles until the effect ends or until they fight their way out.
