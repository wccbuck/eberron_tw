The only vegetation consists of blood-red\nmoss and a thick layer of shimmering slime. A jagged\nrock formation might be a piece of an ancient wall, if you\nstretch your imagination.\n\nTens of thousands of years ago, [[fiend]]s ruled [[Khorvaire]]. The Demon Wastes held the seat of power for\nsome of the mightiest [[archfiend|overlord]]s, home to cities of\n[[rakshasa]]s and [[demon]]s. Most of these foul entities perished or fled long ago, but a few still linger in this place\neven as new ones crawl up from the depths of [[Khyber]].\nA handful of primordial ruins sustained by dark magic\ndot the bleak landscape\u2014ruins that may still be home to\nfiends and their treasures.\n\nThe northern coastline of the region is beset with spires of [[demonglass]] which can pierce the hull of a ship in an instant. The [[Shadowcrags]] and [[Icehorn Mountains]] separate the Demon Wastes from the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. A series of canyons known as the [[Labyrinth]] further separate the Demon Wastes from the rest of\n[[Khorvaire]]. Due to ancient warding magic, any creature\nthat wishes to leave must do so through the Labyrinth.\nThese passes are guarded by the [[Ghaash'kala]], tribes of\n[[orc]]s sworn to contain the evils of the Wastes. Beyond\nthe Labyrinth, the mortal inhabitants of the Demon\nWastes include a brutal people known as the [[Carrion Tribes]]. Each tribe is devoted to an [[archfiend|overlord]], and they\nengage in endless battles against the [[Ghaash'kala]] and\nthe other Carrion Tribes.\n\nIf you're creating a character from the Demon Wastes,\nyou're likely associated with either the Ghaash'kala or\none of the Carrion Tribes. \n\n\n!! Interesting Things About {{!!article}}{{!!title}}\n\n* A variety of [[fiend]]s inhabit the Wastes, including [[devil]]s, [[rakshasa]]s, and [[demon]]s. These creatures are spawned by [[Khyber]], not the Outer Planes.\n* The Demon Wastes are riddled with portals to abyssal demiplanes, unearthly realms populated by fiends and other horrors. These inner realms include vast and twisted forests, living oceans, realms of rusted iron, and stranger places. \n\n!! Ghaash'kala Characters\n\nThe [[Ghaash'kala]] are primarily [[orc]]s, but their numbers\ninclude a few [[half-orc]]s and members of other races.\nThey devote their lives to guarding the [[Labyrinth]] and\ncontaining the evils of the Wastes. When creating a\nGhaash'kala character, consider the following: \n\n* ''The Binding Flame.'' The Ghaash'kala worship Kalok Shash, the \"Binding Flame.\" Fundamentally the same religion as the [[Silver Flame]], Kalok Shash is a harsh faith that requires all able-bodied folk to fight in the endless war against the forces of darkness.\n* ''Sacred Champions.'' As a Ghaash'kala, you are a champion of the Binding Flame. A [[paladin]] sworn to the Oath of Vengeance, a barbarian on the Path of the Zealot, and a [[cleric]] of the Light or War domain all represent a logical path for a Ghaash'kala character. Outlander and hermit are appropriate backgrounds, reflecting your harsh upbringing or religious devotion. \n\n!! Carrion Tribes\n\nThe [[Carrion Tribes]] descend from explorers and refugees twisted by the evil in this realm. Explorers usually encounter these savage folk as enemies, but occasionally a hero emerges from the shadows. When creating a character from the Carrion Tribes, consider the following:\n\n* ''Sworn to an Overlord.'' Your tribe is devoted to an [[archfiend|overlord]]. This can serve as the roots of a [[warlock]]'s pact or the inspiration for a barbarian's rage. Are you still loyal to your dark lord, or did you break free from its influence? Either way, work with the GM to develop the details of your overlord.\n* ''Child of a Savage Land.'' You were born into a lawless realm where violence was the only constant. How have you adapted to life on the other side of the [[Labyrinth]]? Are you superstitious, refusing to adapt to this new world, or are you doing your best to learn the ways of this strange realm?\n* ''Why Did You Leave?'' You began your life as a servant of darkness. Have you embraced the light? Are you fighting the servants of your former master? Or are you a pawn in a conflict between [[overlord]]s? You might serve an evil force, but the cultists you fight serve even darker powers. \n\n!! Cities and Sites\n\nSettlements are few and far between in the Demon Wastes. The Carrion Tribes are semi-nomadic, assembling camps in the crumbling ruins of long-forgotten cities built by [[demon]]s in the first days of the world. \n\n!!!
