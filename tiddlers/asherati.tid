Asheratis are [[humanoid]]s who have adapted to sandy desert environments. An asherati can make their smooth rust-red skin glow as if with an inner fire, giving off a piercing illumination that suffuses through sand. The asheratis live in tight-knit family units under the [[Menechtarun Desert]] in [[Xen'drik]], swimming through sand it as if it were water.
