type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This little restaurant is one of the well-kept secrets of [[Sharn]], and without a recommendation, a character only knows about it if they are familiar with this district. The Kavv family emigrated from the city of [[Stormreach]] in [[Xen'drik]], and the food is an intriguing blend of [[Khorvairian|Khorvaire]] styles, using Xen'drik spices and vegetables most people have never encountered. Kavv's is a small, intimate establishment, and despite the extremely high quality of the food, a typical meal is quite inexpensive. Saza and Taji Kavv still have many friends and relatives in Stormreach, and if the party befriends the Kavvs these contacts could prove to be useful during
trips to Xen'drik.
