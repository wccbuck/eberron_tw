title: rogue ooze
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This potion flask contains a shadowy alchemical [[ooze]]. After it is released from the flask, the ooze persists for exactly 1 minute before it dissolves into a puddle of acidic goo. The ooze moves at a speed of about 1 mph in a general direction you specify ("north," or "down this corridor"). Whenever it comes within 10 feet of a trap, it moves to the trap and attempts to disable it with acid.
