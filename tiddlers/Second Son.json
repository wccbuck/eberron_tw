        "text": "The Second Son is an [[archfey]] representing the jealous heir who stands just\nbeyond the claim to a title. He is always scheming to\nusurp power or steal the things that belong to others. In\nmost tales, his gambits ultimately end in failure, further\ndriving his bitterness. His formal title in the [[Moon Court]]\nis the ''Count of the Barren Marches'', as his [[lands|Barren Marches]] are\nalways inferior to those of his siblings.\n\nMuch like the [[Lady in Shadow]], the Second Son is a nebulous figure whose details are less important than his covetous and conniving nature. Exact details aren't important to his story. Every time one visits the [[Barren Marches]], he could be lusting after something new; even within the [[Moon Court]], his older sibling might change from season to season. However, in each version of his story, he always has a widely-beloved elder sibling who has something the Second Son desires. The Second Son never ends up with what he desires for long... and even if he does, he'll soon realize it's not enough. \n\n!! Pacts with the Second Son\n\nThe Second Son is the patron of those who have been passed over, those denied what they think they deserve, those forced to watch while lesser people are elevated because of sheer luck, or being born a few seconds earlier. The Second Son feels your pain and he will give you what you deserve... if you are willing to pay the price and to do what must be done. \n\nPeople who form pacts with the Second Son don't usually advertise it, because the primary benefit the [[archfey]] provides is screwing over the person who //actually// deserves the thing you want. And as long as you maintain your pact, and continue to pay its ever-increasing price, perhaps you'll continue to get away with it. But the stories of the Second Son rarely end well. There's undoubtedly a noble family in [[Aundair]] with a Second Son pact who only has and maintains its status because of the terrible, fatal accidents that have befallen the people who otherwise would hold their position or challenge them in any way. How much longer can they defer the consequences of their sinister bargains?\n",
