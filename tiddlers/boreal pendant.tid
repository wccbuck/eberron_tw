This enlarged, floating snowflake is magically held in place by golden brackets, and changes its shape as temperatures fluctuate. While [[attuned|attunement]] to this pendant, you are resistant to the cold, and give off an aura of cheeriness.

The snowflake has 6 charges, and regains <<dr 1d4+1>> expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the following spells:

* [[charm]] (1 charge)
* [[color spray]] (1 charge)
* [[hypnotic pattern]] (2 charges)
* [[ice storm]] (2 charges)

If you expend the pendant's last charge,  the [[consequence]] of a [[failed roll|bad outcome]] or [[mixed success]] causes the snowflake to melt into a puddle of water. After 1 year, the pendant reforms around the magical golden brackets that held it in place.
