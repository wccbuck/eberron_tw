True or not, the Sel Shadras encouraged the\nrumors and benefited from the reputation. Although\ntheir smuggling operation wasn’t as large as that of\nthe [[Lassites|Lassite family]], the gnomes possessed a great treasure:\na handful of sails with [[air elemental]]s woven into the\ncloth, granting them favorable winds and the ability to\nmatch the speed of [[Lyrandar]] [[galleon|elemental galleon]]s. The family still\nowns these //windsail//s, and many believe that the Sel Shadras\nnever stopped their smuggling—they simply reduced\nthe scale to avoid detection by [[Galifar]].\n\nThe Sel Shadras were never as beloved as the [[Lassites|Lassite family]], but the [[gnome]]s had connections across many\npirate crews and were masters of finance and criminal\nstrategy. According to the [[Stormreach Compact|History of Stormreach]], the\nSel Shadras are responsible for the administration\nof justice; however, it’s an open secret that they also\noversee crime. The original [[Storm Lords]] knew what\nsort of city they were building, and they knew that\nthey needed someone to watch the underworld. A\ntypical thug might never realize that his boss is tithing a percentage of profits to Lady [[Kirris|Kirris Sel Shadra]], “the Spider of [[Stormreach]],” and that’s how she likes it. \n\nThe Sel Shadras monitor crime, and they also\ndetermine punishment. The Sel Shadras are the [[magistrates|Crime in Stormreach]] of the city, capable of administering summary\njudgment on anyone brought in by the [[Stormreach Guard]]. Over the years, Lady [[Kirris|Kirris Sel Shadra]] has formed an\nalliance with the [[Blood Council]] of the [[Red Ring]], and\nviolent criminals are sent to the ring in exchange for\na share of the profits from their fights. Lady Kirris\nhas also established a working relationship with\nHouse [[Thuranni]]. Lady [[Miravella Uruvai d'Thuranni]] has\nher own interests in [[Stormreach]] and largely wants\nto be left alone. Lady Kirris keeps both criminals\nand the [[Stormreach Guard]] out of Lady Miravella’s\nway; if anyone is foolish enough to cause trouble for\nThuranni, the Sel Shadras help hide the bodies. In\nexchange, the Sel Shadras gain access to the special\nservices of House Thuranni.",
