Its\nspiraling corridors contained volumes of poetry,\narcane treatises, and much more—including the\noriginal manuscript of [[Karrn the Conqueror]]’s\nfamed [[Analects of War]]. Atop the spire lies the\n''Vermishard Academy'', where the nobles of [[Galifar]]\nstudied magic; while not as versatile as [[Arcanix]],\nthe Academy was considered the finest place to\nlearn the arts of [[enchantment]]. The current status of the Vermishard of Lore\nis unknown.",
