Farming communities in northern [[Breland]] (and [[Cyre]] before it fell) often have a blessing tree, a large centrally located tree that serves as a shrine to [[Arawai]] and [[Boldrei]]. Locals hang small offerings in the branches of the tree, especially as thanks for a good harvest or the birth of a child.
