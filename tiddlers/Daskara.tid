Daskara was one of the [[Five Nations]] of [[Khorvaire]] before the unification of the continent under the kingdom of [[Galifar]]. It covered much of the area occupied by modern-day [[Thrane]], and was known for its population of devout Vassals of the [[Sovereign Host]]. Its name survives in its ancient capital, the city of [[Daskaran]].
