Monolithic Riedra, also called the “Land of [[Unity]]”
and the “Land of the [[Inspired]],” now stands where
once many human nations squabbled for power.
Riedra is ruled by the [[quori]]—spirits of nightmare who
reached out from [[Dal Quor]], the Region of Dreams, to
dominate [[Sarlona]] through psionic obfuscation and
control. Although Riedra appears to be peaceful and
orderly, this image is a lie perpetrated by the [[quori]],
who possess the [[Inspired]] leaders of Riedra.

Riedra is nominally led by Eidolon [[Surasek]] from the capital city, [[Durat Tal]].

!! History of Riedra

Three thousand years ago there were a [[dozen kingdoms|Sarlonan province]] in
[[Sarlona]]. Today there is only one: the empire of Riedra.
The change began some fifteen hundred years ago, when
the [[quori]] first came to Sarlona. Initially, the quori spirits
could not completely dominate their hosts. Instead, they
could only whisper into susceptible minds, fanning ambitions and aggravating existing feuds. Within two centuries, Sarlona had collapsed into [[chaos and war|Sundering]]. By this point,
the quori had full control over a handful of hosts, enabling
them to produce the first of the [[Inspired]]. These [[psions|psionics]]
and psychic warriors stepped into the political void, using
their mental powers to systematically seize control from
the weakened warlords.

They proclaimed themselves to be souls inspired
by divine forces, sent to guide [[Sarlona]] to a new age of prosperity and glory. All they required was absolute loyalty. It took another two centuries of mental manipulation, military conflict, and pure guile, but when the
battles finally ended, the [[Inspired]] held sway over all
of lowland [[Sarlona]]. They named this empire Riedra.
For the next thousand years, the Inspired consolidated
their power, strengthening their hold on the people
of Riedra. They purged the land of any traditions that
could be a threat to their power—notably any form of
magic, which could provide the people with a counter to
the natural [[psionic|psionics]] powers of the Inspired—and hunting down the [[kalashtar]], who had unwittingly shown the
[[quori]] the path to [[Eberron]]. Some of their enemies took
refuge in the mountains of [[Adar]]; others fled to [[Khorvaire]], settling in the kingdoms of the [[Five Nations]] or
establishing new colonies in the [[Shadow Marches]] or the
[[Demon Wastes]].

For the past thousand years, the borders of Riedra have
been closed to foreigners. Even today, the [[Inspired]] have
no interest in allowing the people of other nations to spoil
their terrestrial paradise. But after centuries of scheming
and planning, the Inspired are finally beginning to turn
their attention to [[Khorvaire]], and Riedran ambassadors
can be found in courts across the continent.

!! Riedra Today

The Inspired hide their secrets well. Those who have
managed to breach the borders of Riedra speak of titanic
monoliths that lie within. The sages of the [[Twelve]] believe
that these monoliths enhance the psionic powers of the
Inspired, drawing on the mental energy of the populace
in order to supply their masters with vitality.

The [[people of Riedra|Riedrans]] follow the [[Path of Inspiration]] and believe that the [[Inspired]] are divine avatars, sent to guide and protect their nation. Most are willing to die for their Inspired lords. Most communities are agricultural villages, designed to be as self-sufficient as possible. Inspired overseers manage the work force. A
vast [[fortress-metropolis|bastion city]] at the center of each web of villages
is home to the bulk of the armed forces of the region and
the high-ranking Inspired nobles.

!! Interesting Things about Riedra

* The members of the sinister network of the [[Dreaming Dark]] serves as the eyes of [[Dal Quor]]. They are spies, saboteurs, and psychic assassins. These agents receive their orders directly from the [[quori]] on Dal Quor and have considerable authority among the [[Inspired]].
* Where the Dreaming Dark works to undermine other civilizations, the members of the [[Thousand Eyes]] protect Riedra itself. They observe the people of Riedra, seeking any sign of internal dissension or outside infiltration. Any time a threat is identified, the Eyes strike without warning or mercy.

!! Everyday Psionics

In [[Khorvaire]], [[arcane magic]] is part of everyday life; [[magewright]]s are found in most villages. In Riedra, both magic and [[psionic|psionics]] power are tightly controlled
and largely confined to the [[Inspired]] and the [[Chosen]].
However, a few psionic effects have an impact on daily
life. For the people of Riedra, such wonders are proof of the miraculous power
of their benevolent overlords. For example, street signs don't bother with names (and many [[Riedrans]] are illiterate anyway); instead, a subtle telepathic signal allows you to always //know// where you are in a Riedran city, if you stop to think about it.

All of these functions draw power from the [[hanbalani alta]]s, the massive monoliths spread across the nation. If a monolith is shut down or destroyed, any community tied
to it loses access to these functions.

These are the most common effects, but the [[Inspired]] can develop new techniques, and you should feel free to invent effects unique to a specific [[bastion|bastion city]] or village. A bastion might have an inner sanctum shielded by an impenetrable wall of ectoplasm; the only way to get past this field is to shut down the local monolith.

!! Provinces, Spheres, and Bastions

The eight [[provinces|Sarlonan province]] of Riedra are divided into territories known as "spheres". A sphere is a circular region centered on a fortress-city called a [[bastion|bastion city]], which is ruled by a particular [[Inspired]] lord. The territory takes its name from its master—the city of [[Durat Tal]] is in the Sphere of [[Surasek]],
in the province of [[Ghirvagura]]. All Inspired hold the title
of Lord or Lady; the ultimate leader of a bastion carries
the title of ''Eidolon''.

The typical bastion is a metropolis, and many of them
rival [[Sharn]] in population. They are centers of industrial
production, supporting the bulk of a sphere's troops.

Surrounding a bastion is a network of villages,
spread out in as orderly a manner as possible, taking
environmental factors and resources into account. A
sphere contains dozens of villages. Most villages focus
on agriculture and simple industry. Although some
variance in styles and customs exists from province to
province, villages within a sphere are virtually identical. No thorps, hamlets, or towns can be found—when a
populations rises to a sufficient level, the Inspired draw
off the excess to create a new village.

Riedran villages are functional and ascetic in
design. The [[community|Riedrans]] is centered around a building
that serves as a dining hall and a public assembly, where
people gather to listen to the sermons of the local priest
or to hear stories of the glorious deeds of the [[Inspired]].
Villagers live in communal dormitories, with separate
houses for children.

While [[Riedra]] has no [[lightning rail]], villages and
spheres are linked by a comprehensive network of maintained roads. The [[Inspired]] also have a secret system of psionic [[teleportation circle]]s at their disposal, passing through the central hub of [[Durat Tal]]. The number of gates is
limited. The [[Inspired]] can teleport cargo directly from
[[Dar Jin]] to Durat Tal, but getting those goods to the village of Keloor requires a caravan.

!! Who Rules Riedra

The rulers of Riedra are the [[quori]]. All important decisions concerning the fate of the nation are made in [[Dal Quor]]. The bastion lords don't gather in Riedra to debate
policy, because such councils are held in Dal Quor. To
a foreigner, it seems that the bastion lords and generals
of the [[Harmonious Shield]] operate unilaterally; however,
they all act in perfect accord with the plans formulated
in the Region of Dreams.

While the destiny of Riedra is set in dreams, a complex
bureaucracy manages its daily affairs. The [[Inspired]] hold
the top tier. A powerful Inspired noble rules each [[bastion city]], and Inspired serve as generals, ambassadors, inquisitors, and high ministers. Although mighty Inspired are
rare, lesser Inspired serve throughout society, in positions
where trust or psionic power are required.

Beholden to the Inspired, the [[Chosen]] dedicate themselves to being worthy of inhabitation by an [[il-altas|Path of Inspiration]]. They manage the bulk of the administration of Riedra, also serving as officers in the military. Chosen overseers govern most villages. The most important positions are granted to
Chosen who served as Inspired before their quori spirits
moved on to other hosts; after decades of possession, the
minds of these individuals have been molded by the quori,
and they are fully trusted by the overlords.

Whether [[Inspired]], [[Chosen]], or commoner, [[Riedrans]]
serve in one of four groups: the [[Unity]], the [[Thousand Eyes]],
the [[Harmonious Shield]], or the [[Dreaming Dark]].

!! Riedra and Khorvaire

The first contact between the [[Five Nations]] of [[Khorvaire]] and Riedra occurred
on the neutral ground of [[Xen'drik]], and much trade has
passed through this gateway. During the [[Last War]], Riedra
provided nonmilitary assistance to many of the warring nations. [[Inspired]] ambassadors came to the courts of the Five Nations, occasionally serving as mediators
between opposing forces. Seen as impartial outsiders,
they're respected for their apparent wisdom and empathy.
During this time, the [[Dreaming Dark]] gained a foothold
in Khorvaire. For the last century its agents have been
spreading across the continent, sowing dissension and
subverting agents for future use.

Today, [[Inspired]] ambassadors can be found in every
major metropolis and many of the lesser large cities of Khorvaire.
Most ports have small Riedran communities. Riedran
goods are becoming more common. On the sordid side of trade, the sale of [[dreamlily]] has become a major industry in the underworld of Khorvaire.

While the Inspired have been providing material
aid to many nations, their strongest foothold in Khorvaire is in [[Q'barra]]. King [[Sebastes|Sebastes ir'Kesslan]] is currently receiving military support from Riedra; the [[Harmonious Shield]] has established garrisons in the region around
[[Newthrone]] to help defend the settlers from [[lizardfolk]]
attacks. In the process, they are working to spread Riedran values. Rumors say that construction has begun on
a [[hanbalan|hanbalani alta]].

Given their extensive presence, the Inspired have
much to offer. If war looms anew, [[Aundair]] could seek
Riedran aid to defend itself from the larger armies of
[[Thrane]] or [[Karrnath]]. A desperate move, certainly, but
perhaps Queen [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]] will be swayed by vivid dreams of
the power such an alliance might bring.

Kings and queens are not the only people who deal
with the [[Inspired]]. Even though Riedran commoners
rarely mingle with foreigners, Inspired ambassadors
and their staff are active in their communities. Exotic
and clever, these beautiful strangers fascinate the upper
crust of [[Khorvaire]]. In [[Sharn]], Ambassador [[Jorasesh]] often
gives impromptu lectures at [[Morgrave University]]. Both
Jorasesh and his aide [[Helkatash]] can be found at all of
the major galas and social events of the city.

Although the Inspired have extended their hand
to Khorvaire, they have been reluctant to let foreigners visit Riedra. It is only recently that any outsider has been granted permission to venture beyond the foreign
quarter of [[Dar Jin]] and [[Dar Ulatesh]].

!! Getting There

The borders of Riedra have been closed for a thousand
years. However, the [[Inspired]] have recently softened
this policy of isolation. The foreign quarters of [[Dar Jin]]
and [[Dar Ulatesh]] were established to serve as centers for
international commerce. A few scholarly expeditions
have been allowed to venture into the heart of the land.
With this precedent, it is possible for outsiders to travel
into Riedra legally, but it's not easy.

In order to explore Riedra, a traveler must acquire
a transit visa from the [[Iron Gate]], the foreign relations
office, in [[Dar Jin]] or [[Dar Ulatesh]]. This scroll provides
a description of the travelers, states the nature of their
business, and delineates any restrictions on travel. A
bearer might be limited to traveling in specific provinces
or spheres, and the visa usually has a set expiration date. The document is notarized with a [[sentira]] seal, a [[psionic|psionics]] sigil that carries the thought-signature of the [[Inspired]]. Every patrol challenges foreigners abroad in Riedra, and every
village overseer asks to see their visas.

The [[Iron Gate]] does not charge for transit visas, but
it rarely grants them. Riedra isn't for tourists. Travelers
must provide a valid reason for entry and show that they
have no criminal tendencies or intent, as well as enough
knowledge to avoid accidentally breaking [[Riedran laws|Laws of Riedra]]. Finally, a [[mind probe|detect thoughts]] is often used to ensure that the travelers have no
hidden motives. If the request is especially intriguing or
risky, the [[Iron Gate]] might allow travel but send a member
of the [[Thousand Eyes]] along as a chaperone and observer.
Unless the party is deemed a serious risk, this observer
is a [[Chosen]]; the controlling spirit only takes possession
of the vessel every few hours to check on the situation.

Travelers who have shady connections and talents can acquire a notarized parchment from the [[Dream Merchants]] for [[20 c|money]]. Once they have the sentira seal, travelers can either forge the visa or pay another 5 c to have one forged by the merchants. In this latter case, someone examining the document must closely examine it to discern the falsity of the visa.

Once out into wider Riedra, foreigners face other
problems. Most of the [[people|Riedrans]] speak only [[Riedran]] and are
illiterate. They possess the skills the [[Inspired]] deem necessary. Military officers, overseers, priests, and members of the [[Iron Gate]] are all literate, and some speak [[Common]] or [[Quor]]. Riedrans avoid all contact with foreigners, and
they are typically unfriendly.

Supplies pose another challenge. No inns exist in Riedra. Every village has a dormitory reserved for Riedran travelers and troops, and a transit visa might specify
that the bearers should be given access to such shelter.
Otherwise, travelers must contend with the unfriendly attitude of a local overseer. Food is provided along with shelter, but travelers can't buy goods, since money is an alien concept to Riedran villagers. The wilderness survival skills are the simplest way to get along in Riedra, allowing travelers
to live off the land.

Travel is safe along the main roads of Riedra. Soldiers
patrol regularly, and most monsters were wiped out long
ago. Danger rises when one strays too far from the roads.
