The worst of these occurred in\nthe city of ''Yaruun'', where every inhabitant was left insane.\nThe [[Inspired]] revealed that these attacks were the work of an\nunexpected enemy: the [[kalashtar]], mortals who had given\ntheir bodies to //altavars// (evil spirits). Now the [[Riedrans]] had\na focus for their anger, and thus was set in motion the long\nstruggle between [[Riedra]] and [[Adar]] that continues to this\nday. After a few costly battles, the Inspired chose to place\nAdar under siege instead of trying to invade and conquer\nit. \n\nThe Madness of Yaruun was the defining moment of the\nrelationship between [[Riedra]] and the [[kalashtar]], and it indel­ibly etched the image of the monstrous kalashtar into the Riedran psyche. Of course, the reason behind the attacks\nremains a mystery. The kalashtar have no records of them.\nIt is possible that the Madness was staged by the [[Dreaming Dark]] to turn the people against the kalashtar. After a thou­sand years, the truth might never be known.",
