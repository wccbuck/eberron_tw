type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Madness fuels Korliac's terrible power. This madness drove him from his home [[plane]] of [[Fernia]] in search of knowledge forbidden even to the [[fiend]]s. Now he serves the [[overlord]] [[Tul Oreshka]], convinced that this archfiend guides him on the path that destiny has set for him, a path that will shatter the universe into madness and gray flame. Korliac is most active in [[Xen'drik]], where he might aid explorers when their quest serves the goals of the [[Lords of Dust]] (or destroy adventurers whose plans pose a threat).
