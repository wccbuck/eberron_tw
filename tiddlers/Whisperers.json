        "text": "This cult represents an ancient tradition found across the [[Shadow Marches]]. Whisperers have a strange bond with [[gibbering mouther]]s, and a Whisperer family will keep a mouther somewhere in their home. When a family member reaches a certain age, they are fed to the mouther; the Whisperers believe that the soul of the departed lives forever in the mouther and can be heard in the gibbering. The name “Whisperer” comes from their tradition of prayer, a sort of ecstatic murmuring that mimics the chaotic gibbering of the mouther.",
