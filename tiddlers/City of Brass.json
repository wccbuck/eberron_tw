The statue reshapes itself to match\nthe appearance of the efreeti who currently dominates society;\nboth the statue and whichever efreeti it depicts are known as\nthe Sultan. Currently, the Sultan is [[Azhalar]] of High Hearth. \n\nAll efreet have mansions in the City of Brass, though at any\ngiven time, many dwell within their island estates. Likewise,\nthere are always a few [[dao]] in residence showing off their latest\ncreations and taking new commissions. The streets are filled\nwith [[mephit]]s and [[salamander]]s. Visiting mortals are a curiosity,\nbut most elementals are too busy to take much time on them.\nThe City of Brass is ringed with [[teleportation circle]]s, linking it\nto all of the estates and major foundries.",
