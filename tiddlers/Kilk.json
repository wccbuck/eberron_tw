On the surface, it appears that Kilk looks out for the mercantile interests of his ward, but he also monitors and manipulates events across the city. Only [[Thurik Davandi]] can match Kilk for intrigues and scheming, and Kilk has a web of informants and spies across the city. He has done his best to make himself useful to the [[King's Citadel]] and the [[Guardians of the Gate]], and as a result he has developed powerful allies within both organizations.\n\nKilk is an invention of the [[Tyrants]]. There is one [[changeling]] who plays the role more often than others, but at any time Kilk could be any one of the Tyrants—even [[Ek]] himself. Through Kilk, the Tyrants have a second way to affect the city, and a more respectable façade for dealing with groups such as the [[King's Citadel]]. ",
