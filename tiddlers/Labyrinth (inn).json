        "text": "Built at the base of an old quarry in [[Bloodstone]], the Labyrinth is a literal hole in the ground. A vast awning keeps rain from flooding the quarry, and customers descend a spiral ramp to get down to the common room. The rooms for rent are scattered throughout a maze of passages, part of a vast network of caves that stretch below the quarry, making it the perfect home away from home for the fugitive who doesnâ€™t want to be found. A family of [[minotaur]]s owns the bar, and they take the privacy of their guests seriously. The price is high given the austere nature of the accommodations, but the Labyrinth caters to fugitives who have gold and need privacy. \n\nA [[medusa]] named Viper manages the bar, and the statues scattered around are a warning to those who might cause trouble. [[Goblin|goblin]]s and [[gnoll]]s surround the central firepit, cheering for the [[harpy]] performing mesmerizing torch songs.",
