type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This gnarled spear is made from a strange flowering form of [[livewood]]. The tip is a viciously sharp thorn, surrounded by a bouquet of leaves and roses.

Each dawn, <<dr 1d4>> rosehips sprout off the spear's delicate greenery; these rosehips can be eaten and have the same effects as a [[goodberry]].
