Adamantine is an extremely hard and durable metal. When properly smelted in specially-designed forges, it can produce armor that is nearly impenetrable, and weapons that can destroy almost any other material.

The [[goblinoid]]s of [[Dhakaan]] were able to create feats of adamantine smelting that even the best [[Cannith]] smiths cannot reproduce today. 

Most adamantine on [[Khorvaire]] is mined from ancient meteor impact sites, but it is rumored that [[Argonnessen]] has naturally-forming adamantine veins.
