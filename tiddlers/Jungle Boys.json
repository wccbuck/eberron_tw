The band is variously estimated to have anywhere from a dozen men to as many as a hundred brigands and a mock court of beggars, harlots, and other hangers-on. A [[half-orc]] outlaw known as [[Tree Viper]] leads the gang. \n\nThe band periodically raids the thorps, villages, and plantations that line the edge of the King's Forest, and sometimes it ambushes caravans and travelers as they move through the forest. The [[Knight Rangers]] have tangled with the Jungle Boys on more than one occasion, but they haven't been able to capture their leader or put an end to their marauding.",
