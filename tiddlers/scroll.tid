Most scrolls are [[spells stored in written form|spell scroll]], while
a few bear unique incantations that produce potent
wards. Whatever its contents, a scroll is a roll of paper,
sometimes attached to wooden rods, and typically kept
safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood.

A scroll is a consumable [[magic item]]. Whatever the
nature of the magic contained in a scroll, unleashing
that magic requires taking a few moments read the scroll.
When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can't be
used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust.

Any creature that can understand a written language
can read the arcane script on a scroll and attempt to
activate it.
