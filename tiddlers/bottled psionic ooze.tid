title: bottled psionic ooze
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This potion flask contains an alchemically altered [[gray ooze]]. After it is released from the flask, the ooze does nothing but consume [[psionic|psionics]] energy from its surroundings. Each creature within 10 feet of it has resistance to psychic damage, and [[advantage]] to resist [[enchantment]] spells and other magical compulsions. After exactly 1 minute, the ooze blinks out of existence.
