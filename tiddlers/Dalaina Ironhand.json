        "text": "[[Middle Tavick's Landing]] is a center for trade and commerce, catering to adventurers, commoners, and merchants bringing cargoes in on the [[Orien]] [[lightning rail]] or by trade\ncaravan. Dalaina Ironhand is a plain-spoken woman who represents the merchants of the ward. She is a hard-nosed negotiator with no sense of humor and no interest in anything beyond the bottom line. She always drives for the best bargain for her people—whatever form that bargain may take—but she has no taste for underhanded intrigue. As a result, she opposes the schemes of the “[[Boromar|Boromar Clan]] Block”—[[Bestan ir'Tonn]], [[Caskar Halavik]], [[Thurik Davandi]], and [[Ilyra Boromar]]—whenever possible. ",
