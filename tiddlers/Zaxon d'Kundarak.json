        "text": "The commander of [[Dreadhold]] is Lord Warden Zaxon d'[[Kundarak]], who has held this post for over a hundred years. Many of his subordinates refer to him as “the Old Rock,” saying he is as cold and hard as the people he transforms into statues. While he rarely lets his emotions slip, he is a good judge of character and little escapes his notice. \n\nThe [[wizard]]s and faculty of [[Arcanix]] consider Zaxon d'Kundarak to be the greatest master of [[abjuration]] in the entirety of the [[Five Nations]]. He is also a [[divination]] expert. The Lord Warden has developed a permanent [[truesight]] effect over the years, and has a permanent [[telepathic bond]] to his two subordinates [[Oralys|Oralys d'Kundarak]] and [[Darunthar|Darunthar d'Kundarak]], the [[Sivis]] [[gnome]] in charge of the [[Dreadhold]] [[stonespeaker|speaking stone]] corps (Lady Tyrin Torralyn d'Sivis), and Baron [[Morrikan d'Kundarak]].",
