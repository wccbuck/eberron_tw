She was one of the greatest [[wizard]]s in Galifarâ€™s army, specializing in [[evocation]] and [[conjuration]]; she negotiated with [[celestial]]s and [[fiend]]s, and bought down her enemies with storm and fire. She was bold and often reckless, but off the battlefield was reportedly kind and gentle by nature.\n\nAundair was born only a minute before her twin, [[Cyre|Cyre Wynarn]].",
