Few outsiders have seen this thriving city of monsters. Of the [[dragonmarked house]]s, only House [[Tharashk]] has a presence in the city. \n\n!! The Shape of the Great Crag\n\nAt the heart of [[Droaam]], a vast mountain dominates an otherwise flat and fertile plain. According to legend, the Great Crag was torn from the earth during\nthe war between the [[Dhakaan]]i and the [[daelkyr]]. Today,\nthe ruins of a goblin city are scattered across the plain,\nand ancient passages honeycomb the mountain.\n\nFor thousands of years, the crag was shunned by\nthe creatures of the region, but the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] have made the mountain their seat of power, crafting a bizarre, sprawling city within the ruins.\nThe blocky stonework of [[ogre]]s stands next to perfectly restored [[Dhakaan]]i architecture. [[Harpies|harpy]] and [[gargoyle]]s roost in the heights, with [[goblin]]s and [[kobold]]s living beneath them in makeshift tents. A good\nnumber of monsters prefer to serve the [[hag]]s rather\nthan their local [[warlord]]s, and the resultant influx of\npopulation has seen the Great Crag become one of\nthe largest cities in [[Khorvaire]]. Population estimates vary widely, but most settle on around 160,000 inhabitants.\n\nDespite its size, the Great Crag is a city of limited sophistication. Many services are difficult to find, and [[Tharashk]] is the only [[dragonmarked house]] that maintains an [[enclave]] in the city. Weapons are easy to come by, since the city’s smiths constantly churn out goods for [[Droaam]]’s mercenaries, and sport can be\nfound in the brutal arena where creatures that defy\nthe hags are sent to die. The city contains temples to\nthe [[Shadow]], the [[Mockery]], and other grim deities, but\nshrines to the [[Sovereign Host]] and the [[Silver Flame]]\nare unknown here.",
