Kyuss is an ancient [[lich]] and champion of [[Katashka]] the Gatekeeper. He resembles a 30-foot tall [[humanoid]] formed from writhing maggots and worms, often draped with a black robe. His titles include the Worm that Walks, the Bonemaster, the Parasite Divine, and the Herald of the Age of Worms.

Kyuss and his followers believe that life is an obscenity, and that death offers only nothingness; thus [[undeath|undead]] is the only worthwhile goal for mortals, a sacred transition that grants mortals their only hope at achieving immortality. Ultimately, Kyuss seeks to serve as the vessel for [[Katashka]]'s release and usher in an "Age of Worms", an era in which all mortals are transformed into [[undead]].

While he was still living, the [[necromancer|necromancy]] Kyuss was a native of [[Sarlona]] who was obsessed with immortality and came to despise the frailties of the flesh. He was driven to [[Khorvaire]] by those who feared his sinister practices. He established his city of Kuluth-Mar in the jungles of [[Q'barra]], and there he continued his research and experiments. Eventually he developed a foul ritual that stripped the life force of his entire city, using it to power his transformation into a [[lich]], using a fragment of [[Katashka]]'s [[dragonshard]] prison as a phylactery. 

It is possible that this transformation did more than make Kyuss a lich; he may have truly merged his essence with that of [[Katashka]], releasing the Grim King from his imprisonment. However, this newborn demigod was imprisoned anew before he could bring his full powers to bear.
