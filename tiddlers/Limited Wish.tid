''Prerequisite:'' [[Genie's Vessel]].

You entreat your [[genie]] patron to grant you a small wish. You can speak your desire to your genie's vessel, requesting the effect of one [[spell]] that is [[rare-tier|spell tier]] or lower and that doesn't normally take more than a few seconds to cast. You don't need to meet the requirements for the spell, including costly components; the spell simply takes effect. Using this feature requires making an [[attempt|Taking Action]]; rolling a [[bad outcome]] still causes the spell to be cast, but in a way that works against you or dramatically spirals out of control. //Be careful what you wish for...//

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again for 3 days, or possibly more if you suffered [[consequence]]s as part of your [[attempt|Taking Action]].
