This magical [[disease]] slowly transforms an infected [[humanoid]] into a [[nothic]]. Initial symptoms include clammy skin, hallucinations, and feelings of isolation and paranoia. As symptoms progress, the infected creature will experience myopia (nearsightedness) and hair loss.

Over time, the infected creature loses all trust in other people, a sentiment fed by delusions that are difficult for the character to distinguish from reality. Common delusions include the belief that that allies are conspiring to steal the victim's riches or otherwise turn against the victim.

The disease and its symptoms last for up to 7 days, though a healthy individual can shake the symptoms in as few as 3 days. If the disease advances to its final stage, the infected creature transforms into a [[nothic]] under the GM's control. Only a [[wish]] spell or divine intervention can undo this transformation.

Because this is a magical disease, a greater [[restoration]] spell or similar magic is required to end the infection on the target, removing all symptoms.
