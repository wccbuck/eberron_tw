title: Sympathetic Theory
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This [[arcane theory]] maintains that an effect produced can be magnified; to create a [[fireball]], burn a ball of flammable guano. In addition, things that have once been in contact maintain a connection—a leaf is still connected to a tree, a lock of hair is still connected to the creature it came from—and magic can flow along this connection. Sympathetic magic still relies on words of power for its verbal components, but its material and somatic components are often quite different from other techniques; rather than tracing sigils in the air, a sympathist [[wizard]] might light a match to produce a [[fire bolt]], or plunge a needle into a wax figure to cast [[crown of madness]].

Sympathetic magic isn’t taught at [[Arcanix]]. It’s generally seen as a primitive form of [[Siberyan|Siberyan Theory]] magic—that the [[wizard]] is channeling the Siberyan energy, but using the sympathetic focus as an alternative to the more complex Siberyan techniques. It is effective, but not as versatile; it relies on the ability to create a sympathetic construct of the desired result. As a result, sympathetic magic is often found used by self-taught “hedge mages” or clans or tribes that have stumbled onto these techniques in isolation. Practitioners may be powerful, but limited in their range of spells or ability to incorporate new ideas.

A second form of sympathetic magic is tied to the "magical thinking" approach to [[artifice|artificer]]. Rather than being a different approach to [[Siberyan|Siberyan Theory]] magic, magical thinking is actually a form of [[Externalist|Externalist Theory]] magic that draws on the power of [[Thelanis]] to temporarily enforce [[fey]] logic on reality. This is more often associated with [[warlock]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[bard]]s than with [[wizard]]s. 

Verbal components in sympathetic magic vary based on the powers being wielded. A fundamentally [[Siberyan|Siberyan Theory]] approach may use [[Draconic]] syllables, even if the caster has just stumbled upon the sounds that produce effective results. Magical thinking could use [[Sylvan]] phrases. On the other hand, sympathetic magic can also involve a chant or a poem describing the desired outcome; essentially, it’s a longer and less efficient process that combining three syllables of power, but it’s something someone can stumble onto even when they don’t know those syllables of power.
