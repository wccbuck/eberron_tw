The namesake of the
[[Torchfire]] district is this crowded, smoke-filled theater near the point where Torchfire, [[Firelight]], and
[[Center Bridge]] converge. Though critically derided
as the bottom of the barrel in [[Sharn]]'s entertainment
scene, crowds fill its hall to bursting every night,
thanks to a winning combination of cheap tickets
and undeniably entertaining shows. It is sometimes
hard to hear the performers over the roaring crowd,
but no one seems to careâ€”except perhaps the performers, or the young playwrights with aspirations
of writing for the [[Grand Stage]].
