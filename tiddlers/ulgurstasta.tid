An ulgurstasta is a horrific [[undead]] maggot-like creature of immense size. Its pale-yellow flesh is covered with distended pores which continually weep a foul-smelling mucus. Twin rows of pulpy legs line its underside, each of which ends in a bony hook. Its head is studded with dozens of beady [[humanoid]] eyes clustered above a vicious fanged maw; in addition, its jaw sits on an eversible pharynx, which allows the ulgurstasta to extend its bite far beyond its body. The thousands of pores on an ulgurstasta's body each contain a coiled black tendril; when the creature is agitated, these tendrils can extend to their full 20-foot range and whip about in a frenzy, slashing at any surrounding creatures and defending the ulgurstasta against projectiles.

The most unique property of the ulgurstasta is its ability to rapidly transform any creatures it consumes into undead [[zombie]]s. Living [[humanoid]]s or [[beast]]s who are consumed by the creature are rapidly killed by the flesh-dissolving necrotic acid in its craw, and then reanimated into skeletal undead under the worm's control. The ulgurstasta can regurgitate these undead servitors whenever it chooses.

The secrets to create an ulgurstasta can be found in an ancient [[Dhakaan]]i manuscript known as the //Volakurar//. The process involves liquefying hundreds of [[humanoid]] corpses in a pit at least 20 feet in diameter, ritually desecrating it, and then sacrificing a dozen intelligent [[undead]] creatures, among other profane rites. The [[Kech Nasaar]] gathered these secrets during the height of the Empire of [[Dhakaan]] through unknown means, but apparently deemed this knowledge too dangerous to be valuable to the empire, and sealed the Volakurar away. 

Despite its monstrous, vermicular appearance, ulgurstastas possess a keen and malefic intelligence. This intelligence grows keener with each humanoid the worm consumes, retaining a fragment of the memories of each victim. An elder ulgurstasta who has consumed many thousands of victims ([[creature tier]] ''4'') may become intelligent enough to master the practice of [[necromancy]] itself.
