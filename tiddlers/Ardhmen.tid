Since the end of the [[Last War]], [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] traders have made their way to the [[Syrk|Syrkarn]] port city of Ardhmen in order to barter for spices
and [[dreamlily]]. This city is the second largest settlement in [[Syrkarn]] (after [[Nderitese]]), but explorers expecting to find themselves landing in the "[[Stormreach]]" of [[Sarlona]] are in for a somewhat muddy letdown. Even after decades of
Lhazaar trade, Ardhmen remains little more than clusters of fishing huts, transitory nomadic trader enclaves, and the ancient stone dock remnants of the port city that
was leveled in the ancient [[magewars|Sundering]].

To learn more about the people of Ardhmen, see [[Syrks]].

Some [[Summit Road]] agents are stationed permanently in [[Ardhmen]] and other Syrk settlements. [[Khorvairians|Khorvaire]] attempting to travel to [[Adar]] make
landfall at Ardhmen, for the coastline of that besieged
mountain land is all but impassable.
