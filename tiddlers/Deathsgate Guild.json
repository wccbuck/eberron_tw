Named for its proximity to the [[City of the Dead]], the district of [[Deathsgate]] prides itself on\nbeing a haven for those who challenge death on a daily\nbasis. The guild's founder, [[Kassh \"Blackaxe\" Droranath|Kassh Droranath]],\ndoesn't care how his members do their jobs, as long as\nthey don't fail. \n\nThe Deathsgate Guild enclave includes a small\nshrine to the [[Mockery]], a god many of the Deathsgaters secretly revere. However, this shrine is carefully hidden, and new members are vetted before\nthey are allowed to find out about the shrine. ",
