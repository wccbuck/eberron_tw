Named for its proximity to the [[City of the Dead]], the district of [[Deathsgate]] prides itself on\nbeing a haven for those who challenge death on a daily\nbasis. The guild's founder, [[Kash \"Blackaxe\" Droranath|Kash Droranath]],\ndoesn't care how his members do their jobs, as long as\nthey don't fail. \n\nThe Deathsgate Guild enclave includes a small\nshrine to the [[Mockery]], a god many of the Deathsgaters secretly revere. However, this shrine is carefully hidden, and new members are vetted before\nthey are allowed to find out about the shrine. Services are led by [[\"Redblade\" Rraac|Redblade's]].",
