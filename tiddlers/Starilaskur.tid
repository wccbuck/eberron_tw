''Population:'' <<ntls>>

Starilaskur is a large city in [[Breland]], located near the shores of [[Lake Brey]] and the [[Brey River]]. The city's population has a higher percentage of devout Vassals of the [[Sovereign Host]] than most other Brelish cities. It is home to the Martial Temple of [[Dol Arrah]], an academy of war that specializes in honing the talents of Vassal [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s. It is also the seat of a large [[Cannith]] [[enclave]], which has led by Viceroy [[Haldon d'Cannith]] for the last sixty years.

In 916 YK, during the peaceful festival of [[Sun's Blessing]], the armies of [[Thrane]] mounted a great assault against Starilaskur. Since that day, many [[Brelish|Breland]] curse Thrane and its dishonorable attack on this holiday.
