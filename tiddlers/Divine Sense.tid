The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. Whenever you open your awareness to detect such forces, you know the location of any [[celestial]], [[fiend]], or [[undead]] within 15 feet of you that is not completely behind a barrier. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its specific name or identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.
