At the head of the bureaucracies of many of [[Daanvi]]'s [[layer]]s are the octons, <<navAndScrollToHeader modron "hierarch modron">>s of the third tier that oversee daily governance. They provide data to other hierarchs, such as productivity reports to [[septon]]s and diagnostic data to [[decaton]]s. Octons have eight mechanical tentacles which they use to manipulate objects and defend themselves, spinning them in a bludgeoning whirlwind.

Like all [[modron]]s, {{!!title}}s have [[truesight]] out to 120 feet and can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to their nature or their instructions. <<navAndScrollToHeader modron "Hierarch modron">>s can also freely fly and hover. Most hierarchs can cast some combination of the following spells: [[clairvoyance]], [[command]], [[detect magic]], [[dimension door]], [[dispel magic]], [[mending]], [[teleport]], and [[wall of force]].
