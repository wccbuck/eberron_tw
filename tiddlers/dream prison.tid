Designed by the [[giant]]s of [[ancient|Age of Giants]] [[Xen'drik]]
during the war with [[Dal Quor]], these statues
were crafted to trap unwary [[quori]] visiting [[Eberron]] in ethereal form.

A dream prison appears as a stone statue of a [[humanoid]] figure with outstretched arms. The arms are linked as if the statue was embracing an invisible form. Small humanoids carved at the statue’s feet indicate that the statue is meant to represent a [[giant]], though it is typically only 5–6 feet tall.

Any ethereal or incorporeal creature with the ability to possess a [[humanoid]] that passes within 30 feet of a dream prison must resist its powerful pull or be drawn into the statue. The creature remains trapped there indefinitely. Only one thing can free a trapped creature from a dream prison: a willing [[humanoid]] can step into the stone statue's embrace and allow the spirit to possess it.
