        "text": "[[Upper Tavick's Landing]] has always\nhad an isolationist attitude, in many ways considering itself to be a separate city within [[Sharn]]. Bestan ir'Tonn has represented this community for the last 30 years. A wealthy barrister from one of the [[Sixty]], he has strong connections to the [[Boromar Clan]]. He is a respected man who has always looked out for the interests of the wealthy of [[Tavick's Landing]], as well as for the Boromars. However, he has a secret: he is an agent of the [[Dreaming Dark]]. Fifteen years ago, the [[Inspired]] dominator [[Tirashana]] infected him with a [[mind seed]], and today he is one of three Inspired moles. While appearing to promote the agendas of his supporters, he has actually been stirring up dissent and discord. ",
