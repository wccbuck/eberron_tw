This huge, unbreakable, black glass monolith looms over a stretch of the floodplain of the [[Hydra River]]. Addis-Ro was said to have experimented with powers drawn directly from the depths of [[Khyber]], and this mysterious ziggurat supposedly marks the passage through which he made his journeys below.\n\nSurrounding the pyramid are statues of humanoids with crocodile-like features and feathered wings in place of arms.\n\n",
