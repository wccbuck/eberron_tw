These allow\nthem to control everyone's dreams over a vast radius. Dreams\nare typically tailored to the region, including local news and\ninstructions. However, if they choose, the Inspired can broadcast\na single dream to all of [[Sarlona]]. Within [[Dal Quor]], this manifests as a distinctive region of the [[Ocean of Dreams]]â€”an array of\nhundreds of thousands of islands, dream-bubbles arranged in\nperfect symmetrical rows, with identical images in each bubble.",
