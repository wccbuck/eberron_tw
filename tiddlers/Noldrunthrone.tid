Noldrunthrone was once the great capital of the [[Mror clan]] of [[Noldrun]] before that clan's sudden disappearance four hundred years ago. It was once a great city to rival [[Krona Peak]], a city glittering with precious minerals pulled from the nearby mine, Korran's Maw.

Today, the surface portion of the city of Noldrunthrone lies abandoned, a clanhold with no clan. But below, the pale [[derro]] descendants of the [[Noldrun]] [[dwarves|dwarf]] dwell in a thriving city. Magnificent buildings rise from the stone and are surrounded by great groves of fungi and fields where all manner of lizards graze. The [[derro]] here are traders who welcome all to their city. But if visitors find themselves still within its walls for the monthly ceremony of Balatham’s Feast—a great sacrifice to some hideous power of the darkness—they must make their escape through an army of ravenous, cannibalistic zealots.
