Uldras are small [[fey]] that dwell in the cold wilderness of [[Icegaunt Island]] and in a few other scattered locations in the [[Frostfell]]. They are about the size of thin [[halfling]]s, but with [[elvish|elf]] features, pale blue skin, and three fingers on each hand. Uldras follow a faith that reveres versions of [[Olladra]] and the [[Keeper]].
