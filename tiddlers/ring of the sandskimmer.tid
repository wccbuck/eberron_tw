title: ring of the sandskimmer
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This ring is made entirely of sand that flows in a circle around your finger. The sand is magically held together by a single, perfectly smooth tiger's eye stone that spins in place as the sand brushes past it. While wearing this ring, you leave no footprints behind when you walk in sand, and you can walk across loose sand as if it were solid, smooth terrain.
