''Sovereigns:'' [[Aureon]], the [[Shadow]]

Magic flows through every [[dragon]]â€™s blood. The [[Sovereign archetype]] of the loredrake devotes their life to harnessing this power and understanding the mysteries of magic. The most accomplished priests of the [[Dragon Gods]] and students of the [[Draconic Prophecy]] are typically loredrakes, and it is the dragons of this path that uncovered the greatest mysteries of [[arcane magic]]. 

Most dragons have great respect for loredrakes, but not all loredrakes are noble creatures. Darkness abides in magic along with light, and a loredrake must decide whether they answer the call of the [[Shadow]], researching avenues of magic forbidden by the [[Conclave]] of [[Argonnessen]].
