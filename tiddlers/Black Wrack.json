        "text": "In a city known for drinking and colorful characters,\nno establishment in [[Stormreach]] has more of the two than the Black Wrack. Proudly declaring itself Stormreach’s biggest\ntavern, the Wrack is nestled against the silver wall on\nthe [[Red Ring]]’s north side. The main room is spacious\nand loud, with a ceiling high enough for the likes of the\n[[minotaur]] [[Kolos]] to walk without stooping.\n\nThe Black Wrack is owned and operated by a no-nonsense but good-natured fellow named [[Handlon the Brick]]. Handlon has one rule: All are welcome to his hospitality, regardless of race or cultural heritage. If a squabble erupts, it gets taken outside immediately, or Handlon puts an end to it, often abruptly and painfully.\nEveryone’s gold is good at the Black Wrack.\n\nToday the tavern’s popularity is at an all-time high, thanks in part to its widely used wall of notices. What began as a way for [[Handlon|Handlon the Brick]] to add some color to his otherwise boring decor has grown into an invaluable resource for adventurers and explorers. It started when he invited his patrons to place job postings, want ads, and other notices on the tavern’s north wall. This proved so popular that Handlon soon formalized the practice, organizing the postings into different classifications. Within a few years, many adventurers who arrived in [[Stormreach]] knew to check the wall for opportunities that might be in the offing. ",
