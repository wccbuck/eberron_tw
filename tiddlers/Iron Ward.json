        "text": "The Iron Ward, a city of gray stone, embodies the worst aspects\nof oppressive law. Councilor Alashta, a cruel [[amnizu]], wields\nabsolute power and can't be questioned or challenged. Most\nof the [[subjects|manifestation]] of the ward are indentured servants, trapped in\ninescapable contracts; visitors must be careful not to accept\nany offers of work in the ward, lest they be similarly trapped.\nThere are regular displays of brutal “justice” in the grand\nplaza. [[Imps|imp]] scurry in the shadows, watching outsiders and\ncarrying news of their actions to the [[chain devil]]s and [[erinyes]]\nthat serve as the brutal police force. While they can't punish\nadventurers “unjustly,” they //can// tempt visitors into misconduct;\nfiendish merchants and patrons have many appealing offers for\nadventurers, but almost all would surely lead to breaking a law\nof the ward, obscure and ridiculous as it may be.\n\nWhile the Iron Ward symbolizes the evils of oppressive order,\nit is driven by order. The police and councilors twist the law and\nweaponize it, but ultimately even they must obey the laws—the\none advantage adventurers have in passing through this place.\nAnd while the subjects of the Iron Ward are brutally oppressed,\nthey're largely symbolic; it's questionable if the subjects even\nexist when no one's around to observe their suffering.",
