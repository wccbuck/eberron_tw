title: preserving pine
tooltip: wood that makes vessels which preserve their contents against contamination and spoilage; used by Seekers to store blood
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Preserving pine is a wood native to northeast [[Khorvaire]] which, when properly treated, can be formed into vessels that preserve their non-living organic contents against contamination, spoilage, or other food-related decay over time. Farmers and grocers frequently use barrels of preserving pine to store foodstuffs, particularly in [[Karrnath]] and the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]; other preservation techniques are more popular elsewhere in Khorvaire.

The practice of creating barrels of preserving pine is a centuries-old tradition of the [[Blood of Vol]] faith, and these barrels are still used today to store blood collected from sacraments. A Seeker-made barrel of preserving pine can be recognized by the runes and prayers etched into the outside of the barrel.
