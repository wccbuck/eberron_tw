A [[shifter]] named Kharva Crack-Tusk tends the [[Nest]] in [[Stormreach]], outpost of the [[Wayfinder Foundation]] on the continent of [[Xen'drik]]. Kharva was one of the first shifters to join the order, and rumor has it the old shifter was present on the very expedition during which Lord [[Boroman ir'Dayne]] contracted his wasting blight. Other rumors whisper of Kharvaâ€™s wild affair with Boroman, cut short by his
debilitating illness.
