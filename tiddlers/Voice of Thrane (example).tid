!! Silver Flame's Crisis of Faith!

The [[Templar|templar]]s of the [[Silver Flame]] are supposed to repre­sent the Church and the nation in pursuit of the highest
ideals of the faith, as they crusade against the forces of
evil across [[Khorvaire]]. But are they fulfilling that high
calling? Or are they just as mired in politics as the [[Brelish|Breland]]
bureaucracy?

High Cardinal [[Baerdren ir'Davik]], who also holds the
rank of grand master of the [[templar]]s, appears to be an
exemplary templar, utterly dedicated to the mission of
the order. Yet it is widely known that he chafes at the
political and bureaucratic responsibilities that his posi­tion on the [[Council of Cardinals]] demands of him. This reporter has learned that Sir Baerdren would readily
surrender his position, were it not for his distrust of his
seneschal, [[Ofejjaia]] of [[Korth]].

Lady Ofejjaia, it seems, has other issues on her per­sonal agenda besides advancing the cause of the knights templar, and one wonders if those issues are tied to her
[[Karrnath]]i origin. Though her wisdom and sound judg­ment are not in dispute, it seems that Sir Baerdren fears that she would drive the order into obsolescence or even
banishment if she were in charge.

Does Lady [[Ofejjaia]] hold her lofty position because of
her loyalty, her piety, and her qualifications? Or is she
there simply so that Sir [[Baerdren|Baerdren ir'Davik]] can keep his eye on
her and ensure that she doesn't sabotage the [[templar]]s
from within?

!! Are You a Six Fanatic?

The Vassals of the [[Sovereign Host]] have long condemned
the [[Dark Six]] as forces of evil. Yet correspondents at the
//Voice of Thrane// have uncovered a shocking phenomenon:
long-standing cults that worship members of the Dark
Six alongside the Sovereign Host.

Most of you know of the [[Restful Watch]], the priests
who tend Vassal cemeteries. What you may not know
is that the priests of the Watch honor both [[Aureon]] and
the [[Keeper]]! They say that the Keeper snatches the souls
of heroes so they can be preserved from [[Dolurrh]] and re­turned when they are needed once more.

Worse still is the [[Three Faces of War]], a cult that wor­ships the Sovereigns of War—including the [[Mockery]], whom they call Dol Azur. Followers of this foul faith say
that the battlefield holds a place for all of these gods, ex­plicitly embracing a deity they acknowledge as the patron
of treachery and terror! This cult apparently began in the
[[Karrnath]]i military but spread across the [[Five Nations]]
during the [[Last War]]. So next time you're talking to a
[[Brelish|Breland]] soldier, remember that they might be a devotee of
the [[Mockery]]!

!! Do They Know the War is Over?

Against all logic and reason, people in [[Breland]] continue
to argue that the [[warforged]]—creations of House
[[Cannith]], lest we forget—are living people with souls,
deserving of the same rights as the rest of us. And yet,
while philosophical debates rage and street protests
grow heated, [[warforged]] who inhabit the dead land
of [[Cyre]] continue to fight as if the war had not ended,
launching raids out of the "[[dead-gray mists]]" to the neigh­boring lands—including, of course, [[Thrane]]. Proclaiming
allegiance to something called the "[[Lord of Blades]],"
these warforged don't seem to recognize the people
of Thrane as living people with souls, so it's hard to
appreciate why we should treat them that way.
