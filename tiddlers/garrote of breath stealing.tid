title: garrote of breath stealing
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This garrote of heavy silver wire has runes of [[elemental binding]] along the handles. An air [[elemental]] is bound to the wire; when the garrote is used to choke an enemy, the elemental sucks the air from the lungs of the victim, causing them to suffocate much more quickly.
