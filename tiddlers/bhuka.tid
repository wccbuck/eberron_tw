The bhukas are a unique [[Xen'drik]] offshoot of the [[goblinoid]] people, and claim to be descended from the first inhabitants of the world. They dwell in canyons and cliffsides of the [[Menechtarun Desert]], particularly where the desert abuts the [[Fangs of Argarak]]. Bhukas are consummate survivors, having a talent for finding water and many physical adaptations that allow them to thrive in the harsh Menechtarun biome. Most notably, bhukas have a frill of skin and bony spines on their neck that they can raise or lower to maintain body temperature; they also use their large veiny ears, which fold flat against their heads, for this purpose. Their long eyelashes keep out sand and dust, and their wide, splayed feet allow them to move easily over the dunes.  A typical bhuka stands between 4 and 5 feet tall and rarely weighs 90 to 120 pounds.
