You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within 60 feet. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must resist your enchantment or else suffer some [[psychic damage|damage type]] and have [[disadvantage]] on its next action in the next few seconds.
