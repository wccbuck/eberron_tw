Tlalusks are massive and aggressive creatures found almost exclusively on the aptly-named [[Tlalusk Island]]. A tlalusk looks something like a muscular horse the size of an elephant, except the creature has six legs and is covered with white fur. The beastâ€™s wide head sports a pair of huge horns and razor-sharp tusks.

Although the tlalusk is an herbivore that feeds on roots and
other tubers it digs out of the frozen ground with its tusks,
it is notoriously ill-tempered, and most carnivores give the
beast a wide berth.
