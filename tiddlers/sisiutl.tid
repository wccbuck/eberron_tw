This strange aquatic creature is an enormous, two-headed serpent. A fierce
humanlike face with terrible, staring eyes glares from where the
serpent heads join its body. It is
about 20 feet long and as
thick and heavy as a giant
constrictor snake.

Sisiutl are very perceptive
and intelligent, despite their
bestial appearance. Those
whom they favor might earn the
creaturesâ€™ protection, but those who
trespass willfully incur their wrath.
