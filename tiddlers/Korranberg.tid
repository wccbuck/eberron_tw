The ancestral home and [[headquarters|Labyrinth (enclave)]] of House [[Sivis]] and the oldest city in [[Zilargo]], Korranberg has long been a seat of learning and a haven for folk who love the written word. Countless aristocrats of other nations come to study in the famous [[Library of Korranberg]]. The offices of the [[Korranberg Chronicle]] are located in the Bookbinder’s Quarter, along with a diverse range of scribes, printers, and the finest cartographers in [[Khorvaire]]. Old scrolls, maps, and weathered tomes can be bought
and sold in the quarter’s Paper Market, and explorers and adventurers make up a sizable portion of the clientele here. The [[Street of a Hundred Temples]] showcases almost every pantheon on Eberron, and includes the Codex Vault, [[Khorvaire]]'s largest
shrine to [[Aureon]].
