Congregants call the temple Rosewood,\nafter the crimson ivy that covers it, and are led by the priest\n[[Berrinessa]], a quiet herbalist. The temple occupies an old ruin, its rituals performed\namid broken pillars and statues of the past. Despite\n[[Stormreach]]’s laissez-faire approach toward religions,\nthe presence of the Blood of Vol does cause uneasiness in\nother districts, where biases against the faith have carried over from [[Khorvaire]]. Remaining within Grindstone gives the temple a measure of protection from its enemies. ",
