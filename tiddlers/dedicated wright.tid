A dedicated wright is a [[homunculus]] created to carry out
the process of item creation on behalf of its master. Unlike
most homunculi, a dedicated wright does not go out on
missions or accompany its master on adventures. Instead,
it stays home working while its master is away.

A dedicated wright is molded from clay, glazed with a
mixture of arcane unguents and the creatorâ€™s blood, and
fired in a kiln.
