        "text": "Chronepsis, the Unblinking Eye, is the [[Dragon God|Dragon Gods]] of Fate, Death, and Final Judgment. He is silent, unconcerned, and dispassionate. Chronepsis judges the souls of [[dragon]]s after death; it is believed that Chronepsis decides if a\ndragon soul will fall into [[Dolurrh]] or ascend along the\n[[Sovereign|Sovereign Host]] paths as laid out in the [[Thir]] faith. \n\nHowever, Chronepsis has another role that is even more important. He is the Lord of Fate\nand Prophecy. The [[Draconic Prophecy]] is the will of the [[Progenitors|Progenitor Dragons]], but many dragons believe that Chronepsis chooses how it will be revealed. An ongoing philosophical debate centers on the question of whether Chronepsis expects [[dragon]]s to follow the path fate lays before them—the traditional view—or whether the Prophecy exists to help mortals choose their own destinies.\n\nChronepsis, like [[Tamara]], looks harshly on any magic that allows a dragon to escape his judgment, from [[raise dead]] to the [[undead]] existence of the [[dracolich]]. Dragon priests usually cast an [[augury]] before raising the dead; this action informs the caster whether the god of fate approves of this action. No automatic consequences for raising a\ncreature against the will of Chronepsis exist; after all, the deity might not actually exist. However, a GM could choose to inflict misfortune on a dragon raised against the will of destiny. Certainly, the [[Eyes of Chronepsis]] would seek to slay the transgressor and return him to his judgment.",
