{"created": "20210201222708294", "title": "Labyrinth", "text": "A massive scar mars the otherwise flat plains that stretch beyond the [[Shadowcrags]] and [[Icehorn Mountains]]. Like wounds gouged out of the earth by gigantic talons, the twists and turns of the canyons and depressions form a torn and ruined expanse of terrain giving way to the plains and windswept deserts of\nthe [[Wastes|Demon Wastes]]. This is the Labyrinth, where the [[Dragon Below|Khyber]] meets the [[Dragon Between|Eberron]] in a land\nof ruin and desolation.\n\nThis vast network of canyons and mesas forms a natural maze of stone. The wind in the canyons sounds like the keening of hundreds of ancient banshees, and sometimes\nthe air inexplicably fills with the smell of fresh blood or\nthe bitter tang of sulfur. The terrain here is most sinister, and it is\neasy to become lost along its unmarked paths, or to\nfall victim to the natural hazards spread throughout.\nBoiling pools of mud, geysers, flash floods, lava flows, and\ncrumbling walls, and crevices sometimes open that drop\ninto the very heart of [[Khyber]] itself frequently claim the lives of reckless travelers. Roving bands of [[demon]]s and savage [[humanoid]]s hunt here in search of flesh and plunder.\n\nThe [[Ghaash'kala]] clans patrol the Labyrinth, keeping the horrors of the Wastes from pushing into the mountains. They discourage travelers from venturing\ninto the [[Demon Wastes]], often to the point of threatening violence. Though they stop short of attacking\nexplorers set on entering, the Ghaash\u2019kala ensure that\nnothing they encounter leaves the Wastes\u2014including\nadventurers who ignore their initial warnings. They maintain a number of small settlements that resemble fortresses\nbuilt into and around secure caves in the canyon walls.\nThe largest, most permanent of these are [[Ghaash Dar]] in\nthe northern canyons and [[Maruk Dar]] in the south.", "modified": "20210727192017937", "tags": "[[Demon Wastes]] desert Khorvaire", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "article": "the ", "category": "location", "color": "#3B5C0A", "polygons": "47.317,-36.56 47.575,-36.48 47.769,-36.35 48.065,-36.37 48.212,-36.67 48.351,-37.07 48.415,-37.52 48.683,-37.58 48.914,-37.82 49.108,-38.1 49.375,-38.34 49.542,-38.2 49.551,-37.87 49.569,-37.47 49.634,-37.16 49.8,-36.94 49.92,-36.71 49.874,-36.53 49.763,-36.44 49.754,-36.18 49.938,-35.9 49.966,-35.63 50.086,-35.6 50.234,-35.72 50.409,-35.9 50.585,-36.24 50.714,-36.54 50.889,-36.63 51.111,-36.64 51.166,-36.98 51.222,-37.29 51.397,-37.29 51.48,-36.99 51.6,-36.48 51.665,-36.1 51.591,-35.85 51.415,-35.56 51.249,-35.57 51.018,-35.47 50.843,-35.19 50.834,-35.04 50.862,-34.9 50.954,-34.64 51.083,-34.54 51.157,-34.62 51.175,-34.75 51.166,-35.0 51.212,-35.19 51.332,-35.22 51.535,-35.04 51.609,-34.75 51.6,-34.5 51.535,-34.2 51.646,-34.04 51.748,-33.95 51.858,-33.96 52.015,-33.89 52.135,-34.05 52.246,-34.07 52.329,-33.88 52.348,-33.69 52.338,-33.47 52.412,-33.38 52.542,-33.2 52.717,-33.11 52.92,-33.28 53.049,-33.26 53.142,-33.03 53.178,-32.8 53.123,-32.54 53.012,-32.3 52.92,-32.0 52.883,-31.8 52.763,-31.64 52.735,-31.33 52.791,-31.04 52.92,-30.74 53.003,-30.5 53.04,-30.19 53.095,-29.77 53.132,-29.49 53.234,-29.26 53.382,-29.14 53.529,-28.95 53.705,-28.71 53.834,-28.62 54.046,-28.75 54.212,-29.02 54.295,-29.32 54.443,-29.61 54.582,-29.67 54.794,-29.59 54.997,-29.63 55.062,-29.45 55.034,-29.07 54.96,-28.74 54.895,-28.38 54.914,-28.08 54.942,-27.69 54.978,-27.27 55.034,-26.85 55.126,-26.57 55.145,-26.2 55.135,-25.69 55.163,-25.23 55.062,-24.79 54.923,-24.58 54.748,-24.57 54.572,-24.57 54.378,-24.68 54.222,-24.62 54.092,-24.63 53.972,-24.78 53.788,-25.06 53.649,-25.25 53.492,-25.35 53.317,-25.35 53.215,-25.42 53.04,-25.56 52.957,-25.76 52.846,-25.95 52.698,-26.04 52.606,-26.1 52.532,-26.38 52.338,-26.59 52.135,-26.63 51.997,-26.75 51.886,-26.9 51.674,-27.03 51.462,-27.07 51.249,-27.05 51.157,-27.32 51.037,-27.56 50.806,-28.29 50.566,-28.48 50.409,-28.91 50.271,-29.23 50.086,-29.49 49.994,-29.7 49.966,-30.04 49.902,-30.33 49.745,-30.52 49.606,-30.76 49.431,-30.82 49.255,-30.97 49.126,-31.08 48.794,-31.2 48.628,-31.47 48.729,-31.91 48.702,-32.13 48.6,-32.52 48.498,-32.72 48.314,-32.88 48.138,-32.98 48.009,-33.07 47.898,-33.36 47.778,-33.67 47.612,-33.82 47.418,-33.87 47.326,-34.01 47.262,-34.28 47.298,-34.56 47.455,-34.8 47.585,-34.96 47.668,-35.12 47.649,-35.29 47.575,-35.4 47.492,-35.55 47.428,-35.72 47.326,-36.01 47.234,-36.21 47.188,-36.47", "style": "{\"color\":\"#C57200\",\"fillColor\":\"#eedb74\",\"fillOpacity\":\"0.5\"}"}
