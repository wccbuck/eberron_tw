        "text": "A stretch of land east of the town of [[Ghalt]], the Crying Fields saw battle after bloody battle in 955 YK as [[Thrane]] and [[Aundair]] fought for control of what is now southern Aundair. During these battles, King [[Aarott|Aarott ir'Wynarn]] deployed experimental eldritch siege engines, terrible arcane weapons whose long-term consequences were not understood. Today, no one farms these fields, no animals graze upon the crimson-tinged grass. The place has a forlorn, melancholy atmosphere, as though a thick and cloying fog hangs over it. On nights when the primary [[moon]] of the month rises full, the sounds of battle can be heard rolling across the empty expanse, and some claim that the dead soldiers even appear to continue their endless struggle for the land.\n\nThe name of the area comes from the sound the wind\nmakes when it blows from [[Lake Galifar]] and crosses into\nThrane. Thatâ€™s when sounds of anguish and despair claim\nthe fields. Low and distant during the day, the cries grow\nlouder and more distinct at night.",
