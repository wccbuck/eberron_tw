Today, no one farms these fields, no\nanimals graze upon the crimson-tinged grass. The place\nhas a forlorn, melancholy atmosphere, as though a thick\nand cloying fog hangs over it. On nights when the primary\nmoon of the month rises full, the sounds of battle can be\nheard rolling across the empty expanse, and some claim\nthat the dead soldiers even appear to continue their endless\nstruggle for the land.\n\nThe name of the area comes from the sound the wind\nmakes when it blows from [[Lake Galifar]] and crosses into\nThrane. That\u2019s when sounds of anguish and despair claim\nthe fields. Low and distant during the day, the cries grow\nlouder and more distinct at night.", "modified": "20210727192002709", "tags": "geography Aundair Khorvaire", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "article": "the ", "category": "location", "color": "#3B5C0A", "points": "42.711,-10", "style": "{\"color\": \"#40262D\"}"}
