        "text": "The Hissing Chorus is a phenomenon observed among the reptilian peoples of the [[Poison Dusk]] of [[Q'barra]]. It is an eerie ululating pattern of hisses, similar to the sound of wind, supplemented by body percussion, such as the tapping or scraping of claws against scales. This musical custom is arrhythmic and unnerving to the ears of outsiders, yet all participants perform the chorus in perfect unison. It is an ecstatic experience driven by instinct which draws the participants into communion with the [[Cold Sun|Masvirik]].\n\nThe Hissing Chorus can be encountered in many ways and with varying intensity. A single [[Poison Dusk]] [[kobold]] might hiss quietly to themself, \"whistling\" while they work. A troop might hiss while they march, with greater volume and complexity. And a mass of [[Poison Dusk]] might all hiss together, guided by a [[dusk-shard|dusk shard]]-imbued champion (such as a [[blackscale]]) whose voice is amplified by magic, with percussionists augmenting the performance, creating a chorus that sends a chill through anyone in earshot.\n\nThe [[Poison Dusk]] is not a culture in the traditional sense, with customs passed on through many generations; they are a disparate group of peoples shaped and united by the fiendish influence of [[Masvirik]], and their customs reflect that fact. As a result, the Hissing Chorus is more akin to speaking in tongues than it is the performance of a symphony.",
