In this chestnut trinket, you can store a solid object that weighs a maximum of 100 pounds. When you press both halves of the chestnut on an object of fitting weight, the object is sucked inside, and the chestnut's pieces join together. During the process of transformation, the item is not damaged in any way. Only the person who stored the item can retrieve it by opening the chestnut.
