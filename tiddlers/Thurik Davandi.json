He gained his seat on the [[Sharn Council]] through a clever combination of flattery and blackmail, and he has a hold over many of the more powerful merchants of [[Menthis|Menthis Plateau]]. He has strong ties with the [[Boromar Clan]] and the [[Zilargo Embassy|Zilargo Embassy (Sharn)]], and often\nuses his influence to help these allies. But he is\nalways looking for ways to increase his own power at\nthe expense of his associates, and he may lure adventurers into his web of conspiracy and deception. ",
