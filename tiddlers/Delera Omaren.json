        "text": "At the end of the eighth century YK, Delera [[Omaren|Omaren family]]\nwas the pirate queen of the [[Thunder Sea]]. Although\nher buccaneers were not as brutal as the [[Amanatus|Amanatu family]],\nshe was bold and clever (she famously felled the [[dragon]] [[Xakolondar|Xarkon the Stormheart]]), and she had amassed a following and a fortune by the time [[Galifar]] sought an end to piracy. When the [[Stormreach Compact|History of Stormreach]] was\ndrawn up, no one questioned Deleraâ€™s right to sit on\nthe council.\n\nAs it turned out, Delera was better suited to the life\nof a pirate than that of an administrator. She invested\nmuch of her fortune in the [[Stormreach Forge]] and the\n[[Foundry]], and her family was tasked with maintaining\nthe infrastructure of the city and outfitting the [[Stormreach Guard]]. Lacking political savvy, Delera agreed to provide these services at too low a cost, and over the years, this generosity caused the Omaren fortune to fade as the other [[Storm Lords]] profited.\n",
