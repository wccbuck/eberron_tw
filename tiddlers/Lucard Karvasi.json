        "text": "Dr. Lucard Karvasi is the administrator, chief physician, and founder of the [[Karvasi Asylum for the Criminally Insane]] in [[Black Arch]], [[Sharn]]. Lucard is tall and imposing, but rail-thin. He is a quiet man whose face barely moves when he speaks; he almost never blinks. Karvasi's sister is married to King [[Boranel ir'Wynarn]]'s cousin, and Karvasi has milked his family's favor in court to run his asylum with little to no oversight. His strong ties to the monarchy also allow him to have criminals sentenced to death or life in prison commuted on psychological grounds and sent to his asylum for \"study and rehabilitation\" instead. \n\nKarvasi's idea of \"study and rehabilitation\" makes what most of his charges did to their victims seem humane. He engages in all manner of horrific abuse, worship of the [[Mockery]], and bizarre experiments on the inmates.",
