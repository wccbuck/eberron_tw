        "text": "The first travelers will see of [[Valenar]] is a pillar of stone rising up from the barren flatlands, a spire that seems unnatural in its height and perfection. It should seem unnatural; it is a //taer//, one of the fortresses of the [[Valaes Tairn]]. Stories say that these monoliths were raised from the earth during the [[Age of Monsters]], shaped by the hands of the legendary [[druid]] Maezan Shal, also known as the Thunderhand. Six of these stone keeps ring the [[Blade Desert]]—[[Stonefeather Spire]], [[Taer Valior]], [[Griffonclaw]], [[Zephyr Keep]], [[Taer Shantara]], and the [[Aerie]]—along with the broken spires of [[Taer Zanathar]] and [[Taer Elladorn]].\n\n[[Lyrandar]] [[airship]]s and [[griffon]]-riding [[Valaes Tairn]] (an organization of aerial combat specialists known as ''Kel Gryfaen'') are often seen coming and going from these fortresses. Each taer is also the home base of a full warclan of ground troops. Only a small complement of soldiers walk the walls of the keep; the [[elves|elf]] prefer to remain in motion, and most of the warbands are in the field, patrolling the lands around their fortress.\n\nThe only people who can find shelter at a [[Valenar]] fortress are the [[Tairnadal]] themselves and their [[Lyrandar]] allies. If you travel with a Lyrandar heir or a Valenar warrior, you might be allowed to rest and refresh yourself, but don't plan on staying long.",
