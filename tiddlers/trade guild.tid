The great [[dragonmarked house]]s are the barons of industry and commerce
throughout [[Khorvaire]] and beyond. These dynastic
houses of commerce derive their power partly from their [[dragonmark]]s, but each house has economic as well as magical dominance in its area of influence. House [[Cannith]]â€™s [[Mark of Making]] makes its dragonmarked heirs the best [[artificer]]s and artisans in
[[Khorvaire]]. But House Cannith also operates crafting guilds whose unmarked [[magewright]]s and crafters benefit from the best training possible.
