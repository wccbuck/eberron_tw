They torture civilians, have\nno concern for collateral damage or their own losses, and make\nlittle effort to hold territory. Their focus is purely on inflicting\nmaximum damage on foes and their own region alike. The\nCentury of the Salted Earth devastates the regions they fight in,\nwhile the Century of Terror creates hideous displays with the\ncorpses of their victims and delights in psychological warfare.\nThe Legion of Cruelty slaughters [[devil]]s and [[angel]]s with equal\nglee, and is despised by [[Justice]] and [[Tyranny]] alike.\n\nAll manner of demons can be found in the Legion of Cruelty;\ntheir form reflects their military role, and many wear battered\narmor, steel scales, or are simply coated in fresh blood. [[Rutterkin|rutterkin]] serve as common foot soldiers. [[Barlgura|barlgura]]s and [[hezrou]]s are brutal shock troops. [[Chasme|chasme]]s and [[vrock]]s flood the skies, while [[goristro]]s are living siege weapons.\n[[Marilith|marilith]]s and [[balor]]s command centuries, while cohorts may\nbe led by even greater demonic beings.\n\nMany within the Century of Terror wear the flayed skins of their foes and\nassert that the [[Mockery]] is part of Cruelty Command.",
