A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within 200 feet. Each creature in the cylinder must dodge or be pummeled by the hailstones. The hail covers the ground in slick ice.

This spell can be upgraded to legendary-tier for an even more destructive effect.
