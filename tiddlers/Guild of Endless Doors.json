        "text": "Based in the city of [[Passage]] in [[Aundair]], this [[arcane order]] of [[conjurers|conjuration]] catalogs [[manifest zone]]s that can serve as [[planar|plane]] portals, along with the circumstances that can open them. They are determined to unlock the secrets of teleportation, and to make this a part of everyday life. They have often feuded with the [[Guild of Moonlight and Whispers]], and some believe that House [[Orien]] has sabotaged their research. It’s worth noting that the Guild of Endless Doors did develop the forms of [[teleport]], [[teleportation circle]], and [[misty step]] currently taught at [[Arcanix]]; it’s simply that those first two spells are largely useless because of how few people in the [[Five Nations]] can actually cast them, and they are working on developing more accessible forms of this magic. However, they are a lesser order and lack the resources of [[Orien]]. That being said, there may well be [[Aurum]] Concordians seeking to undermine [[dragonmarked house]] monopolies who might fund the work of the Guild of Endless Doors.",
