They are determined to unlock the secrets of teleportation, and to make this a part of everyday life. They also study the [[Ethereal Veil]] and ways to transition between it and the Material Plane. \n\nThe Endless Doors have often feuded with the [[Guild of Moonlight and Whispers]], and some believe that House [[Orien]] has sabotaged their research. It’s worth noting that the Guild of Endless Doors did develop the forms of [[teleport]], [[teleportation circle|teleportation circle (spell)]], and [[misty step]] currently taught at [[Arcanix]]; it’s simply that those first two spells are largely useless because of how few people in the [[Five Nations]] can actually cast them, and they are working on developing more accessible forms of this magic. However, they are a lesser order and lack the resources of [[Orien]]. That being said, there may well be [[Aurum]] Concordians seeking to undermine [[dragonmarked house]] monopolies who might fund the work of the Guild of Endless Doors.",
