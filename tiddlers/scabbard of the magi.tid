title: scabbard of the magi
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This scabbard magically forms to fit any blade, as small as a dagger or as large as a greatsword. A blade placed into this scabbard is cleaned of any grime, blood, or rust, and gains the "magical" property (for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to "nonmagical" attacks). This effect lasts until another blade is placed in the scabbard.
