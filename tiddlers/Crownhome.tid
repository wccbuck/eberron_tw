The high walls of Crownhome, the hereditary home of [[Karrnath]]’s royal
family and the dwelling of King [[Kaius ir'Wynarn III]], rise atop King’s Hill in the Highcourt Ward of [[Korth]]. The structure is more a military base than a palace. With over a thousand soldiers stationed here and backed by siege engines and other defenses,
Crownhome embodies the nation’s preoccupation
with battle.

[[Kaius|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]]’s audience chamber is rather austere, but it’s
designed to put visitors off their guard. Elite guards
escort visitors through a labyrinth of twisting corridors.
When they climb a ﬁnal set of stairs into the throne
room, they ﬁnd they’ve emerged from underneath
Kaius’s iron throne (a gift from the [[Mror|Mror Holds]] [[dwarves|dwarf]]) and
now stand with him above and behind them. Maps of
[[Khorvaire]] cover every wall, and a [[Conqueror]] board sits at Kaius’s right hand. The throne
room is strictly for ofﬁcial audiences; Kaius takes no
entertainment there, and his ceremonial duties are few.
Queen [[Etrigani]] rarely uses this chamber; she has a pleasant,
tapestry-ﬁlled audience chamber of her own.
