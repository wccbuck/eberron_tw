title: storm sickle
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This sickle sparks with electricity as beads of water form and drip from its blade. Creatures struck by this blade suffer additional lightning damage. The weapon can make long-range attacks by slashing through the air to send out blades of storming wind; these attacks have a range of 20 feet, or as far as 60 feet with [[disadvantage]].
