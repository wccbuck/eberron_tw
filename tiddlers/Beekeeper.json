        "text": "The Beekeeper of [[Sylbaran]] is an enigmatic figure who wears a veiled, hooded robe and is often literally covered in bees; as a result, few people are even sure of her precise species. The Beekeeper is an influential emissary of the [[Children of Winter]], and she teaches the Children of Sylbaran in her vast apiary to the north of the city. The Beekeeper has an astonishing gift for working with insects, and it is her talents that jump-started Sylbaran’s honey industry and provide the [[Wardens of the Wood]] with their unusual assistants (swarms of bees who can target wrongdoers). \n\nDespite the sinister reputation of the [[Children of Winter]], the Beekeeper is a positive force who works for the general good. She is determined to ensure that the people of [[Sylbaran]] don’t defy the natural cycle of life, which has resulted in House [[Jorasco]] being banned from the town and limits placed on other healers. She wants the people of Sylbaran to be strong and thrive, but they must come by this naturally.",
