Though Isan is no longer in\nany physical condition to travel the rest of the world, his\nshop brings the world to him.\n\nVisitors to this popular novelty shop are greeted with the sights of [[Xen'drik]]. Exotic plants in pots and replicas of artifacts can be found throughout the shop. In addition to novelties and [[trinket]]s, Isan also sells a wide variety of [[magic item]]s. His three daughters help him run the shop.",
