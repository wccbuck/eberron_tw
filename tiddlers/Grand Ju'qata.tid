Grand Ju'qata was a [[titan]] city in [[Xen'drik]] during the [[Age of Giants]], and was part of the [[Group of Eleven]] alliance. Its influence covered a large region known as the Suzerainty of Ju'qata, which included many smaller cities such as [[Bazek Mohl]]. Ju'qata was located in central Xen'drik somewhere between the [[Tempest's Spine]], [[Dread Lake]], and the [[Ash Cauldrons]], but the exact location of the city's ruins are unknown.

Once part of the [[Sulat League]], the Suzerainty of Ju'qata declared itself independent after the sealing of the Fire Prince [[Adaxus]]. While the Sulat [[titan]]s advanced their magical prowess through [[arcane science|arcane magic]], Ju'qata did so with passion and faith; supported by the [[angel]]s of [[Fernia]], they wielded [[divine magic]] rooted in dozens of beliefs and religions. Their intense fervor drew the attention of the [[efreet|efreeti]], who enjoyed hobnobbing and exchanging gifts with the mighty titans. To the Ju'qatans, fire was the essence of love, art, strength, and life itself.

The leader of Grand Ju'qata was the Sultana [[Ju'qat Reskan Taq]], who ruled from her seat at the Alcazar of Ashes. This impossibly immense palace was a vast complex of burnished bronze and dark marble, built at a scale meant to be awe-inspiring even for [[titan]]s. Some of the outer wings of the palace were said to extend into [[Fernia]] itself, merging with the halls of different [[efreet|efreeti]] pashas, ensuring that they were always welcome in the Sultana's legendary parties.

Among the armies of the Suzerainty of Ju'qata were the great [[barbarian]] and [[bard]] soldiers of Zorhan, and the Wildfire [[Druid|druid]]s of Kwinzek Var.
