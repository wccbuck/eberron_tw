type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The northern steppes of [[Aerenal]] are the domain of
the [[Tairnadal]] (primarily the [[Silaes Tairn]]), the warrior elves who seized control of
[[Valenar]]. Although much of their population now resides
in Valenar, many Tairnadal noncombatants—children,
artisans, and the [[druid]]s who raise their remarkable
[[beasts|Valenar beast]]—remain in Aerenal.
