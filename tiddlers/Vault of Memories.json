        "text": "The heart of [[Dolurrh]] is the Vault of Memories. This tower,\ncarved up through gray stone, is larger than any of the great\ntowers of [[Sharn]]. The lowest levels hold the Vault's library;\nhere, the spirit known as the [[Librarian]] interviews each\n[[shade]] and makes a record of its life. His power is such that\nan entire life can be confined to a single large page. Every\nsigil inscribed holds a crucial memory, and if a creature is\nproficient in arcana, they can read the symbol to experience\nthat memory. The many floors of the library hold countless\nbooks of preserved lives, carefully tended by [[shadar-kai]]\nscribes. The Librarian himself is a massive hooded figureâ€”his books are likewise enormous. It's said that he can be many places at once, allowing him to speak to every shade, capturing the story of its life, before it fades.\n\nIn the halls above the library, the [[Queen of the Dead]] keeps\nher many treasures. What seem to be obsidian statues are\nactually [[shade]]s, crystallized to prevent them from being\nentrapped and lost in Dolurrh. Paintings and crystals contain\nmemories that the Queen has chosen to isolate. Beyond these\nare countless trinkets and oddities, items collected by her\nshadar-kai over the vast scope of history. And higher still are\nthe chambers of the Queen herself, where she usually sits in\nsilent contemplation, listening to the whispers of the countless\nshades in her domain.",
