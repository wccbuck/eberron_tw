These heavy volcanic stones rearrange themselves to better fit your feet once you've [[attuned|attunement]] to them. Despite their appearance, the boots are comfortably light and warm. While wearing the boots, you have [[advantage]] to resist fire.

While wearing these boots, you can [[push yourself]] to stomp the ground and create a 5-foot-radius circle of volcanic activity centered on your boots. The ground and air become impossibly hot, and sulfuric gases rise into the air. You are immune to these effects as long as you wear the boots.

The volcanic effect lasts for 1 minute, until you choose to end it early, or you fall unconscious.
