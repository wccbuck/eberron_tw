title: hideous laughter
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this spell affects it. They become incapacitated and unable to stand up for up to a minute (less if it takes damage). A creature without sufficient intelligence to understand language isn't affected.
