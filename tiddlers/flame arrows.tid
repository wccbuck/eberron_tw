You touch a quiver containing arrows or bolts. When a target is hit by a ranged weapon attack using a piece of ammunition drawn from the quiver, the target bursts into flames at the point of impact. The spell's magic ends on a piece of ammunition when it strikes a surface, and the spell ends when twelve pieces of ammunition have been drawn from the quiver.
