        "text": "The Sulat (or //Sul'at//, meaning \"Firebound\") League was an [[Age of Giants]] civilization of [[titan]]s that dominated central [[Xen'drik]] and rivaled the [[Cul'sir Dominion]] in power. Their meritocratic society revolved around advanced [[arcane research|arcane magic]], specializing in the [[binding|elemental binding]] of [[fiend]]s and [[elemental]]s, as well as [[magebreeding]] and [[transmutation]]. \n\nThe Sulat League was founded by the Hellfire Titan [[Adaxus]] to stand against the threat of the [[Cul'sir Dominion]]. After centuries of conflict between the two empires, Adaxus was deposed and shackled for his increasingly destructive trafficking of [[fiend]]s, after which the League was ruled by a council of [[Five Luminaries]].\n\nSulat League arcanists are believed to have been responsible for the creation of the [[Moon Breaker]], the doomsday weapon used by [[Cul'sir]] to seal off the [[plane]] of [[Dal Quor]] from [[Eberron]]. They also created the [[drow]] as living weapons to deal with rebellious [[elves|elf]], and it's thought that [[fire giant]]s are remnants of the Sulat.\n\nThe knowledge and wisdom of the Sulat League was\nlost in the cataclysm that destroyed [[Xen'drik]], and the\n[[fire giant]]s fell into barbarism with their kin. One legacy\nof this civilization remains, however—the [[Sulatu]] [[drow]],\nwho still live in the ruined obsidian fortresses of their\nformer masters.\n\nThe [[Battalion of the Basalt Towers]], [[fire giant]] ancestors of the Sulat, seek to regain the knowledge of the Sulat League and reclaim the glory of Fire Prince [[Adaxus]]—and may be searching for ways to release the Hellfire Titan.",
