        "text": "The Sulat League was an [[Age of Giants]] civilization of titans in [[Xen'drik]], led by the legendary \"Fire Prince,\" Adaxus. They specialized in the [[binding|elemental binding]] of [[fiend]]s and [[elemental]]s, as well as [[magebreeding]]. They are believed to have been responsible for the creation of the [[Moon Breaker]], the doomsday weapon that sealed off the [[plane]] of [[Dal Quor]] from [[Eberron]]. They also created the [[drow]] as living weapons to deal with rebellious [[elves|elf]], and it's thought that [[fire giant]]s are remnants of the Sulat.\n\nThe knowledge and wisdom of the Sulat League was\nlost in the cataclysm that destroyed [[Xen'drik]], and the\n[[fire giant]]s fell into barbarism with their kin. One legacy\nof this civilization remains, howeverâ€”the [[Sulatu]] [[drow]],\nwho still live in the ruined obsidian fortresses of their\nformer masters.\n\nThe [[Battalion of the Basalt Towers]], [[fire giant]] ancestors of the Sulat, might some day seek to regain the knowledge of the Sulat League. At the moment, however, these giants exploit their physical might rather than arcane knowledge.",
