<div style="float: left; width: 100px;">{{$:/plugins/wccbuck/death.svg}}</div> Any citizen of the [[Five Nations]] can name the
twelve true [[dragonmark]]s. The marks are pillars
of modern society, cornerstones of the tools
people use every day. But there is another dragonmark. Few now
remember the thirteenth dragonmark, once an accepted member of the known houses, and once wiped from the world: the Mark of Death.

The Dragonmark of Death manifested on the
line of [[Vol]], a [[noble house|Aereni noble line]] of [[elves|elf]] in [[Aerenal]], around 2,600 years ago. The mark granted horrifying powers, and the line of Vol allied with a clan of evil [[dragon]]s, who planned to use the malevolent powers of the mark to dominate Aerenal and usher in an age of [[undead]] terrors. The elves of the [[Undying Court]] were forced to join forces with heroic dragons from [[Argonnessen]]. It was a bloody
war, but ultimately the champions of light and
life overcame the forces of darkness and death.
After careful study, the [[Sibling Kings]] of Aerenal
regretfully concluded that the Mark of Death
was deemed too dangerous to exist, and must
be completely eradicated for the greater good.
This meant the execution of everyone with
any connection to the bloodline of Vol, and the
dragons and the Aereni solemnly carried out this
sentence, erasing the Mark of Death from the
world.

At least, this is the tale as it is recorded in the
archives of [[Aerenal]]. Even though the line of [[Vol]]
was wiped out, they had allies. Some of these
allies were assimilated into the [[Aereni]] culture.
Many were killed along with the Vol, but some
fled to [[Khorvaire]] and spread out across the
continent. Most of these refugees abandoned
their old culture, though their beliefs inspired a
religion called the [[Blood of Vol]]. Those who dig
deep enough can find the history once told by
these renegades. These hidden secrets present
the line of Vol in a different light. The Vol were
accomplished [[necromancer|necromancy]]s, and preserved
their greatest citizens as [[mummies|mummy]], [[lich]]es,
and other [[undead]], much as the modern Aereni preserve their ancestors as [[deathless]]. They practiced these techniques peacefully for thousands of years, and
their philosophies dominated southern [[Aerenal]]. When the Mark of Death manifested, they embraced it as a gift to further their contribution
to their ancestors and society. The mark wasn’t
a weapon, but a tool that facilitated interaction
with the dead and undead. Its bearers were
master mediums, not cruel tyrants.

The stories did agree on one point. The line of
[[Vol]] sought to //understand// the Mark of Death, and
to this end they formed an alliance with a clan
of [[dragon]]s from [[Argonnessen]]. According to the
Vol’s version of the story, these dragons were
researchers, not conquerors. In their attempts
to unlock the secrets of the [[dragonmark]]s, they
began to breed [[dragon]]-[[elf]] hybrids, seeking to
produce what they called an apex dragonmark,
and this is ultimately what drew the wrath of
Argonnessen. The elder dragons of the [[Conclave]] had forbidden any sort of tampering with the [[Draconic Prophecy]], and the elves of the [[Undying Court]]
saw a chance to eliminate a long-time rival. If this version of the story is to be believed, the eradication of the line of Vol and the Mark of Death had nothing to do with saving the world, but it was instead about elven politics and the
dragons’ determination to contain and control
any possible manipulation of the Prophecy.

Was the line of [[Vol]] cruel tyrants determined
on building an [[undead]] empire, or innocent
researchers seeking answers to an important
arcane mystery? It hardly matters, as the [[last Vol heir|Lady Illmarrow]] died over a thousand years ago. Unless, of course, the Mark of Death returns.
