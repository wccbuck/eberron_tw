The current caretaker of the [[Pool of Onatar's Tears]] in the [[Cogs]] of [[Sharn]] is a [[warforged]] priest named Weld. Weld served in the [[Last War]]; along the way he developed a deep faith in [[Onatar]], who he believes guided [[human]]ity to create the warforged race. Smith believes that the god has a plan for the warforged, and he has done his best to get other members of the warforged community to embrace his vision. Smith is deeply opposed the violent ideology of the [[Lord of Blades]], and firmly believes that the warforged and the creatures of flesh are meant to live together.
