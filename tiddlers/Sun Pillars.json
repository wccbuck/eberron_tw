        "text": "The Sun Pillars are a rocky region of badlands and mesas in [[Xen'drik]], separating the [[Menechtarun Desert]] from the [[Wasting Plain]]. \n\nThis region is home to the ''Sohl'dhai'', a group of [[stone giant]]s with sandstone complexions. They live within homes carved into the Sun Pillars themselves, forming villages of interconnecting caverns alongside communities of [[kobold]]s. These giants worship the god Sohl'ara, a deity which may be a form of [[Dol Arrah]]. Sohl'dhai [[adept]]s and [[cleric]]s wield radiant [[divine magic]]; they use their command of [[sunlight|Sun]] to grow crops atop the mesas they call home, and call down searing sunbeams on approaching threats.\n\nAccording to scattered reports, the legendary [[behir]] [[Glimmerdoom]] may have been seen lurking in this region.",
