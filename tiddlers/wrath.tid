Wrath, also known as wrathweed or "alchemical wrath," is a combat elixir developed during the [[Last War]] that evokes strong aggression when consumed. When taken in large enough quantities, it can send a creature into a berserk fury, not unlike a [[barbarian]]'s rage—though the user experiences a great deal of exhaustion once the effects of the drug have worn off. Wrath is also a powerful painkiller.

While many warriors find wrath to be exhilarating, it is not actually addictive—at least, not chemically. However, repeatedly using wrath within a 24-hour period can cause serious harm, or even death.
