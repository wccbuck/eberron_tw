Genasi are [[plane]]-touched [[humanoid]]s infused with elemental power. Rarer even than other planetouched beings such as [[tiefling]]s and [[aasimar]], genasi result from pacts and machinations of [[genie]]s with mortals of the Material Plane, and wield powers related to one of the four main types of genies ([[dao]], [[efreeti]], [[marid]], or [[djinni]]).
