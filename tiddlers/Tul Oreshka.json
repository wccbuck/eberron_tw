        "text": "Fearsome truths hide in the shadowsâ€”the hidden thoughts of those you consider your friends, the terrible deeds of ancestors, the moment of your death. Tul Oreshka embodies these horrible secrets. Her actions are never predictable, and she is as much a threat to her allies as to her enemies. Anyone who feels her influence might suffer nightmares or hear terrible things in ghostly whispers. Heralded by a wave of madness, her release would shatter minds the world over.",
