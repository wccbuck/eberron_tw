Folly is the [[barony]] of [[Fortune's Fool]]. Here, great misfortunes
regularly occur, but invariably lead to unlikely success. Folly contains
a charming village and a number of threats—a [[dragon]], a [[giant]]—
that can't be defeated with weapons alone. However, other actions can be used to achieve things that might seem impossible in reality. For example, one could convince the dragon to eat its own hoard. This is a place where wits are more important than brawn, though it
may take time for the adventurers to discover this.

A strong [[manifest zone]] to Folly can be found in southern [[Droaam]]. The phenomenon of [[nilbogism|nilbog]] can be observed here.
