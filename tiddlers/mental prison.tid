You attempt to bind a creature within an illusory cell that only it perceives. One creature you can see within 60 feet (that isn't immune to being charmed) must resist your magic or else it suffers psychic damage and you make the area immediately around the target appear dangerous to it in some way. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can't see or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for up to one minute. If the target is moved out of the [[illusion]], makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes a great deal of psychic damage, and the spell ends.
