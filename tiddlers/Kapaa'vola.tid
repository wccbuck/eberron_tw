The //Kapaa'vola//, or "Treacherous Whisper", was the psychic contagion that destroyed the ancient [[goblinoid]] empire of [[Dhakaan]].

!! End of an Empire

The golden age of [[Dhakaan]] lasted over five millennia, with
[[goblin]]s ruling over the lands that would later be claimed by
[[Galifar]]. As the legend suggests, this prosperous era ended with
the [[Xoriat]] incursion, when the [[daelkyr]] led armies of [[aberration]]s
into [[Khorvaire]]. The daelkyr destroyed Dhakaani cities and
transformed [[goblinoid]]s into aberrations, such as [[dolgaunt]]s and
[[dolgrim]]s. After a long and bitter struggle, Dhakaani champions
turned the tide. The [[orc]] [[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]] [[druid]]s bound the daelkyr in
[[Khyber]], but it was Dhakaani warriors who scattered their armies
and hunted down the beasts that survived. 

But as legend tells,
the [[daelkyr]] achieved victory even in defeat. [[Dyrrn]] the Corruptor
created a psychic contagion that severed [[goblinoid]]s from the [[Uul Dhakaan]], and further encouraged chaotic behavior and irrational
beliefs. Leaders among the [[duur'kala|dirge singer]] identified the threat but couldn't
find a way to stop it; isolation was the only answer. Determined
to preserve their culture, Dhakaani forces sealed themselves
in subterranean fortresses, vowing to return only after the
''Kapaa'vola''—the Treacherous Whisper—had faded. These armies
called themselves the [[Kech Dhakaan|Heirs of Dhakaan]], Keepers of the Empire—a term still used today to encompass all Dhakaani clans.

On the surface, the remnants of the empire fragmented
and collapsed. As far as the Kech Dhakaan are concerned,
the history of the Empire of [[Dhakaan]] came to an end the
moment [[Dyrrn]] the Corruptor unleashed the Kapaa'vola.
But in truth, the empire lingered for centuries after the
Keepers left; the wider world doesn't even know the term
Kapaa'vola, and history books consider the fall of Dhakaan
to be a long and ugly affair. Dyrrn's curse caused paranoia
and wild beliefs to flourish, further driving the survivors apart. The discipline and knowledge of Dhakaan were lost,
and the traditions of the daashor—[[artificer]]s of Dhakaan—
and the dirge singers were forgotten. New religions and cults
emerged. Some tribes embraced the [[Dark Six]], while others
revered a wider pantheon. Under [[Dhakaan]], the [[goblinoid]]
subspecies were united; in the wake of the Kapaa'vola, the
strong dominated the weak. Some tribes developed unusual
and complex traditions, while others were cruel and feral.
When [[human]] explorers found these warring tribes living in
the ruins of grand cities, many assumed that the goblinoids
had claimed the remnants of a human civilization they
destroyed.
