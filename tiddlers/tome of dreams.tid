This beautifully embossed book is full of gripping short stories. You can read a story from the book in about 10 minutes. The underlying nature of each story is unclear, leaving your subconscious mind to slowly process and unpack its deeper meanings over the course of your next rest of 6 hours or more. The next time you finish a long rest after reading a story from the book, you have a <<drp "50% chance" "Lose 1 stress box for 6 hours." "Gain 1 temporary stress box that lasts for 6 hours.">> to have suffered intense terrors during the night, causing you to lose access to 1 [[stress]] box for 6 hours; otherwise, your mind is filled with joy and courage instead, causing you to gain 1 extra [[stress]] box that lasts for 6 hours. If you start a story but don't finish reading it, nothing happens the next time you finish a long rest.
