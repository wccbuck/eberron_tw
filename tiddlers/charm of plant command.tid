This fist-sized charm is made from a bundle of dried plant stems wrapped in silver thread. Hung on a leather thong, it is typically worn around the neck or attached to a belt.

This charm has 3 charges. While you bear the charm, you can expend 1 charge to cast the [[speak with plants]] spell. For the duration of the spell, you also have [[advantage]] on attempts made to influence the behavior, demeanor, and attitude of plants. The charm regains all expended charges at dawn each day.
