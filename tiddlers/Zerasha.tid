A fearsome combatant and gifted [[cleric]] of the [[Shadow]],
the [[medusa]] priest Zerasha holds court at the Eye of the Shadow temple on the [[Street of Shadows]] in [[Graywall]]. She is the most influential voice in [[Graywall]] after
[[Xorchylic]]; the people of the town have come to trust her oracular gifts. At the moment, she is an ally of the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]], but her first loyalty is to the [[Shadow]] and to her own [[warlord]], the [[Queen of Stone]]. Should there ever be a civil war in [[Graywall]], the black-scaled medusa will be a force with which to be reckoned.
