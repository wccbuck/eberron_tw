        "text": "Hruitt (councilor for [[Middle Dura]]) is a mysterious figure on the [[Sharn Council]], keeping his own counsel and advancing his own agenda. He is an intelligent [[giant owl]] who can assume a [[human]] form (or perhaps a human [[druid]] who prefers to stay in the form of a giant owl; no one is quite sure). He once was an aerial racer, representing the [[Bazaar]] of [[Dura]] in the [[Race of Eight Winds]]. Hruitt's primary responsibility is to the merchants of the Bazaar, protecting their interests from the [[Boromar|Boromar Clan]] councilors and the councilors who represent the other market wards. ",
