type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Cavallah is a disciplined [[oni]] and the current leader of the [[Daask]] cell in [[Sharn]]. She is the mastermind of the organization's machinations against the [[Boromar Clan]], a scholar obsessed with studying Sharn's [[manifest zone]], and a devoted servant of [[Sora Katra]]. The oni wears a [[hag eye]] that enables Sora Katra to both see and hear what occurs in her presence.

Like many [[oni]], a [[fiend]] is bound in Cavallah's bloodline which influences her personality and grants her a degree of supernatural power. Cavallah's fiend is the [[incubus|incubus/succubus]] ''Usalar'', the Treacherous Blade, a spirit of cruel deceit and a child of [[Eldrantulku]] the Oathbreaker. The oni can't speak directly with the incubus, but Usalar's power is in her blood, granting her instincts that make her an exceptional conniver.
