type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Based on the "Salted Legacy" adventure in Journeys through the Radiant Citadel.

!! Summary

A series of disturbances plagues the Dinsiin Night Market, an endlessly changing maze of stalls filled with incredible wares, enticing smells, and magical lights. Accusations fly as the characters become entangled in a feud between the well-respected Tyenmo and Zunguun merchant families of [[Starilaskur]]. To prevent the families' conflict form escalating, the characters must earn the trust of the market's vendors and gain their help to unmask who's behind a rash of vandalism and thefts.

!! Background

The Zunguun and Tyenmo families have always had a complicated relationship. While their trades and relationships to the Dinsiin Night Market differ, their stubbornness and intense family loyalty are the same. Both believe they're paragons of what a night market merchant should be while also believing the other family has been jealously sabotaging them for years. Despite this, the current heads of the two families, Lamai Tyenmo and Kusa Zunguun, have vowed not to continue what is now a multigenerational rivalry. These family heads have even begun to seek each other's counsel and plant the seeds of friendship. But in recent weeks, thefts and vandalism targeting both families' businesses have rekindled old suspicions, and the feud threatens to reignite.

!! Hooks

The group seeks a rare treasure, local delicacy, or expert artisan only available at the night market. Alternatively, they want to sell a possession or to obtain an appraisal from a merchant with an unusual specialty.

* Possibly we could say [[Dowin Lin Adredar]] needs to get something appraised or to obtain something. Asks for Arien's help. She could then ask [[Roak]] or [[Turanank]] for help.
* Need to hold off on this until after the winter passes. The market might not be a year-round thing since it gets cold in Starilaskur, and has a grand opening in late spring.

!! Market Info

Hundreds of temporary stalls, tents, and vendor carts fill the Batuuk district with wonders to tempt even the pickiest customers. The shops surround three golden tents in a sunken plaza. Merchants set up during the afternoon, but most don't open until twilight when the evening's cool air attracts customers.

The vendors are a tight-knit community, and many have attended the market for decades. Their wares vary from common goods to rarities. Some merchants price their wares plainly; others haggle, trade, or exchange goods for favors. Notable shops in the market include the following:

* ''Madam Kulp's Silk.'' This store sells luxurious silk garments for no less than [[5c|money]] apiece.
* ''Spicy Brothers.'' This stall sells spices, peppers, and spicy dishes like cucumber fire smoothies and honey-glazed hot chips. (These are more akin to southern Brelish cuisine. Other examples: fire-wrapped golden fish, orange pepper pork, hot-spiced chicken in panya leaves)
* ''Trusty Leek.'' This street food cart specializes in bite-sized and skewered seafood dishes. It relocates regularly throughout the evening.
* ''Tyenmo Noodles.'' This food vendor offers vegetarian noodle bowls made with handmade noodles and fresh green tree beans.
* ''Vada's Otherworldly Goods.'' This shop sells pastries and desserts. The signature vanilla bun is made from a secret family recipe.
* ''Va's Lucky Amulets.'' This shop hocks a mixture of charms and curios, including some that the owner claims fend off sickness and animal attacks. (nonmagical [[trinket]]s)
* ''Zunguun Family Seafood.'' This food vendor sells fishcakes, fresh wailing slug, diamand-throated carp, etc.
* ''Nyvrn Candy Cart'' sells an array of magical and cursed candies. Potential effects of the candies include:
** Your footfalls emit musical notes
** You foam at the mouth, making it difficult to speak
** Your fingers leave stains on anything you touch
** Your head swells to twice its normal size
** Fireflies are drawn to you and form a persistent cloud around you
* ''Hiccup's Generally Nice Goods'' barters "discounted" [[Mror|Mror Holds]] rugs and "semi-genuine" painted porcelain from [[Syrkarn]].
* A food cart with a [[Talenta|Talenta Plains]] [[halfling]] merchant might sell [[halodan mealworms]]
* Other food carts sell northern Brelish food such as beef boranel (beef stuffed with bread and mushrooms), farmer's stew, thrice-poached eggs, kettle-fried spider with redeye berries.

!! Misc Notes

Instead of Kasem randomly running into some little wynlings and befriending them, he has a box of "windlings" (as in to wind a watch, they look like wind-up toys), which he took from the workshop of [[Granny Nightshade|Skabatha Nightshade]]. Or perhaps he found them in an old toy workshop in Starilaskur and knew they were fey-made. The instructions (written or perhaps spoken by a [[fey]] emissary of Nightshade) say that the windlings would perform one favor for you if you wind them up and whisper your request. It would perform the favor "to the best of its ability, at the cost of the least of yours."

Throughout the adventure, Kasem winds up a windling and sends it off to sabotage a market stall. However, each time he does this, he suffers a mild curse, losing "the least of" his abilities. When the party meets Kasem, he's already lost the ability to tie or untie rope. He whistles when they meet him. The next time they see him, he's lost the ability to whistle. Other minor curses:

* Can't catch items thrown at him
* Cannot turn right
* Cannot conceptualize "eleven"
