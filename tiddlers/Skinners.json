        "text": "The [[Mockery]] is the Sovereign of murder and treachery, and the Skinners believe that he guides their hands. This gang of monsters in [[Graywall]] actively preys on the\npeople of the east, killing foreigners foolish enough to leave the safety of the [[Calabas]]â€”and occasionally venturing within its walls to target an outspoken follower of the [[Silver Flame]] or [[paladin]] of [[Dol Arrah]]. When possible, the Skinners take victims alive so they can be tortured slowly. The leader of this gang is the [[oni]] ''Zurin Souldrinker''; his touch can magically strip the skin from a victim. His strong second is ''Gray Garrak'', a vicious [[bugbear]] with a remarkable gift for slaughter.",
