Bortan ir'Wynarn is the eldest living son of King [[Boranel ir'Wynarn]] of [[Breland]]. He holds the post of royal steward, and controls the crown's finances. Though Bortan is technically next in line to rule, he has not shown an impressive sense of command or leadership abilities, and many Brelish worry about what the future holds when it comes to the impending succession. In fact, a large contingent of the [[Breland Parliament]], led by Lord [[Ruken ir'Clarn]], seeks to dissolve the monarchy once Boranel dies.
