Grapes grown in some of the fey vineyards of [[Thelanis]] are so lush that even when they are dried and made into raisins, they retain most of the grapes' essence and potential. When a feywine raisin is stirred into a goblet of water, the raisin dissolves and the mixture instantly ferments, creating wine.
