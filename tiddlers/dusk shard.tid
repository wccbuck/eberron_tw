title: dusk shard
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A dusk shard is special variety of Eberron [[dragonshard]] found only in [[Q'barra]]. Dusk shards are a smoky gray with vivid red veins, and possess remarkable magical qualities. They are worth five times as much as standard [[dragonshard]]s of similar size.

The miners of [[Q'barra]] have yet to discover the source of this unusual power. The truth is that the dusk shards hold fragments of the essence of the immortal [[overlord]] [[Masvirik]] and his fiendish agents. As a result, using these dragonshards may result in unexpected effects. For example, someone using dusk shards for [[divination]] rituals could receive messages directly from Masvirik, or misleading information that serves the purposes of the overlord.

Dusk shards channel Masvirik's darkness and split it into tiny pieces. Together with the network of [[dawn shard]]s planted in the earth, the Cold Sun remains bound. The [[Poison Dusk]] seeks to gather the dusk shards to help them commune with [[Masvirik]] and eventually release it from its bonds.
