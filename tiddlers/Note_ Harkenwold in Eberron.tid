title: Note: Harkenwold in Eberron
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Iron Circle is the primary antagonist of the well-regarded D&D 4th edition adventure //The Reavers of Harkenwold//, found in the [[Dungeon Master's Kit|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/121978/Dungeon-Masters-Kit-4e]]. A GM can place the county of Harkenwold anywhere in rural [[Breland]] (or elsewhere in the [[Five Nations]]) where it makes sense for their story. In the adventure, the Iron Circle is a vanguard of an invading enemy nation; in this document, I've instead made it a disgraced mercenary troop and [[Cult of the Dragon Below|Cults of the Dragon Below]], with Nazin Redthorn as its primary leader rather than just a general.
