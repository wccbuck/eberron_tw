This land\nstill bears scars from the battles during the [[Age of Demons]]. It was the seat of [[fiend]]ish power in Argonnessen in the first age, and ruins built by twisted\n[[rakshasa]] hands are still found across the territory, \n\n!!

Industries\n\nThe [[Light of Siberys]] maintains a host of armories and\narcane workshops in its fortresses. It has been creating\ntools of war for nearly a hundred thousand years. The\nforges of [[Verthicha'vivex]] produce weapons and armor\nfor the [[dragonborn]] and nondragon allies of the [[dragon]]s, and for those\ndragons that choose to fight in [[humanoid]] form. Other\ndragons create [[magic item]]s and lesser artifacts that can\nbe used by dragons in battle. Much of the manual labor\nis done by [[dwarves|dwarf]] and [[giant]]s, but [[flames of the forge|flame of the forge]]\ndevelop designs and provide the spell power needed to\ncraft [[magic item]]s.\n\nDespite this strong industrial program, the Light of Siberys rarely exports any of its goods. All are needed for\nthe task at hand... or the battles to come.\n\n!! Life and Society\n\nThe Light of Siberys is made up of [[dragon]]s of all colors\nand ages. Although some of the [[dragon]]s are “trueborn”\nor “born in the Light”—to families that have served the\ncause for generations—the majority of the young dragons\ncome from the [[Thousand]]. Young adult dragons of the\nThousand are forced to spend fifty years in the [[Vast]] or\nserve for fifty years in the Light of Siberys before they\ncan return to claim land in the Thousand. Some choose\nto remain after the term is up, but life in the Light is\nintense, dangerous, and often thankless. Moreover, it\nclashes with the independent streak that runs through\nthe psyche of the dragon. Most are glad to return to the\npeace of the Thousand.\n\nA soldier of the [[Light|Light of Siberys]] is dedicated to his duty.\nMissions abound, from patrolling the skies to standing watch over the [[Pit of Five Sorrows]] to hunting down the [[Talons of Tiamat]]. Young adults might be frivolous,\nparticularly those forced to work for the Light by the customs of the [[Thousand]]. Any adult or older [[dragon]] who chooses to abandon the safer life of the Thousand\nfor the deadly duty of the Light, however, is a stern and\nimplacable foe.\n\n!! Government and Politics\n\nThe [[dragon]]s of the [[Light of Siberys]] follow a strict chain\nof command. Although they normally patrol in squads of five or fewer, they are trained to\noperate in large numbers, and even the lowest-ranking officers, the Lanterns of Siberys, are trained to organize other dragons in times of war. Currently five dragons hold the rank of Glorious Flame. Only one Eternal Flame exists, the Lightkeeper [[Dolarashynach]], and she guides the Soldiers of the Light from [[Verthicha'vivex]], the Mountain of Victory.\n\nFor the most part, the dragons who serve the Light of Siberys are deeply devoted to their cause. However, exceptions exist. Some simply develop a taste for power\nand influence. Others are corrupted by the fiendish\npresences they combat. Regardless of the reason, a few\ndragons have sought to use their rank within the Light\nfor their own personal benefit. Indeed, it could be that\none of the current Glorious Flames is waiting for the\nright moment to help [[Dolarashynach]] move on to her\neternal reward.\n\n!! Nondragons in the Light of Siberys\n\nThe nondragons found in the Light of Siberys are closely\ntied to the military efforts of the order. The [[stone giant]]s and [[dragonborn]] serve as the backbone of the nondragon army and also help with the construction of fortifications and other large-scale projects. The [[dwarves|dwarf]] are largely dedicated\nto forgework and mining. A force of [[hobgoblin]]s and\n[[bugbear]]s, descended from warriors of [[Dhakaan]], have\nmaintained the martial discipline of the empire; while their empire has fallen, and they have been cut off from the [[Uul Dhakaan]], they are sworn to battle the horrors of [[Khyber]]. A few [[human]]s and others from the city of [[Io'lokar]] have joined with the Light. In so doing, they hope to assuage any doubts the [[Conclave]] might have about\ntheir loyalty.\n\nUnless foreigners can successfully pass as nondragons in the service of the Light, they are met with hostility. This territory is filled with dangerous sources of power and strongholds of the [[Talons of Tiamat]]—it is a bad place to be a trespasser.\n\n!! Important Sites\n\nThe [[Light of Siberys]] maintains watchtowers across this land, along with five fortresses and the mountain keep [[Verthicha'vivex]]. A watchtower is a tall pillar of magically reinforced stone with an aerie near the top. Limited barracks are located at the base for nondragon troops, but only fliers can reach the upper chambers. Architecture is simple and functional, blending magic and expert stonework. Beyond these fortifications, the region mixes wilderness with traces of the terrible wars of the [[Age of Demons]].\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[location]sort[title]]:filter[get[text]length[]compare:integer:gt[200]]\">>\n\n!! Adventure Seeds\n\nThe Light of Siberys is an immensely dangerous place for adventurers; it’s just a question of whether they’re killed by [[dragon]]s, [[fiend]]s, or cultists. However, amazing secrets and treasures are hidden in the ruins of the [[Age of Demons]]. Beyond that, what wonders have the dragons produced in their hidden forges? For those\nwho can brave the many dangers, the rewards should\nbe astonishing.\n\n''Haunted Weapon:'' A tablet dating back to the [[Age of Demons]] tells the story of [[Katashka]] the Gatekeeper and the [[Harvest of Pain]]. The tablet suggests the presence of an artifact weapon of immense power, never recovered because the [[dragon]]s couldn’t face the [[ghost]]s haunting the field. Can the party find a way into the depths to recover the blade? And is the weapon a tool that can be turned to good, or is it pure evil?\n\n''Sorrow’s Path:'' To destroy a deadly artifact, the party must shatter it atop [[Tiamat]]’s crystal at the very bottom of the [[Pit of Five Sorrows]]. Can the PCs convince the [[dragon]]s to aid them in their quest, or will the [[rakshasa]]s laugh as heroes and dragons do battle?",
