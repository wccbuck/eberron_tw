The successful middle class of [[Tavick's Landing]] live
in Little Barrington. Overseers from the [[Blackbone Cogs|Blackbones]], junior barristers and aspiring government
functionariesâ€”anyone who can't afford a home in
the [[upper ward]]s but is too successful to live in
[[Kenton]] or one of the lower districts. It is quiet and
peaceful, and frequent patrols by the [[Sharn Watch]]
ensure that it stays that way.
