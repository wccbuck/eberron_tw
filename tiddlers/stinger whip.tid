type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This whip is made from the tail of a [[bone devil]] or another creature with a stinger. The creature's venomous gland can be filled with a poison of the wielder's choice, and that poison can be delivered with deadly efficiency with a whip crack. Any poison applied with this weapon lasts twice as long and/or is twice as effective.
