Dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. Their size alone strikes awe into the hearts of most who witness them; adult dragons have wingspans of about 40 feet, while the wingspans of the most ancient dragons can be as much as 60 feet. The dragons of [[Eberron]] are much more than mere
monsters; adventurers will rarely barge into a dragon's
lair in search of its treasure horde. Dragons in the world
are either aloof and unapproachable, or they are curious
and manipulative, pulling strings behind the scenes or
trying to influence the world in arcane ways.

In addition to deadly tooth and claw and tail, dragons wield the ability to exhale jets of raw elemental energy. These breath weapons are fearsome, but take up to a minute to recharge after use. See the //Colors and Breath Weapons// section below for more information. Dragons also possess [[darkvision]] as well as short-range [[blindsight]], and many can innately cast [[arcane|arcane magic]] spells.

Most dragons live on the mystery-shrouded continent
of [[Argonnessen]] and avoid contact with those they see as
lesser creatures. They are obsessed with the [[Draconic Prophecy]], which is a map of possible futures rather
than a clear-cut prediction. Its paths are revealed in the
motion of [[plane]]s and moons, in the actions of the [[dragonmarked house]]s, and in dozens of other more subtle
manifestations. These dragons are bound by the decisions of the mysterious [[Conclave]]. Most dragons that are active in [[Khorvaire]] are part of a cabal known as the [[Chamber]].

A dragon in [[Khorvaire]] that isn't part of the Chamber is considered a [[rogue dragon]]. They could be an exile driven from [[Argonnessen]] for some
crime, or a scholar pursuing independent research. Some orphaned dragons grow up in Khorvaire without contact with Argonnessen, and some dragons have
been twisted by the [[daelkyr]] or corrupted by [[fiend]]s; any
of these could be an antagonist if the adventure you're
crafting calls for a cruel dragon.

The dragons of Eberron aren't restricted in alignment—good [[red dragon]]s and evil [[gold dragon]]s are equally common. Most dragons tend toward neutrality. Even those with good alignments often don't consider the impact of their actions on lesser beings; if a [[Chamber]] dragon must destroy a [[human]] village to foil the plans of a [[demon]], it will do so without hesitation. 

!! Dragon Names

Dragon names tend to the long and unpronounceable (at least for the lesser races). When interacting with other creatures, dragons either use a diminutive, create a descriptive nickname, or insist that the creature attempt to use its full name.

!! Colors and Breath Weapons

Dragons are magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities. The type of a dragon's breath weapon can be determined by the color of the dragon's scales; see the below tables. The dragon is also resistant or immune to that type of damage. Note that metallic dragons have two different kinds of magic breath they can use; one destructive, and one more subtle or utilitarian. Chromatic dragons only have destructive breath weapons, but it is typically more powerful than those of comparable metallic dragons.

Very rarely, the most ancient of dragons can achieve a form of apotheosis, transforming into [[greatwyrm]]s. 

!! Origin of the Dragons

According to the draconic faith known as [[Thir]], the birth of the first dragons predates even the rising of the [[overlord]]s. In the wake of the battle of the [[Progenitors|Progenitor Dragons]], life emerged
on the new world. [[Siberys]] had fallen in battle, but power
remained within his blood. Filled with the purest essence
of magic, that blood fell on [[Eberron]], merging life and
magic to produce new creatures with the strength of both
Progenitors. Where the blood of Siberys struck
the clouds, [[silver dragon]]s were born. It fell on the cold
peaks, and [[white dragon]]s rose from the ice. It struck
the swamps, and [[black dragon]]s emerged from the dark
depths. And so all the dragons were born, mighty and
proud, possessing the mystical power of Siberys and the
vibrant life force of Eberron.

Few of the creatures of the modern age existed at
the dawn of time. The [[titan|giant]]s of [[Xen'drik]] were in their
infancy, possessed of power but lacking knowledge. The
lesser races had not been born; the dark creatures had
not been spawned. So it was that wild flights of dragons
soared above the world, reveling in their might.

For untold millennia, the dragons were the sole lords of
Eberron. Then a new threat emerged. [[Khyber]] was bound
in the depths of Eberron, but this did not eliminate the
dark dragon’s power. In time, a host of horrors spawned
in the depths. The mighty [[overlord]]s, served by [[rakshasa]]s, [[aboleth]]s, and other terrors, emerged to lay claim to the world above. The [[Age of Demons]] had begun.

!! Psionics and Dragons

For dragons, the path of [[psionics]] is a dangerous one. An innate connection to [[arcane magic]] flows in a dragon's blood, and for reasons not fully understood, psionic power often twists and debases this force. Among those dragons who explore the psionic mysteries, the fortunate suffer only disfigurement and ill health. Many develop debilitating insanity, then ultimately die. It's possible that the vicious [[Sarlona]]n [[aberration]]s known as [[essence reaver]]s are the result of failed attempts by ancient [[dragon]]s to command the power of [[psionics]].

!! Draconic Creatures

Some creatures share a common ancestry with true dragons, but are not true dragons themselves. Below are some examples.
