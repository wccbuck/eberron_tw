        "text": "A great tropical rainforest fills the southeastern portion of [[Breland]], from the [[Dagger River]] in the west to the [[Trolan River]] (now part of [[Zilargo]]) in the east, from the [[Howling River]] in the north to [[Khorvaire]]'s southern coast. The King's Forest is a hunting preserve that once belonged to the [[Galifar]] king and now falls under the protection of Breland's crown. The [[Knight Rangers|King's Shields]] patrol the rainforest, watching for poachers and trying to keep in check the bandits and brigands who hide within its depths. Since the [[Treaty of Thronehold]], the easter portion of the forest has been part of [[Zilargo]]. It isn't unusual for bands of brigands to flee across the border as they try to evade the Brelish rangers.\n\nOnce, the King's Forest covered the entire southern half of Breland, cut in half by the mighty [[Dagger River]]. Logging and cultivation have reduced the forest's size over the centuries, and a royal decree was necessary to preserve the portion of forest that remains. All kinds of tropical plants, insects and wildlife fill the King's Forest. Hunting, except by permit or royal invitation, is strictly prohibited. In the fall season, the king and his court, as well as honored guests, enter the King's Forest to participate in a Great Hunt.\n\nThe [[Jungle Boys]], a band of bloodthirsty brigands, hide within the King's Forest.
