Before the founding of [[Galifar]], Margana Lain was an early pioneer of [[arcane magic]], convinced that what the [[fey]] seemed to do by whim, mortals could master through will. Over the course of her life she made dramatic breakthroughs in the basic techniques of [[illusion]] and [[enchantment]] magic. While she was a [[wizard]] whose powers were based on arcane science, many stories that followed called her //Margana the Fey//, claiming that through her studies, she sought to become an [[archfey]]. [[Arcanix]]-trained mages may refer to [[disguise self]] as //Margana’s masque//; [[invisibility]] as //Margana’s veil//; and [[lesser illusion]] as //Margana’s mirror// (according to legend, Margana would weave images in a mirror, then pull them out into the world). In the present day, the ir’Lains are a proud [[Aundair]]ian dynasty; [[Darro ir'Lain]] is Second Warlord of the Realm and Commander of the [[Knights Arcane]].

Beyond her own accomplishments, Margana was instrumental in the creation of the [[Guild of Moonlight and Whispers]], the first true [[wizard’s circle|arcane order]] of the [[Five Nations]].

!! Adventure Hook: Margana the Fey Makes an Offer

Did Margana succeed in becoming an [[archfey]]? If so, she would be a native archfey of [[Eberron]], not unlike the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]]. But even then, her transformation would not be known for certain; while many [[Aundair]]ian noble families have ancient pacts with the anchor barons of [[Thelanis]], the ir'Lain family does not have this type of relationship with their distant ancestor.

Perhaps this Mistress of Moonlight and Whispers could appear to Queen [[Aurala ir'Wynarn]] in great splendor, and present herself as a sort of "patron [[archfey]]" of the nation of [[Aundair]]. Margana could make an offer to the Queen, providing a [[fey]] army for the nation of Aundair that could allow Aurala to conquer the [[Five Nations]] and reunite [[Galifar]]. But in truth, even as an archfey, Margana Lain would not truly possess this power... and the entity that has appeared before Aurala is not Margana at all, but [[Hektula]] the Bloody Scribe, Herald of the [[Keeper of Secrets|Sul Khatesh]], seeking to spread fear of magic across [[Khorvaire]].
