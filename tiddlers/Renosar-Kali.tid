Renosar-Kali, a [[silver|silver dragon]] [[rogue dragon]] in [[Xen'drik]], once witnessed [[Ketheptis]] lay waste to a tribe of [[drow]]. He fell instantly in love with the terrifying [[silver dragon]], hoping to mate with her and raise her children. When he approached the wrathful female, she nearly tore him to pieces. Now Renosar-Kali nurses his wounds and pride. [[Ketheptis]]â€™s violent rejection fills him with ferocious hate for her, but even so he cannot quell his attraction.
