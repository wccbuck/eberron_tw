The most beautiful and striking of all lesser and greater [[devil]]s, the erinyes are fierce and disciplined warriors. Sweeping down from the skies, they bring swift death to creatures that have wronged their masters or defied the edicts of the [[Iron Ward]]. The erinyes appear as male or female [[humanoid]]s with statuesque builds and large feathery wings. Most wear stylized armor and horned helms, and carry exquisite swords and bows. A few also use [[ropes of entanglement|rope of entanglement]] to ensnare powerful foes.
