''District Type:'' [[Halfling|halfling]] encampment<br/>
''Buildings:'' Council hall, temple ([[Boldrei]]), shrine
([[Balinor]]), average lodging (20), average food (37),
average trades (60), average services (40), average
residences (200)<br/>
''First Impression:'' The towers here appear inside-out; instead of open central spaces surrounded by
buildings attached to the outside of a tower, streets
run around the outsides of the towers, giving access
to very low doorways leading to cavelike interiors.
Halflings seem to negotiate these outside ledges with
ease, and so do the [[dinosaur]]s many of them ride.
Great winged reptiles soar between towers, many
with halfling riders on their backs.<br/>
''Social Class:'' Middle class<br/>
''Neighbors:'' [[Everbright]] (northwest); [[Smoky Towers]] (north); [[Deathsgate]] (bridge, southeast); [[Little Barrington]] (bridge, south); [[Firelight]] (below); [[Platinate]] (above)

Little Plains is not the only [[halfling]] neighborhood in
[[Sharn]], but it is the only district almost entirely inhabited by halflings and the only significant concentration
west of the [[Mournland]] of halfling immigrants from
the [[Talenta Plains]]. Even the architecture suggests
the maintenance of these halflings' traditional ways,
since the towers resemble the city of [[Gatherhold]]
in Talenta. More urbanized halflings live in Little
Plains as well, as do some few members of other races
(primarily [[gnome]]s and some [[kobold]]s).
