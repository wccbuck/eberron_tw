        "text": "Breland's occupation of southeast [[Thrane]] came to an end in [[987 YK|Khorvaire calendar]] at the Battle of Cairn Hill. General [[Nystrum Shadar]] of Thrane—later the Director of the [[Argentum]]—defeated [[Breland]] on the Fields of Rhone, just south of [[Cairn Hill]]. This intense battle was fought between two veteran and highly decorated armies, and it lasted four full days.\n\n[[Thrane]]'s forces included [[Cardinal|Council of Cardinals]] Moctin's \"Exultant Guards\" as well as three companies of the elite [[paladin]] unit known as the Avenging Hand. [[Breland]]'s forces included several famous [[wandslinger]] companies, including the Firebrands, the Blues and Irons, and the Roses of [[Sharn]]. Breland also secured the assistance of several regiments of [[Darguun]] [[hobgoblin]]s. Finally, and perhaps most famously, King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] deployed [[Chydris]], the first and most celebrated of Breland's floating fortresses.\n\nOn the third day of the battle, a piloting error caused [[Chydris]] to plow into the ground as it attempted to shift position. The forces of [[Thrane]] quickly exploited this situation and succeeded in overrunning the grounded fortress, destroying its delicate control mechanisms. Chydris would never float again.\n\nThe battle continued for an additional day before [[Breland]] was forced to retreat to [[Castle Rhonewatch]] and later [[Lurching Tower]]. [[Thrane]] had successfully reclaimed the Fields of Rhone, but both sides suffered severe casualties.",
