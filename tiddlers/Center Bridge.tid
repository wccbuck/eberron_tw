Center Bridge tries to be a quiet residential district,
but with [[Torchfire]] and [[Firelight]] on one side and
[[Downstairs]] on the other it can't help but smolder
with seedy activity. Its residents include a number of
people associated with [[Morgrave University]], since it
is located directly below the [[University District]] and
it offers much cheaper housing than can be found
in the ward above. In fact, groups of students share
inexpensive housing here, so close to the illicit
pleasures of [[Lower Menthis]], and are responsible for
much of the rowdiness that sometimes disturbs the
peace of Center Bridge.

In this [[lower ward]], the bases of the towers are hundreds of feet across, and they are ringed with townhomes that jut out from the towersâ€™ outer walls like the
teeth of enormous cogs.
