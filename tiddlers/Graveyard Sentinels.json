Many of these sad souls are as tattered and broken as the landscape of rail carts they wander. Most were maimed in the [[Last War]] and are missing one or more limbs. Others were abducted and abused or permanently disfigured by anti-warforged extremists in the days immediately following the Thronehold accords, and now hobble about the Graveyard with half their heads caved in, or with missing eyes. Many hide from intruders, or, rendered hopelessly insane by their torments, simply gibber at them nonsensically. But a few known as the Graveyard Sentinels have banded together under the leadership of a petty tyrant named [[Opilion]], who has an arachnid-like lower body chassis.\n\nOpilion's core cadre includes a total of nine veterans of the [[Last War]]. They do not take lightly to intruders and will attempt to ambush any they see as a threat.",
