Roerith remained in Korth throughout the [[Cyran|Cyre]] siege in the early 970s YK, heedless of her own safety as she healed fallen defenders atop the walls. Accordingly, she’s one of the city’s greatest heroes. \n\nRoerith has strongly negative sentiments towards the practice of the [[Blood of Vol]] faith and urges Vassals of the [[Sovereign Host]] to oppose its practice.",
