He then attempted to conquer and unite the other four burgeoning [[human]] kingdoms of [[Khorvaire]], but was unsuccessful.\n\nOther than forming [[Karrnath]], Karrn is also known for writing the [[Analects of War]], for establishing [[Dreadhold]], and possibly even creating the strategy game known as [[Conqueror]]. He is also one of the founders of the religious sect known as the [[Three Faces of War]].",
