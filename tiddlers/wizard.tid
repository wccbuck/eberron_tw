Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united
as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle
weave of [[arcane magic]] that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast
spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception,
and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures
monsters from other [[plane]]s of existence, glimpses the
future, or turns slain foes into [[zombie]]s. Their mightiest
spells change one substance into another, call meteors
down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds. 

Wizards stand apart from the legions of others who dabble in the arcane arts on the magically charged world of [[Eberron]]: They alone are willing to devote their lives to the daunting work of arcane study. Wizards are distinguished from [[sorcerer]]s and [[warlock]]s by their incredible versatilityâ€”an accomplished wizard can prepare any of a hundred different spells as the situation requires.

Wizards often record the [[spell]]s they know and other arcane minutia in their [[spellbook]]s. Many wizards in the world of [[Eberron]] require access to their spellbook in order to cast their spells; however, player characters are remarkable, and this restriction is not enforced during normal play (except in special cases, such as the [[Ritual Casting]] [[talent]].)
