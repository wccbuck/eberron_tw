While commanding a brigade
of House [[Deneith]] [[blademarks|Blademarks Guild]] on a [[Cyran|Cyre]] contract
in 994 YK, Sigor led a small reconnaissance team
across the [[Cyre River]] into [[Karrnath]] shortly before
dawn on the Day of [[Mourning]]—and thus was spared
the fate of the rest of the brigade, which was instantly
obliterated.

Sigor has become obsessed with finding out what
caused the Day of Mourning. An influential heir to
House [[Deneith]], Sigor has the resources to indulge
this obsession, and he frequently leads forays into
the [[Mournland]] to search for clues. He is increasingly involved with House [[Thuranni]], hoping that the shadowmarked house might know something about
the Day of Mourning that it hasn’t revealed.
