        "text": "The elite Flayer Guard serve Lord [[Xorchylic]] and keep the peace in [[Graywall]], but they stand ever ready to face a challenge from [[Breland]]—or to launch an attack\nagainst the eastern kingdoms. The majority of the\nguards are [[orc]]s and [[minotaur]]s, along with a few skullcrusher [[ogre]]s and war [[troll]]s of [[Maenya's Fist]]. \n\nThe Flayer Guard has a number of special units. [[Jalira Stormtongue]] commands a squad of [[gargoyle]]s and [[harpy]] archers who serve as scouts and air support. [[Salan]] commands a squad of ten small [[wererat]]s; they appear as [[goblin]]s when not in rat or hybrid form. The true core of the Flayer Guard is the team\nof twenty war [[troll]]s, a unit trained by [[Sora Maenya]]. These fearsome soldiers are under the command of [[Korgel Blackblade]], a war [[troll]] of terrifying skill and\npower, who wields a magic greatsword forged by [[Szalas Jal]].\n\nEach member of the Flayer Guard is utterly devoted to the group’s [[illithid|mind flayer]] [[master|Xorchylic]], due equally to patriotism and psychic conditioning. They are veteran\nsoldiers and use intelligent tactics in combat; players expecting [[ogre]]s to be bumbling buffoons are in for an unpleasant surprise.",
