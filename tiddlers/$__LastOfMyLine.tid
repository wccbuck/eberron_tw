''Prerequisite:'' [[Kalashtar (talent)]]

Originally, there were sixty-seven [[kalashtar]]
lines, each bound to and supporting a different [[quori]] spirit. The [[Dreaming Dark]] has
long targeted my line, and assassins killed my parents. In my dreams, my spirit has told
me that I’m its last tie to the world. Perhaps
I should remain hidden away, but I believe
there’s a reason my line has been targeted
so relentlessly—a reason the [[Dreaming Dark]]
fears my spirit, a destiny only I can fulfill.

//How were my parents killed? What [[quori]] is my lineage attached to and how does it impact my personality?//

''GM Notes: ''What kind of [[quori]] spirit is the character attached
to, and why is the [[Dreaming Dark]] so determined
to destroy it? It likely makes sense for the character to use a false name, so as not to advertise their role as the last anchor for the spirit—rather than going by Aidaveth, they might call themselves Aidashtai, or even just Aida. If their true nature is revealed, they will be targeted by the [[Dreaming Dark]]—but perhaps there is something
they can do to help protect their spirit!
