The priesthood of the [[Sovereign Host]] does not have a
single leader or group of leaders. It has no equivalent to the [[Silver Flame]]'s [[Council of Cardinals]] or [[Keeper of the Flame]]. Instead, the priesthood is guided by a number of separate local liturgical councils.

The precise means by which each council chooses its membership varies from region to region. But whatever the case, each of these councils represents
the greatest and most faithful priests in a given area. The
regions overseen by the councils vary in size: the [[Host of Khorvaire]] oversees [[Passage]] and a large portion of [[Aundair]]; the [[Devout of the Celestial Crown]] manages only a
large portion of the city of [[Sharn]].

Councils wield substantial political and social power,
which they use to enforce decisions and edicts that might
otherwise go unheeded. They can threaten delinquent
priests with ostracism, removal of their congregation,
loss of status, and the like. On the other hand, they offer
mediation of disputes, spiritual and even financial aid,
further training and education, hand-picked acolytes, and
political connections to secular government. This matters
little in border towns, but in the major cities of [[Khorvaire]],
a priest of the [[Sovereign Host]] benefits greatly from maintaining good standing with the local council.

Liturgical councils might also sponsor groups of adventurers as patrons. The nature of work carried out by these groups varies; some examples can be found in the table below.

| !<<dr d6>> |!Service |
| 1 |''Smite Evil.'' You battle evil in your order's name. |
| 2 |''Fight for Freedom.'' You protect the downtrodden from the forces of oppression. |
| 3 |''Retrieval.'' Your group seeks sacred relics and holy artifacts on behalf of your church. |
| 4 |''Root Out Corruption.'' You are charged with finding corruption within the hierarchy of your own faith. |
| 5 |''Exhortation.'' You work with the faithful at a grassroots level to get them to uphold their high ideals. |
| 6 |''Dirty Work.'' As the radical zealots of your order, you sin so the other members of the order don't have to. |
