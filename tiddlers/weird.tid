Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within 120 feet must resist your magic or else become consumed by fear for up to one minute. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. Each target suffers extreme psychic damage continuously until the spell ends or it is able to shake off the illusion.
