Reina Doiran owns Cloud Antiquities ([[Little Xen'drik]] market, [[Seventh Tower]], [[Sharn]]). Flamboyant and eccentric, she judges items quickly based on her own aesthetic sense rather than their historic value, and pays more for items that intrigue and appeal to her (particularly [[giant]] artifacts) than for dusty trinkets of more scholarly worth. Reina's twin sister, Fista, owns the nearby [[Doiran Gallery]].
