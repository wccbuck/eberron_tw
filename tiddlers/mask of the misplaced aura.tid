title: mask of the misplaced aura
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The mask of the misplaced aura creates a false identity for its wearer that can stand up to virtually any form of magical scrutiny. When such a mask is created, it is invested with a specific persona, including physical appearance, personality, and ideals. When any form of [[divination]] is used on the wearer ([[epic-tier|spell tier]] or lower), it instead reads this false persona. This includes spells such as [[zone of truth]], which would ordinarily alert the caster if the target resisted the spell's effects. The spells [[true seeing]] and [[discern shapechanger]] reveal the physical appearance of the //false// persona, even if the wearer has shapeshifted into a different form.
