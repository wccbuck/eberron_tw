You magically twist space around another creature you can see within 90 feet. An unwilling creature can attempt to resist this spell. You teleport the effected target to an unoccupied space that you can see within 90 feet of you. The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze.
