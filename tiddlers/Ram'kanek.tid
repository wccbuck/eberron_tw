Ram'kanek is the ancient name of a great [[titan]] city from the [[Age of Giants]] located in the [[Fangs of Argarak]] in central [[Xen'drik]]. After the rise of the [[Cul'sir Dominion]] in the north, the Fire Prince [[Adaxus]] conquered the city of Ram'kanek and made it the seat of his new nation, the [[Sulat League]], which would stand against the might of the Cul'sir. 

After Adaxus was defeated and bound, the city was no longer considered the Sulat capital, but it was still the center of the League's industry and production. Deep mines that extended into [[Khyber]] itself extracted rare ores and [[dragonshard]]s, which were processed in elemental forges which imbued these materials with [[planar|plane]] energies or prepared them or [[elemental binding]]. The natural lava flows of the mountains were harnessed to power the massive engines of these foundries and other public works. In addition, the Sulat [[magebreeders|magebreeding]] of Ram'kanek created massive livestock and warbeasts using [[externalist magic|Externalist Theory]].

The Shattering of [[Xen'drik]] destroyed most of the city's infrastructure. Today, the ruins of Ram'kanek serve as a base of operations of the [[Battalion of the Basalt Towers]], the group of [[fire giant]]s who are attempting to unlock the secrets of [[Adaxus]]'s [[fiend]]ish power.
