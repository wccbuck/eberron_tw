Scrimshaw "the Ivory Gargoyle" is a loathsome bone-white [[gargoyle]] who kills for pleasure. The gargoyle rarely speaks but enjoys cackling at his enemies' pain. He wears a necklace of polished finger bones grimly harvested from his victims. He was captured by [[Viktor Saint-Demain]] one year ago as the gargoyle went on a two-week killing spree in the [[Cogs]], and is currently imprisoned in the [[King's Citadel]] [[Sharn]] headquarters in [[Ambassador Towers]]. 

The stony serial killer's rocky hide turned white and flaky years ago as he succumbed to a bizarre interplanar disease. The painful affliction also causes his stone-like hide to flake, leaving a trail of white dust and chips; Saint-Demain was able to use this to track down the [[gargoyle]].
