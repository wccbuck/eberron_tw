!! WIP Notes

Runnelberry season: harvest time is coming in the freshwater marshes west of Starilaskur. But a massive burrowing creature is in the area, preventing anyone from getting close.

When arriving in the Runnels to investigate, describe the [[storm spire]]s which [[Lyrandar]] uses to control the weather.

It turns out the creature is a rare jungle [[ankheg]] (creature tier 3).

Major characters:

* ''Elisia d'Vadalis'': agent of [[Balinor's Blessed]]. She is a skilled beast handler and representative of House [[Vadalis]]. She is determined to capture the ankheg unharmed and bring it to Myrifen Ranch, a Vadalis [[enclave]] nearby. But it's a wily and dangerous beast, and she needs help. She uses [[darts of tracking]].
** At some point, Elisia mentions to Arien that ankhegs are used by the Gaa'ran [[orc]]s of the [[Barrens|Droaam]], who let the creatures roam through their fields. They till the soil, form tunnels that provide passages for water, and add nutrients to the soil. She says this to emphasize that even a "monstrosity" can serve a purpose.
* ''Sedric'': local farmer. His lands are among those being ravaged by the [[ankheg]]. He wants the creature dealt with swiftly, and he wants restitution for his losses. To that end, he demands the creature be killed and that whatever rare parts or materials that can be harvested from the beast be turned over to him, to be sold.
* ''Nuala'': reclusive herbalist. This person lives in the nearby woods and has a deep understanding of creatures and their behaviors. Nuala speculates that the jungle ankheg traveled north from the [[Khraal]] rainforest in [[Darguun]]. She possesses valuable knowledge and might aid Arien in finding a way to pacify the creature without harming it. Possibilities:
** She might have special sedative herbs or concoctions that can be used to incapacitate the ankheg.
** Create a diversion into some kind of enclosure. The diversion could be meat, or the mating call of a male (female ankhegs kill the male and lay eggs in his body after mating).
** Elisia might be able to help pacify it with her [[Mark of Handling]].

Maybe Arien begins the investigation, meets with Sedric, even encounters the ankheg perhaps, before Elisia arrives and provides a twist.
