Stavros d'Medani was the baron of House [[Medani]] five hundred years ago. Unlike many in house leadership over the centuries, Stavros was never a member of the [[Warning Guild]], having lost the use of his legs as a child. Despite this, Stavros was a great tactician and led the [[dragonmarked house]] quite capably.
