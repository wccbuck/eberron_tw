Scattered around the city of [[Stormreach]] are twelve stone rings, each
radiating an aura of [[illusion]] magic. About once a month, a [[programmed image|programmed illusion]] appears at night in the center of one of the circles. Sometimes the image is lovely, and sometimes a long-dead [[giant]] appears,
whose name and history are no longer known. Other
times these illusions are disturbing, showing images
that people believe to be forewarnings or showing
places deep in [[Xen'drik]]â€™s jungles that are believed to
have been outposts of the giants or their enemies.
