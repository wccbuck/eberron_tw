Much of the common traditions of education in Galifar are the direct result of Marala's efforts, leading the people to call her the \"Hand of [[Aureon]]\". \n\nIn addition to her public works, Queen Marala took great pride in her personal library. She collected tomes from across [[Eberron]], and was known to possess rare texts and [[spellshard]]s from [[Aerenal]], [[Ohr Kaluun]], and even a massive codex written by a [[Cul'sir]] [[wizard]] of [[ancient|Age of Giants]] [[Xen'drik]]. The tales say that her library was hidden in an invisible tower. She died under mysterious circumstances, and her trove of texts wasn't accounted for in her will; it's quite possible that her extradimensional invisible tower is still out there in the ether, waiting to be found.
