The [[elves|elf]] who can turn leaf and tree\ninto arms and armor are known as woodshapers, and\nTanar Mendyrian is one of the finest in [[Khorvaire]]. While he is\nbest known for his darkwood bows, Tanar also produces leafweave, darkleaf, and bronzewood armor,\nand he takes commissions to shape melee weapons\nfrom the exotic woods. While most of his goods\nare of masterwork quality, Tanar can also magically enhance his weapons and armor. However, he takes great pride in these\ntreasures and is careful about his clientele; anyone\nthat wants an enchanted item must win Tanar's\nrespect (elves have an [[advantage]] on the attempt) before the woodshaper accepts\nthe commission.
