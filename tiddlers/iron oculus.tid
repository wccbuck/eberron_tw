title: iron oculus
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This hollow iron sphere is inscribed with an eye-like iris, and a brass hinge and clasp allow it to open. You can hold the open oculus to your eye and speak its command word. Your eye is drawn into the sphere, leaving an empty socket. While your eye is trapped and you are holding the oculus, you have [[darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet, and can detect [[polymorph]]ed and [[shapechanged|shapechanger]] creatures and objects within 120 feet. While you are holding the oculus, you can return your eye to its socket at any time.
