Drow, also called dark elves, have skin that resembles charcoal or obsidian, as well as stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most [[elves|elf]].

Long ago on the continent of [[Xen'drik]], the first drow
fought beside the [[giant]]s against the other elves. Tens
of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other
elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The [[Undying Court]] and the patron ancestors of
the [[Tairnadal]] remember the drow, but they have little
occasion to teach their living descendants about these
shadows of the distant past. 

When the elves fled to [[Aerenal]], the drow remained on
Xen'drik as subjects of the [[giant]]s, and they were caught
in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger
on Xen'drik and have set their own course, free of the
giants' malevolent influence.

Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called [[Vulkoor]]. They hunt [[giant]]s and other dangers in their lands. Led by
powerful druids and wizards, the [[Sulatar]] cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the [[Age of Giants]]. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across
[[Xen'drik]], and believe that they are destined to cleanse
the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the [[Umbragen]]
are descended from drow who fled into the depths of
the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the [[daelkyr]] and the other [[aberration]]s of the underworld. Smaller tribes, such as the [[Qaltiar]] and the [[Hantar'kul]], also exist, but they are considered part of (or offshoots of) one of the above three.

When creating a drow character, think about how you came to [[Khorvaire]]. Are you a [[Vulkoor]]i hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an [[Umbragen]] seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a [[Sulatar]] pursuing a personal path to glory?

How do you react to meeting members of other elven
cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors
described in your people's legends, or you might have an
almost instinctive reaction of distrust. You might have
overcome your initial prejudices by the time the campaign begins, or perhaps you're working to build trust
with another elf member of your adventuring party. 

!! Urban Drow

A few dozen drow can be found scattered around [[Stormreach]]. Some serve as wilderness guides or find other ways to make an honest living.
However, many turn to violence or a life in the shadows, dying in alleys or on the sand of the [[Red Ring]]. The majority of urban drow are exiles from [[Vulkoor]]i tribes, driven out for terrible crimes or breaking taboos. However, in the harsh world of the drow, mercy
is considered a crime, and drow who don’t subscribe
to their race’s ruthless ways come to the city to escape
the cruel life of the wilds.

Most of the drow within the city are settlers from
scattered tribes. Old feuds remain strong even when
the tribe has been left behind, and urban drow rarely
seek the company of others of their kind unless they
come from the same tribe. Some have found love
within the city, whether temporary or long-term, and a
handful of half-drow make their homes in [[Stormreach]]
as well.
