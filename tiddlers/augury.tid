title: augury
tooltip: 1-minute ritual, receive an omen about the results for a specific course of action
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you perform a 1-minute ritual and receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:

* ''Weal'', for good results
* ''Woe'', for bad results
* Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
* Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad

The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times within 24 hours, there is an increasing chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading (<<dr 1d4>>, where 1=Weal, etc). The GM makes this roll in secret.

!! Augury in the Five Nations

In [[Khorvaire]], oracles are a type of [[magewright]] that can be found in any major city. Every oracle has a preferred method of divination. Some use cards, others use bones or dice. But the spell //augury// is the bread and butter of the oracle. Most oracles can use augury to make predictions stretching further into the future than the spell normally allows (such as a day, or a week), but they may be limited in the subjects they can predictâ€”some oracles only make predictions related to agriculture, while others discuss romance.
