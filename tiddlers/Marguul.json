They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the\nGhaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains\nhad best travel with a Marguul guide.\n\nThe Marguul keep members of\nother races (including [[goblin]]s and [[hobgoblin]]s) as\nslaves, and only [[bugbear]]s can be full members of a\nMarguul tribe.\n\nDespite their xenophobia, some of the Marguul tribes pay homage to the Lhesh [[Haruuc|Haruuc Shaarat'kor]] and the [[Ghaal'dar]]. However, the exceptions can prove\ndangerous to travelers. The Kalkor are a Marguul\ntribe whose members worship the [[Mockery]], and who\ndelight in flaying their enemies alive. A veteran warrior named Morgaath rules the Kalkor, frequently\nleading hunting expeditions against outsiders who\ndare to venture into the [[Seawall Mountains]].",
