        "text": "This [[Carrion Tribe|Carrion Tribes]] reveres an imprisoned [[overlord]] of filth and pestilence known as [[Ashurak]], the Slow Death. Its members seek to turn the power of their lord against their enemies. Plaguebearers smear their weapons with filth; a victim struck with a coated weapon may be subjected to fever-inducing contagion. Plaguebearers are typically covered with weeping open sores and angry welts from various infections, but they are remarkably resistant to the effects of diseases and poisons. \n\nIn battle, the Plaguebearers become wild berserkers;\nthey close ranks as quickly as possible and fight to the\ndeath, praying that infection will claim the lives of any\nenemies who survive the battle. [[Fulgrun Bloodboil]], a hideous individual surrounded by a horrible stench of pus and rot, leads the clan. \n\nThe Plaguebearers are mostly found in the [[Demon Wastes]], but they have occasionally started small cults in the [[Five Nations]]. While it might seem that these cultists would find allies among the [[Children of Winter]], the truth is quite the opposite; the maladies of [[Ashurak]] are deeply unnatural, and the [[druid]]s battle these cults whenever they find them.
