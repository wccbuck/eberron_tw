Born to one of the old families of [[Sylbaran]], Dosun Oars embraced the teachings of the [[Wardens of the Wood]] and proved himself to be a capable [[ranger]]. Today he commands the Warden garrison of [[Sylbaran]] and oversees the training of Warden recruits. While generally a kind man, he is relentless when dealing with criminals or raiders that threaten Sylbaran. Dosun plays [[hrazhak]] with the Graykin (local [[shifter]] community), and is one of the few humans to play on a shifter squad.
