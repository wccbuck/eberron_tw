Lamias are rare and solitary [[monstrosities|monstrosity]] native to [[Droaam]]. A typical lamia is about eight feet long and weighs between 400 and 600 pounds. Like a [[centaur]], a lamia has a humanoid upper body which merges into a muscular four-legged form. The upper body is typically feminine in appearance, regardless of the lamia's sex; the lower body has lion-like clawed forefeet and hoofed hindfeet, and is covered with snake-like scales (though some varieties have shark-like skin). 

A lamia possesses innate skill with [[illusion]] and [[enchantment]], and typically has abilities akin to the spells [[disguise self]] ([[humanoid]] forms only), [[lesser|lesser illusion]]/[[greater illusion]], [[charm]], [[suggestion]], and [[mirror image]]. Some lamias can also innately [[scry|scrying]] or cast more powerful enchantments such as [[geas]]. They also have the ability to curse a creature they touch with a magical intoxication that weakens the target's ability to discern illusions or resist enchantments; this curse typically lasts for up to one hour.

Bestiaries of the [[Five Nations]] describe lamias as "tyrants of pleasure," ruling over beguiled slaves in crumbling ruins adorned with stolen finery and illusory embellishments; they go on to say that lamias are "particularly fond of seeking out those with pure hearts to seduce and corrupt to evil, savoring the destruction of their virtue." However, this account is likely based on an encounter with one particular lamia [[chib of the Barrens|Culture of Droaam]]; as each creature is a unique individual, scholars of these creatures should take this description with a grain of salt.
