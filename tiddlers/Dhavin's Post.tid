//On the [[Blackwater River]]’s shore, a village comes into view. The squat buildings look foul; the wood from which they were built is pitch black. The thatching is moist and slimy, running down the walls from some of the huts. A long, wooden bridge connects both river shores—the construction hops from one small island to the next. It looks much like the buildings: blackened, rickety, and haphazard.//

Dhavin's Post is a town in the [[Shadow Marches]], the largest town in the [[Vile Marsh]]. Half of Dhavin’s Post is built on solid ground, while the other stands on stakes in the swampy areas on the shore of the [[Blackwater River]]. The inhabitants simply call the Blackwater “the river” or “the riv’;” they don’t have any specific name for it. The small town also features many house boats. For food, the populace hunts for fish and even [[sahuagin]] and other large aquatic creatures using iron traps, or hunts for other meats in the swampy, lightly wooded mangrove forest. A few vegetables grow in the shallow waters.

Curiously, the town is overrun by "swamp ravens." They
perch on houses, caw at the inhabitants, and tilt their heads
ominously. Swamp ravens are larger than regular ravens, and
they have a flashy green hue to their feathers. Since the ravens
are extremely intelligent, the populace has trouble catching
them for food. It is also considered bad luck to hunt or kill
the ravens—which is justified, because they hold a grudge and
avenge their brethren when the opportunity arises.

!! Religion in Dhavin's Post

A majority of the populace of the town prays to an [[aboleth]] they call the Lurker. It resides in a partially flooded cave network below the settlement. The Post’s inhabitants neither know that it is an aboleth, nor would they know what an
aboleth is—and if they did, they wouldn’t care. Therefore, none
of the townsfolk hide their veneration for the Lurker. They
have small shrines in their houses, mostly crooked boards,
where they burn dried herbs and present small offerings.
