        "text": "Owned and operated by [[Deneith]]'s [[Blademarks Guild]], this business hires out mercenaries who specialize in air combat, and is located two levels beneath the [[Lyrandar Tower]] docking port. Under normal circumstances, a group of 10 Blademarks can be hired with as little as one day's notice. Each mercenary wields a [[skystaff]] or some other [[magic item]] which grants the power of flight.\n\nThe walls in the Hall of Steel and Clouds are painted blood crimson, and its rooms and hallways are decorated with statues of armored soldiersâ€”some of which\nare winged. Paintings depicting weapons, [[airship]]s, and\narmed battles hang on the walls. But creature comforts,\nsuch as plush chairs and couches, are notably missing\nfrom most of the complex. Such fripperies can be found only in the reception area, where ''Captain Larinard'', the leader of the company, greets clients and conducts negotiations.",
