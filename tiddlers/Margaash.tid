Margaash is the war leader of the [[Darguun]] mercenary troop known as the [[Va'khor]], and can often be found at their base of operations at the [[Bloodstone Inn]] in [[Malleon's Gate]], [[Sharn]]. He is not a merchant, and he generally relies on House [[Deneith]] to negotiate contracts on his behalf. However, for the right price, he may be willing to provide information or even a [[goblin]] guide to help a party traveling to [[Darguun]]. Margaash only respects strength; fighters get better results than [[wizard]]s.
