Although its members aren't prohibited from studying any form of magic, the specialties of the order\nare [[abjuration]], [[divination]], and [[evocation]] magic. [[Wizards|wizard]]\nand [[artificer]]s are almost always welcome in the guild. \n[[Sorcerers|sorcerer]] must prove their grasp of [[arcane theory]] to\nearn a place, and [[warlock]]s are rarely accepted as members. \n\nIn [[Sharn]], the hall of the Esoteric Order of Aureon is in the\ndistrict of [[Clifftop]] in [[Upper Dura]]. The Order's tower\nis built of white marble, and glamers have been\nwoven into the stone that cause the tower to shimmer\nand glow so that it seems as if it has been crafted of\nsolid light. The [[Mystic Market]] surrounds the tower.",
