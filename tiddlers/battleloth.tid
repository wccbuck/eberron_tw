Other [[yugoloth]]s of [[Mabar]] may serve their masters as mercenaries, bodyguards, and torturers, but the battleloths literally serve as tools for
their masters to exploit. Each of these
creatures can take the form of a particular weapon, such as a sword, axe, or
crossbow, and can be wielded in combat. When taking this form, such a weapon's effective [[rarity]] is typically "very rare".

Battleloths are wily, cunning creatures
whose allegiance may be purchased by
the highest bidder at any time. Now and
then a wielder comes to regret striking a
bargain with a battleloth when opponents
on the field bid higher for the creatureâ€™s
services in the midst of a fight. See [[Immeasurable Market]] for some ideas of unconventional currencies a battleloth may demand.
