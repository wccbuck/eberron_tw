tooltip: archer who draws on the divine power of the Silver Flame
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Archery is a devotional practice of the [[Silver Flame]], and many faithful practice on the range daily,
regardless of their station on the battlefield. The
people of [[Thrane]] take pride in their archery, and
peasant archers played a major role in the [[Last War]]. While such informal vigilante militias are
surprisingly effective, the Church of the Silver
Flame also fielded elite units of exceptional
archers behind their frontlines. These archers
were the envy of every other major power and
the magical capabilities they could deliver with
a volley of arrows far exceeded that of any other
nation. As much of [[Thrane]]â€™s conflict during the
war was with the neighboring [[Karrnath]], the
training of the silverbows focused on infusing
their arrows with the power of the Flame itself,
blasting their [[undead]] foes with radiant energy or
using beguiling arrows to control the battlefield
or halt a fight all together.
