Doras was once the reeve of Cytal, a tiny village in the south of [[Cyre]]. He was visiting a cousin in [[Smoky Towers]] on the Day of [[Mourning]]. Bitter and short-tempered, Doras's demeanor permanently changed after his homeland was destroyed. Today he makes public speeches in Smoky Towers and [[High Walls]], urging people with Cyran blood to come to the aid of their ancestral homeland. The [[Guardians of the Gate]] and the [[Citadel|King's Citadel]] both keep a close watch on Doras, but he has yet to be arrested.
