Doras is a village reeve from [[Cyre]] who was visiting a cousin in [[Smoky Towers]] on the Day of [[Mourning]]. Today he remains in Smoky Towers as an insurgent, urging people with Cyran blood to come to the aid of their ancestral homeland. The [[Guardians of the Gate]] and the [[Citadel|King's Citadel]] both keep a close watch on Doras, but he has yet to be arrested.
