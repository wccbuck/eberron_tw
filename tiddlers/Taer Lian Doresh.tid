Taer Lian Doresh, "the Fortress of Fading Dreams", is a [[feyspire]] no longer connected to the [[Moonlit Vale]] of [[Thelanis]].

Long ago, the tyrant titan [[Cul'sir]] cursed the feyspire and cast it into [[Dal Quor]], after an ongoing revenge feud following the sacking of [[Shae Tirias Tolai]]. Caught in the transformation of the //Quor Tarai//, these [[eladrin]] became embodiments of classic nightmares, and ease their pain by spreading fear among mortals. The spire itself is a vision from nightmare, and no two people perceive it in the same way.

Taer Lian Doresh now exists between [[Dal Quor]] and the
Material Plane, hidden deep in the [[Whitepine Forest]] in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. The [[eladrin]] of this feyspire can freely pass to both [[plane]]s, but other creatures can only enter Taer Lian Doresh and return to their plane of origin; they can't use it as a portal to
the other plane. Thus, [[quori]] and adventurers can walk the halls
of the Fading Dream together, but the quori can't cross over
to physically enter [[Eberron]] itself, nor can the denizens of the
Material Plane (including eladrin of other feyspires, humans,
and all other creatures of Eberron) enter Dal Quor.

!! Organization

The [[fey]] of the Fading Dream are led by an [[eladrin]] named ''Shan Lian Doresh''. This brooding king rarely leaves his [[feyspire]], watching the
world through the dreams of innocents and destroying lives with whispered secrets and terrible visions.

Seven Knights of Terror serve Shan Lian Doresh, each of which embodies
a particular primal fear. The shrouded sages, led by the [[night hag]] ''Santyriana'', are mystics and dream weavers.
