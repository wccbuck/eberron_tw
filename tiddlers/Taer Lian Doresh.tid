type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Taer Lian Doresh, "the Fortress of Fading Dreams," is a [[feyspire]] no longer connected to the [[Moonlit Vale]] of [[Thelanis]]. Once known as Shae Doresh, the Spire of Dreams, this spire and its lords swore revenge against the [[titan]]s after the destruction of [[Shae Tirias Tolai]]. Over the course of a thousand years, they transformed their city into a mighty fortress, crafting arms, armor, and powerful spells of battle. When the [[feyspire]] next appeared in [[Eberron]], they challenged the emperor of the [[giant]]sâ€”but woefully underestimated his power. 

The tyrant [[titan]] [[Cul'sir]] cursed the feyspire and cast it into [[Dal Quor]] with a powerful ritual. It remained trapped in the Region of Dreams for millennia until it was caught in the transformation of the //Quor Tarai//, when the [[plane]] partially ejected the spire into the Material Plane. After its long sojourn in Dal Quor, the feyspire had transformed into a vision from nightmare, which no two people perceive in the same way. Now called Taer Lian Doresh, the Fortress of Fading Dreams, the spire is populated by spiteful [[eladrin]] who have become embodiments of classic nightmares, and ease their pain by spreading fear among mortals. The Fey of the Fading Dream hunt and kill all who stray too close to their citadel. They despise other [[eladrin]] for being weak, and consider the [[elves|elf]] to be a debased mockery better wiped away.

Taer Lian Doresh now exists between [[Dal Quor]] and the
Material Plane, hidden deep in the [[Whitepine Forest]] in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. The [[eladrin]] of this feyspire can freely pass to both [[plane]]s, but other creatures can only enter Taer Lian Doresh and return to their plane of origin; they can't use it as a portal to the other plane. Thus, [[quori]] and adventurers can walk the halls of the Fading Dream together, but the quori can't cross over to physically enter [[Eberron]] itself, nor can the denizens of the
Material Plane (including eladrin of other feyspires, humans,
and all other creatures of Eberron) enter Dal Quor.

!! Organization

The [[fey]] of the Fading Dream are led by an [[eladrin]] known only as ''Shan Lian Doresh''. This brooding king rarely leaves his [[feyspire]], watching the world through the dreams of innocents and destroying lives with whispered secrets and terrible visions.

Seven "Knights of Terror" serve Shan Lian Doresh, each of which embodies a particular primal fear. The "shrouded sages," led by the [[night hag]] [[Santyriana]], are mystics and dream weavers.
