type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[High Hope]] contains an unusual
shrine to Boldrei, a monument that has come to be
known as Daca's Watch. A thick, 12-foot pillar of
[[densewood]], this structure was supposed to hold a statue
of some priest or martyr, but funding for the project
evaporated, and the pillar stood empty for many years.
One day, a [[gnome]] named [[Daca]] climbed up to the top
and sat down. From this high perch, she watched and
studied the people, occasionally shouting advice to
people who seemed troubled or distressed.

That was 120 years ago. Daca still sits on her
post, watching over her neighbors. While she has no
oracular powers, she is very familiar with the people
of High Hope and has a great deal of common sense.
The inhabitants of the district often come to her
for advice or when a mediator is required, and she served as an emotional pillar of the community over
the course of the [[Last War]].

While she has no religious training and does
not profess to be a priestess of [[Boldrei]], most of the
locals believe that she has been touched by the goddess and consider her to be a holy woman. They are
not alone in this; a handful of priests from other
districts regularly visit High Hope to discuss events
in [[Sharn]] with Daca.
