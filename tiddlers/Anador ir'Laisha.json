        "text": "The [[Thrane]] ambassador to [[Sharn]], Lady Anador ir'Laisha monitors events in the city on behalf of her nation from the [[Thrane Embassy|Thrane Embassy (Sharn)]], but rarely becomes actively involved in local affairs. She is devoted to the [[Silver Flame]] and attends services at the [[Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame]]. Blinded by her faith, Lady\nir’Laisha trusts the Archierophant implicitly and angrily dismisses any suggestions that [[Ythana Morr]] might be using the power of the Church for her own benefit. Lady ir’Laisha’s devotion to the church is greater then loyalty to her country, and she may be manipulated into unknowingly assisting Ythana with a nefarious scheme.",
