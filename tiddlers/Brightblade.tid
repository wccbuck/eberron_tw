''Date: '' [[12 Nymm|Khorvaire calendar]]

Brightblade, the holy day of [[Dol Dorn]], the [[Sovereign|Sovereign Host]] Lord of Strength
and Steel, sees festivals occur in all of the temple districts of the city of [[Sharn]]. Prizefights, wrestling matches, archery contests, and jousts occur throughout the day, culminating in a contest of champions at the [[Cornerstone]] arena in [[Middle Tavick's Landing]]. The champions receive generous prizes, and a fortune can be made gambling on the contests.

Occasionally, even more fantastic conflicts have been staged on Brightbladeâ€”full-scale battles held on the training grounds of [[Daggerwatch]], free-for-all melees with hundreds of contestants, and similar spectacles.
