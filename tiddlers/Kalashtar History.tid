title: Kalashtar History
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The [[kalashtar]] race has existed for only eighteen hundred
years. It began in [[Dal Quor]], where [[Taratai]] and her followers of light were being hunted down and exterminated by the [[Dreaming Dark]]. Taratai led her followers
on an exodus through mortal dreams. While the quori
could not travel physically between the planes, Taratai
believed that she had found a way to cross through the
subconscious and into mortal bodies—provided that
the proper portals could be found and that the hosts
could be convinced to accept the travelers.

For one year, they traveled from dream to dream, passing
through the dreams of [[dragon]]s and [[beast]]s, never finding a place to rest. The [[Dreaming Dark]] was still baying at their heels, and between the Dark and the dangers of
the dreams themselves, Taratai’s followers were slowly
being destroyed. Finally, Taratai found the passage she
needed—a subconscious conduit into the mind of an
[[Adar]]an monk named Hazgaal. She knew that she couldn’t maintain the
connection for long, but she pleaded her case to the master
of the monastery—and to her surprise, he agreed to accept
her band of fugitive spirits. [[Adar]] was the land of refuge,
he said, and no creature would be turned away.

Sixty-seven people—including the master himself—volunteered to share their bodies with the renegade [[quori]]. In order to establish a permanent bond
and truly escape from [[Dal Quor]], it was necessary for the
quori to merge fully with their hosts, creating a synthesis
of both personalities. These were the first of what [[Taratai]]
called the [[kalashtar]], a word in the [[Quor]] language that
roughly translates as “wandering dreams.”

It took time for the [[kalashtar]] to adapt to their new
existence, but they were finally free from the [[Dreaming Dark]]. [[Taratai]] continued her studies of the nature of [[Dal Quor]] and the Dream of the Age, and she developed
the traditions that are the core of the [[Path of Light]]—a series of practices and devotions that she believed would accelerate the turn of the age. There was only one uncertainty: What would happen when one of the [[kalashtar]] died?

Before they found the answer to this question, another
mystery was revealed: that of birth. When the first
[[kalashtar]] child was born, they found that the spirit that was tied to the parent now also had a bond to the child.
The spirit, Harath, found that it took more of an effort
to communicate with either of his hosts, but that he
was nonetheless aware of the experiences of each. Over
the next few centuries, the process continued.

As more and more [[kalashtar]] were born, the [[quori]]
spirits were spread thinly among them, and it became
almost impossible for the spirit to communicate directly
with the kalashtar. The memories and basic personality
were still there, however; even if they couldn’t communicate, the spirits were still alive and conscious, experiencing the world through the eyes of hundreds
of descendants.

Each generation was more physically distinctive than the last, and each lived longer than the one before; it was clear that the spiritual symbiosis induced physical changes as well. As they slowly adapted to better suit their spiritual companions, the [[kalashtar]] began to
develop [[psionic|psionics]] abilities. The kalashtar did not have access to the full power of their ancestors, but they still had astonishing abilities. They could fly, send messages from one mind to another, transform their bodies into living weapons. It was a time of wonders.

It would not last. Three hundred years had passed in the world, but three thousand years had passed for the agents of the [[Dreaming Dark]]. They had spent millennia studying [[Taratai]]’s flight, and they had found a way to improve upon it. Traveling the fringes, they could whisper into dreaming minds, implanting ideas and suggestions into people’s heads. After a century of this manipulation, they managed to throw the nations of [[Sarlona]] into chaos (see the [[Sundering]] page). In the process, they arranged for specific people to meet, for bloodlines to be formed, and ultimately created humanoid [[hosts|Chosen]] that the [[quori]] could possess and control—without any degree of cooperation from the subject.

Another three centuries passed, and a wave of charismatic young lords appeared among the war-torn realms of [[Sarlona]]. This new generation of rulers claimed to
be divinely inspired, and they had the supernatural
powers to prove it. After a few more centuries, this alliance had “restored peace” to the shattered land—failing to mention that they’d been responsible for the war,
centuries ago. They established the nation of [[Riedra]], home to millions of people who were fanatically devoted to the new [[Inspired]] overlords.

The young [[kalashtar]] paid little attention to the events
in [[Riedra]], concentrating on their [[Path of Light]]—until
the first army of the [[Inspired]] laid siege to [[Kasshta Keep]]. The [[kalashtar]] had been lucky to find [[Adar]]; the natural defenses of the mountainous land were almost
impregnable. The Inspired had the resources of an
entire continent at their disposal, however, and were
growing more powerful every day.

More than a thousand years later, the stalemate still stands. The [[kalashtar]] continue their devotion to the [[Path of Light]], but many believe that the Inspired have come up with a counter to [[Taratai]]’s plans. The [[Inspired]] have created a stagnant society in [[Riedra]], and they are spreading their enormous [[monoliths|hanbalani alta]] across the land. Many kalashtar believe that the Inspired plan to spread these monoliths across the entire world—and that if enough of them are built, it will finally secure the safety of the [[Dreaming Dark]].

The [[kalashtar]] don’t intend to let that happen.

And so the struggle begins anew...

!! Adventure Hook: Lost Souls

Many of [[Taratai]]’s followers were lost in the exodus from [[Dal Quor]]. Some were destroyed, but others were simply... lost. Many [[kalashtar]] [[psion]]s believe that more
rebel quori are still out there in the fringes of the [[Ocean of Dreams]], trapped in the minds of bizarre and ancient creatures. Can they be freed?

A [[kalashtar]] sage summons the party with an unusual proposition. He
believes that he has located the soul of one of the rebel [[quori]] trapped in the dreams of Golorach, an ancient [[silver dragon]]. The sage has prepared a potion that should send the imbibers’ spirits into Golorach’s dreams the next
time they fall asleep. Will they be able to find the lost soul? And what strange dangers lie in wait in the mind of the dreaming dragon?
