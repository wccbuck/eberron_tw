        "text": "The Dreambreaker was a [[gnome]] born in what’s now [[Zilargo]]. His [[aberrant dragonmark]] allowed him to shatter the minds of people around him, and some accounts suggest that he could twist time and space. However, his power also affected his own perception of reality. It’s said that he believed that [[Halas Tarkanan]] and his retinue were actually fighting the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]], and that the [[dragonmarked house]]s and their mortal minions were simply manifestations of this greater cosmic struggle. He was devoted to the aberrant cause and his sheer power was a vital weapon in their arsenal, but his instability prevented him from leading forces on his own. Like the [[Lady of the Plague]], the Dreambreaker was often featured in anti-aberrant propaganda; [[Sivis]] spread wild tales of his abilities to crush minds and claimed that he could murder innocent people in their dreams.\n\nThe Dreambreaker is presumed to have died in the siege of [[Sharn]] at the end of the [[War of the Mark]], but he was fighting in a different tower than [[Halas Tarkanan]], and some accounts suggest that he planned to twist time, stealing the future from the houses… but nothing was ever heard from him following the destruction of Sharn.",
