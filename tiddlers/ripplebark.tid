Ripplebark is a hardy subterranean fungus that grows in the tunnels of [[Khyber]] in shelf-like formations. The fungus is edible, and has a nutty flavor. It also has mild antiseptic properties.

Ripplebark (or "suur") was a staple of the diet of the [[Heirs of Dhakaan]], usually prepared in the form of starchy balls.
