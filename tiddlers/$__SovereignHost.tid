The [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]] once fought [[fiend]]s in the [[first age of the world|Age of Demons]]—and they’re doing it again. I’m a mortal host of a Sovereign spirit. Their power is within me, the source of my powers and abilities. They guide me through visions and dreams, revealing my purpose piece by piece. I need to be careful who I reveal this to, as the [[fiend]]s would surely kill me if they could. But I know that I am a Sovereign incarnate.

//Which Sovereign am I tied to? Do I revel in this or consider it a burden?//

''GM Notes: ''The character believes that they are the vessel for
one of the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]]. This doesn’t grant them
greater power than other party members, since
//all// player characters are remarkable. However,
if the vessel is a [[rogue]], they know it’s [[Olladra]]
granting them expertise. If they’re a [[paladin]],
they’re assured it’s [[Dol Arrah]]’s power that flows
through their smite. It’s up to you how often the
character receives divine visions or directives;
these could be frequent and specific, or rare and
vague. The ultimate question is what’s actually
going on. Is the character truly a vessel for a
Sovereign? Is it some sort of trick? Or are they
the vessel of an ancient champion who indeed
battled [[fiend]]s in the [[Age of Demons]], someone
who inspired the legends of the Sovereigns—but
who was merely mortal?
