        "text": "The Briar Hills are a region of rugged hills and gorges in southeast [[Breland]]. These gorges by rivers such as the [[White River]] flowing northeast from their sources in the [[Howling Peaks]]. The land often suddenly shears away into steep cliffs, revealing stunning vistas of the terrain below and the distant horizon. \n\nSeveral abandoned quarries of rusty sandstone are scattered around the landscape, particularly near the [[White River]]; the scars of excavation are softened by time and weather. The stone here was used to build [[Harken Keep]] and other structures throughout [[Harkenwold]].\n\nThe vegetation here is sparse. Resilient grasses cling to the rocky soil, providing sustenance to wandering herds of grazing antelope. Deep-green clusters of prickly shrubs are also scattered among the hills.\n\nThe Briar Hills are home to a number of nomadic tribes of [[shifter]]s known as the [[Cliffwalkers|Cliffwalker Camp]].",
