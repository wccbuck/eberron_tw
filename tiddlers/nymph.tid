Nymphs are [[fey]] of [[Thelanis]] representing nature’s imagined embodiment of physical beauty, and they guard the sacred places of the wild. They are so unbearably lovely that even a glimpse of one can blind an onlooker. A nymph’s demeanor is wild and mercurial.

Nymphs are typically bound to a specific place or type of geography, and are often divided into subgroups depending on their chosen habitat. ''Meliae'' cling to groves of trees, and often cavort with [[dryad]]s. ''Naiads'' are bound to rivers and lakes, while ''nereids'' are bound to seas. ''Oreads'' are mountain nymphs.
