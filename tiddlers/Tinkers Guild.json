Much of Cannith’s popularity among\nthose who do not have [[dragonmark]]s can be attributed to periodic visits from Cannith tinkers. House\nelders maintain that the wandering life of a tinker\nis a character-building exercise, and most of the\nimportant dragonmarked heirs spend some of their\nadolescence traveling among the tinkers.",
