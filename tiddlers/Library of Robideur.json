        "text": "Near the top of Skyreach Tower at [[Arcanix]]\nis one of [[Khorvaire]]’s finest collections of arcane\nlore. The library takes up the top four floors of Skyreach’s tallest spire, with bookshelves running from floor to ceiling. Only the doors and the stained-glass\nwindows interrupt the walls crammed with [[spellbook]]s,\ntomes, and grimoires. A unique spell not unlike [[unseen servant]] controls the books within the library. An arcanist of the [[Arcane Congress]] need only state the title and\nauthor of a book, and it slides from its shelf, opens\nwide, then slowly descends to the arcanist’s waiting\nhands, lazily flapping its cover open and shut in imitation of a bird.\n\nThe library forbids checking out books even to the most powerful members of the Arcane Congress; examination of a book at one of the library’s oak desks is the only option.\n\nThe head librarian is the [[half-elf]] [[wizard]] Tanila.",
