One of the largest [[layer]]s of [[Shavarath]], Nullius Terram is a battlefield the
size of a small nation. It's divided by several deep, heavily
fortified trenches, which are separated by blasted regions of
scorched earth, blast craters, and bones. Nullius Terram's
multiple trench lines twist and curve throughout the region,
and in the lands between the trenches lie strategic outposts.
The region is marked by constant barrages and terrible
tools of mass destruction—widescale [[cloudkill]], curses that
transform conscripts into killers, and worse.

[[Tyranny]], [[Cruelty]], and [[Justice]] are the three active [[legion|legion of Shavarath]]s in this region. Justice has a difficult position in Nullius Terram, but
has been slowly gaining strength. Periodically, the commanders
send troops to clash in the fields between the lines, either in
simple skirmishes or full offensives. Ultimately, the theme of this layer is that of slow, agonizing stalemate, and the suffering war can inflict on both the land and the soldiers.

Nullius Terram is noteworthy for its [[flowing time|Flowing Time]]; for every
10 minutes that pass in this layer, only 1 minute passes
in [[Eberron]]. So it's a long, slow struggle—you could spend
months here and only miss a week in Eberron.
