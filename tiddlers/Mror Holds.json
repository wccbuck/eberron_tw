This division kept the [[clans|Mror clan]] from uniting against\nthe new arrivals, and the dwarves were forced to swear\nfealty to [[Karrnath]] and [[Galifar]]. Over the centuries, they\nturned their energies to harnessing the astonishing\nnatural resources of their mountain home. The dwarves\nwere then reborn as merchant lords.\n\nIn the early days of the [[Last War]], Mror miners made\nan astonishing discovery: the ruins of an ancient dwarven empire, vast halls deep within the [[Ironroot Mountains]]. Explorers uncovered mines still brimming with\njewels and precious ores and vaults filled with riches\nand powerful artifacts. The Mror restored these ancient\nfortresses and worked to reclaim the secrets of their\nancestors. Seeing the untapped potential of the [[Realm Below]] and the broken Kingdom of Galifar, the clan lords\njoined together to form the [[Iron Council]] and to declare\nthe independence and sovereignty of the Mror Holds.\n\nOne question remained: What had become of the ancient [[dwarves|dwarf]]? The answer soon became apparent. As\nthe Mror delved deeper into the Realm Below, they woke\nan ancient evil: [[Dyrrn]] the Corruptor, a [[daelkyr]] lord of\nmadness. Hordes of [[aberration]]s and [[derro]] rose from the\ndepths to challenge the explorers. For decades, the Mror\nlords have been fighting a battle in the depths, struggling to drive the darkness from their ancestral halls.\nMany dwarves revile anything to do with the [[daelkyr]].\nOthers believe that the daelkyr can grant the Mror\ndwarves the power to overcome any enemy. Some clans\nhave taken up [[symbiont]]s and living weapons recovered\nfrom the depths, and cabals of [[warlock]]s draw on the\npower of the Plane of [[Xoriat]].\n\nFor more information on the history of the dwarves, see [[Mror History]].\n\nThe Mror Holds consist of a loose confederation.\nTwelve noble [[clans|Mror clan]] each govern a hold and have a\nrepresentative on the [[Iron Council]], which resolves disputes and issues affecting the entire nation. Each hold\nincludes a number of lesser clans, who owe fealty to the\nnoble line. Those who occupy land above have the right\nto claim the halls that lie below if they can.\n\nThe [[Sovereign Host]] is the dominant faith of the Mror\nHolds. [[Kol Korran]] is the most beloved of the Sovereigns, but the dwarves also revere [[Boldrei]], [[Dol Dorn]], [[Olladra]], and [[Onatar]]. \n\nSee also [[Culture of the Mror Holds]], as well as [[Mror clan]]s.\n\n!! Interesting Things About {{!!article}}{{!!title}}\n\n* The Mror Holds contain deep reserves of gold, silver, and other rare and precious metals, along with iron and other ores. The Mror [[dwarves|dwarf]] are skilled miners and artisans. \n* A clan of [[orc]]s called the [[Jhorash'tar]] live among the [[Ironroot Mountains]]. The Jhorash'tar have been slowly crowded into the least hospitable regions of the mountains. A few dwarven clans seek to incorporate the Jhorash'tar into Mror society, but others wish to drive them out once and for all. \n* The dwarves have recovered artifacts and arcane secrets from the [[Realm Below]]. Dwarf [[artificer]]s are still working to master the techniques of their ancestors, while [[warlock]]s strive to harness the powers of the [[daelkyr]]. Mror communities are shaped by the artifacts they possess or by their interactions with the daelkyr. A Mror lord might serve guests from a bottomless cauldron of wine, while another studies strangers using a [[crown of eyes|Belashyrra's beholder crown]], claiming that this living artifact reveals all evil intent. \n\n!! Mror Characters\n\nAs you develop a Mror character or NPC, consider the\nfollowing:\n\n* ''Clan Focus.'' The [[dwarf]] [[clan|Mror clan]] is the heart of Mror culture. Is your clan known for mercantile power or martial skill? Are you a noble—even if you're a few steps removed from true power? Or are you a guild artisan or soldier? Most Mror have embraced modern martial techniques, but a few minor clans still cling to barbarian traditions of the past. What caused you to leave your hold? Are you serving your clan and honing your skills, or have you been exiled from your homeland?\n* ''The Realm Below.'' How has the [[Realm Below]] affected your family and your character? Do you oppose the foul forces that infest your ancestral halls, or do you see them as a source of power? You might be a [[paladin]] sworn to oppose the horrors that dwell in the deep, or you could be a [[warlock]] who's forged a pact with a Great Old One patron, one of the dark powers in the depths.\n* ''Pride in Possessions.'' From the wealthiest clan lord to the humblest miner, the Mror take great pride in their possessions. Quality is more important than appearance, and you are interested in the history of the items you carry. If you find a magic weapon, you want to know the battles it has seen and the warriors who have wielded it before you. This is especially true of the relics recovered from the Realm Below. Who forged the blade you carry? Do you bear a trinket from a forgotten age? \n\n!! Cities and Sites\n\nThe Mror Holds spread across the [[Ironroot Mountains]].\nMost Mror communities are at least partially subterranean, extending down into the mountains. The [[Realm Below]] is deep beneath the surface, and not every town\nhas a passage to it. \n\n!!! Cities\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[location]tag[city]sort[title]]\">>\n\n!!! Towns\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[location]tag[town]sort[title]]:filter[get[text]length[]compare:integer:gt[150]]\">>\n\n!!! Other Sites\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[location]!tag[province]!tag[city]!tag[town]sort[title]]:filter[get[text]length[]compare:integer:gt[350]]\">>\n\n!! Aftermath of the Last War\n\nThe Mror Holds declared independence during the [[Last War]]. Many nations depend on the resource of the Holds, and the [[Treaty of Thronehold]] affirmed its sovereignty.\n\nTo the casual observer, the Mror [[dwarves|dwarf]]' star appears to be rising. Their mines seem to offer limitless resources. Mror [[artificer]]s make amazing strides as they study the relics of their ancestors. The dwarves are proud of their ancient past and optimistic about the future. Most Mror are generous and courageous, eager to show off their wealth and accomplishments.\n\nThose who dig deeper realize that this prosperity is\nbuilt on an unstable foundation. The Last War may be\nover, but the war against the [[daelkyr]] has barely begun.\nThe clan lords hold their reclaimed halls in the [[Realm Below]], but no one knows the full extent of the power of the daelkyr. A renewed assault could come at any time,\nwhether it's a force of monsters boiling up from below or\na creeping madness that infects the weak-willed.\n\nThe dwarves are also divided by their attitude toward\nthe [[aberration]]s. Some of the clans—notably [[Soldorak]]—embrace [[symbiont]]s and other [[daelkyr]] gifts; some even experiment with flesh-warping techniques and create\ntheir own monsters. Others—notably Clan [[Mroranon]]—avoid contact with the [[aberration]]s. Such dwarves treasure the relics of their ancestors but despise those who\nuse [[symbiont]]s or form pacts with the darkness.\n\nLong ago, the dwarves engaged in vicious feuds that\nkept them from uniting as a nation. This new divide\ncould reignite those rivalries, leading to a civil war on\nthe surface even as evil gains strength in the depths. ",
