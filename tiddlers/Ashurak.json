The plagues they spread are agonizing and disfiguring, but never kill quickly; lingering suffering is the hallmark of Ashurak. While their prison is in the [[Demon Wastes]], their influence can be carried by the diseases they create, and Plaguebearers have occasionally started cults in the [[Five Nations]]. Ashurak isnâ€™t one of the most powerful or infamous overlords, but they do have representatives among the [[Lords of Dust]]; their speaker is a fiend known as [[Shalashar]].",
