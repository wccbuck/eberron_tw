Abyssal (or "Infernal") is the [[immortal]] [[language]] of [[fiend]]s, spoken across the [[plane]]s where fiends manifest ([[Shavarath]], [[Fernia]], [[Mabar]]) as well as the depths of [[Khyber]] and the [[Carrion Tribes]] and [[rakshasa]] of the [[Demon Wastes]]. It is sometimes referred to as "the language of Khyber" or "devils' tongue".

Abyssal has influenced many of the mortal languages of Eberron, including [[Gnoll]], [[Sahuagin]], and the language of the [[Ghaash'kala]] [[orc]]s.
