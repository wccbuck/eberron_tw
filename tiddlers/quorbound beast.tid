Though the energy of the Region of Dreams pervades
[[Sarlona]], the creatures of [[Dal Quor]] cannot cross over
to the material realmâ€”their [[plane]] is forever remote.
Even so, the [[Inspired]] have devised methods to augment
[[beast]]s with a hint of [[psionics]], and these quorbound creatures serve as guard
animals, mounts, and spies. Quorbound creatures breed true, however, and those that escape captivity and mate with mundane members of their species
sometimes pass their otherworldly abilities onto their
offspring. 

Those who fear the [[Inspired]] are quick to see the taint
of evil in the quorbound. However, those aware of the
legend of the turning of the age know that the potential for good
still lingers in the dark heart of [[Dal Quor]].
