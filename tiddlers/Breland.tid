''Capital:'' [[Wroat]]<br/>
''Hallmarks:'' Espionage, industry, metalwork, organized crime, subterfuge<br/>
''Population:'' <<ntls>> (44% [[human]]s, 14% [[gnome]]s, 10% [[half-elves|half-elf]], 8% [[elves|elf]], 7% [[dwarves|dwarf]], 4% [[halfling]]s, 4% [[changeling]]s, 4% [[goblinoid]]s, 3% [[orc]]s, 2% other)

In the wake of the [[Last War]], Breland is one of the most
powerful nations in [[Khorvaire]]. Possessing a large population and abundant resources, Breland leads the continent in industry.

The Brelish are known for their pragmatism and independence. They lack the discipline of [[Karrn|Karrnath]]s and the faith of the [[Thrane]]s, but they excel at finding innovative
solutions to problems. The Brelish also have a talent
for intrigue and subterfuge. The [[King's Dark Lanterns]]
is one of the finest intelligence agencies in Khorvaire,
rivaled only by House [[Phiarlan]] and the [[Trust]] of [[Zilargo]].
The dark side of these aptitudes is a strong streak of
cynicism, which allows crime and corruption to flourish
in Brelish cities and temples. The [[Sovereign Host]] is the
dominant religion of Breland, but in general the Brelish
aren't as devout as citizens of other nations.

King [[Boranel ir'Wynarn]] rules Breland in conjunction
with an elected [[parliament|Breland Parliament]]. Boranel is a popular leader
celebrated for his exploits during the [[Last War]], but his
children have yet to prove themselves, and a growing
movement advocates for abandoning royal rule when
Boranel passes.

!! Interesting Things About {{!!title}}

* [[Sharn]] is the largest city in [[Khorvaire]]. Almost a nation in its own right, the City of Towers is a hub for commerce and intrigue.
* The [[Boromar Clan]] is the oldest and most powerful criminal organization in Breland. The Boromar [[halfling]] leadership maintains ties to the [[Talenta Plains]]. Other notable criminal organizations include the monsters of [[Daask]] and House [[Tarkanan]], an alliance of assassins and thieves with [[aberrant dragonmark]]s.
* Breland's major cities are highly cosmopolitan. Due to its proximity to [[Droaam]], Breland's cities include more monsters—[[ogre]]s, [[orc]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, and even [[sahuagin]], [[harpies|harpy]], and [[gargoyle]]s—than elsewhere in the Five Nations.

!! Brelish Characters

As you develop a Brelish character or NPC, consider the following qualities:

* ''Slightly Shady.'' Many Brelish have a loose relationship with the law. Even if you're a hero, you might have questionable connections or friends in low places. Talents such as [[Criminal]], [[Charlatan]], and [[I Know A Guy]] can reflect this tendency, regardless of your class. You could also be a [[Bodyguard]] who challenges the laws to protect the innocent, or an [[Entertainer]] who plays in every dive in [[Sharn]].
* ''Innovative and Independent.'' Find your own path in the world; don't simply follow established traditions. As a [[cleric]], you might challenge your church and follow your own divine revelations. As a [[wizard]], you could search for new techniques or attempt to unravel forgotten secrets.
* ''Practical.'' Whether it's about fashion, food, or conversation, the Brelish tend to be pragmatic. Why spend a fortune on a fancy meal when a simple one will do? You use whatever tool gets the job done, and you don't see a need for unnecessary flair.

!! Aftermath of the Last War

For Breland, the Last War was an ever-shifting tangle
of enemies and alliances. Breland fought [[Aundair]], [[Cyre]],
[[Karrnath]], and [[Thrane]] at various points of the war, as
well as clashing with [[Darguun]] and [[Droaam]]. These conflicts caused many Brelish to embrace a cynical view of
the world, a sense that no one can be fully trusted and
that people need to look out for themselves. As a Brelish
character, you could have an axe to grind against any
of the other nations. This is balanced against a strong
belief in humanoid rights and dignity, convictions that
motivated the Brelish to shelter more Cyran refugees
than any other nation.

The major cities of Breland host significant populations of refugees, both Cyrans and Brelish from villages lost in the war. This has increased the overall level of poverty and desperation and contributed to an increase in crime. The southern cities—including [[Wroat]] and [[Sharn]]—suffered relatively little damage in the war, but northern Breland was hard hit. The city of [[Vathirond]] is still repairing the damage from [[Thrane]] attacks, and many northern villages are either recovering or have simply been abandoned.

Despite these struggles, the Brelish maintain a positive view of their future. The heart of Breland is as strong as it ever was, and the citizens believe that had the war continued, Breland would have triumphed.
