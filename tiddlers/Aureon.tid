Aureon is the Sovereign of Law and Lore, the lord of all knowledge. He is considered the first [[wizard]], who shared the secrets of wizardry with the world. He has dominion over the use of magic for the greater good and for the spread of civilization. Aureon is the patron of judges and lawyers, and is invoked before most legal proceedings in [[Khorvaire]]; some courthouses even possess an [[Eye of Aureon]] to magically compel honesty in those who speak. He is also the patron of wizards and sages, and several [[arcane order]]s (such as the [[Arcane Order of Aureon]] and the [[Esoteric Order of Aureon]]) directly honor him in their oaths.

Aureon urges his followers to:

* Respect and acquire knowledge, especially knowledge that was once lost.
* Value reason and sound thought over emotion and rash action.
* Educate yourself, your children, and your allies.

According to the [[Pyrinean Creed]], Aureon is the brother of [[Onatar]] and the husband of [[Boldrei]]. The [[Shadow]] is considered to be the literal sentient shadow of Aureon, representing the darker side of magic and knowledge. While the scripture of the [[Sovereign Host]] does not place any of the deities above the others, Aureon directs the actions of the other eight—not due to any authority he wields, but because the Host trusts his wisdom and foresight.

The largest temple to [[Aureon]] in [[Khorvaire]] is known as the //Codex Vault//, located on the [[Street of a Hundred Temples]] in [[Korranberg]], [[Zilargo]].

!! Aureon in Other Traditions

The [[Restful Watch]] sect primarily honors Aureon, but believes he works with the [[Keeper]] to preserve the souls of heroes to be restored when they are most needed.

In the [[giant]] faith known as [[Rushemé]], Aureon is known as "Ourelon Lawbringer," who "gave up his shadow" in exchange for knowledge of magic and who shared that knowledge with the titans of [[Xen'drik]]. Some modern faithful claim he was consumed by his [[Shadow]], and all those who work [[arcane magic]] flirt with disaster.

In the even older tradition of [[Thir]], the [[dragon]] faith, Aureon is known as [[Ourelonastrix]], who they believe was a [[blue dragon]] champion during the [[Age of Demons]] who discovered the [[Draconic Prophecy]]. Those dragons who wish to embody the [[Sovereign archetype]] of Aureon are known as [[loredrake]]s.
