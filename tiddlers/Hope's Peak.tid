Hope's Peak is the most recent temple district constructed in [[Sharn]], and many of the shrines were
relocated from the [[lower levels|Lower Dura]] of [[Dura]]. The most
important building is the [[Citadel of the Sun]], but
the main temples of the [[Sovereign Host]] and the
[[Silver Flame]] draw worshippers from the depths
of Dura. While most of the priests of the region
are devout enough, this is Dura, and pragmatism
abounds. If a party of adventurers knows who to
talk to and how to approach them, divine miracles
can be bought outright. 

!! Noteworthy Locations

* The [[Citadel of the Sun]]. A temple devoted to [[Dol Arrah]], noteworthy for the three blessed [[griffon]]s that reside there.
* [[Olladra's Arms]]. One of the finest restaurants in [[Sharn]], with a different menu each night.
