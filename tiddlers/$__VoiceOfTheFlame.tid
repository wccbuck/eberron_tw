''Prerequisite:'' Know the [[Draconic]] language

When I was a child, a rainbow serpent appeared to me and told me that I would be a champion of the light. Throughout my life, I’ve sought to protect the innocent from danger and fight forces of unnatural evil. Now the [[couatl]] has appeared again, telling me that
my destiny approaches. I know that when it comes, it will be more than just a battle—I’ll
have to inspire people, to rally them against darkness. My magic and abilities flow
from the [[Silver Flame]].

//Am I proud of my calling or do I feel it’s a burden? Am I afraid that [[fiend]]s are hunting me?//

''GM Notes: ''[[Tira Miron]] wasn’t the first Voice of the Flame,
and she won’t be the last. Tira Miron was called
to protect [[Thrane]] and to battle [[Bel Shalor]]. This
player character should face a similarly epic challenge, but it should involve a different [[overlord]] and location. It makes sense to give this secret
to a character wielding [[divine magic]], such as a [[paladin]] or [[cleric]], and to say that
their magic comes directly from the [[Silver Flame]].
However, the character doesn’t have to be tied
to the //Church// of the Silver Flame, and they
don’t have to adhere to its exact doctrines. The
existing church is based on Tira’s teachings;
this character’s existence may ultimately birth a
unique sect of the Silver Flame.

The player should only be given this secret if
you believe that their character is indeed willing
to defend innocents from harm and to battle
darkness. But once they have the power, it’s up
to them what they do with it; after all, mortal
vessels don’t always live up to immortal ideals.
