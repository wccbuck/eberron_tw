        "text": "The dark wood on the northern shore of [[Lake Brey]] in [[Thrane]]\nis called the Harrowcrowns. At the birth of [[Galifar]],\none great forest stretched from the [[Blackcaps|Blackcap Mountains]] to\n[[Scions Sound]], including the woods now called the\n[[Greenhaunt]], the [[Imistil Forest]], and the [[Thornwood]]\nas well as the Harrowcrowns. Settlers through the ages have cleared most of the land for farming, and several small [[Thrane]] villages now surround the Harrowcrowns, despite the monsters that periodically seem to erupt from the forest and ravage the countryside for miles around.\n\nSavage [[goblin]]s raided out from the Harrowcrowns in 465 YK, leading eventually to the discovery of an ancient [[Dhakaan]]i ruin in the heart of the forest. A team of scholars from [[Flamekeep]] never returned from its exploration of the ruins, and the ruins’ location has since been lost.\n\n[[Ettercap|ettercap]]s and giant spiders, crazed [[dryad]]s and [[treant]]s, bloodthirsty [[gnoll]]s, and twisted [[dolgrim]]s are among the monsters that have emerged from the forest to ravage the surrounding villages. Some have speculated that a planar connection—to [[Thelanis]], or perhaps the mad realm of [[Xoriat]]—is responsible for the plague of monsters, but it seems more likely that these creatures are native to the forest itself.
