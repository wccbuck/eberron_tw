        "text": "The dark wood on the northern shore of [[Lake Brey]] in [[Thrane]]\nis called the Harrowcrowns. During the days of the Empire of [[Dhakaan]], one great forest stretched from the [[Blackcaps|Blackcap Mountains]] to [[Scions Sound]], including the woods now called the [[Greenhaunt]], the [[Imistil Forest]], and the [[Thornwood]]\nas well as the Harrowcrowns. Settlers through the ages have cleared most of the land for farming, and today, several small [[Thrane]] villages now surround the Harrowcrowns, despite the monstrous threats that periodically seem to erupt from the forest and ravage the countryside for miles around.\n\n[[Ettercap|ettercap]]s and giant spiders, crazed [[dryad]]s and [[treant]]s, and bloodthirsty [[firbolg]] [[barbarian]]s are among the creatures that have emerged from the forest to ravage the surrounding villages. In truth, it is the [[firbolg]]s of the Harrowcrowns behind all of these threats. They blame civilization for the destruction of the [[Forest Queen]]'s Wood, and use all weapons at their disposal to prevent its further encroachment.",
