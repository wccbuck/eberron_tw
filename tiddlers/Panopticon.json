There are chambers in which\n[[angel]]s and [[devil]]s stand around wide scrying pools, replaying\nrecent events. And in the highest chamber of the Panopticon,\ntwelve [[solar]]s—with one seat empty—contemplate the events\noccurring in the planes they are bound to and wait to be\nsummoned by the authorities of those planes.\n\nThe Panopticon is larger than the entire city of [[Sharn]].\nDifferent sections are devoted to each of the planes, and\nsome immortals have spent countless years monitoring a\nparticular location or creature. It holds the most powerful\nand sophisticated scrying network in existence, dwarfing the\ncapabilities of even the [[dragon]]s of [[Argonnessen]]. However, this\nsystem is not intended to benefit mortals. Adventurers must\nhave an exceptional reason to secure a travel pass allowing\nadmittance to the Panopticon, and the immortals who work\nthere are not inclined to answer questions.",
