Ghalt is a large town in [[Aundair]]. For centuries, the town was technically part of [[Thrane]], lying on the border between the two nations. {{!!title}} blended the customs of both nations and had inhabitants from both sides. However, during the [[Last War]], [[Aundair]] pushed back this border and maintained it with a series of fortresses, including [[Wrogar Keep]], [[Tower Valiant]], and [[Tower Vigilant]]. Today, the people of {{!!title}} are largely happy to be Aundairian, but there is a small minority who consider themselves Thranes and despise the Aundairian tyrants.

In recent years, the organization known as [[Daask]] has spread its roots to this town.
