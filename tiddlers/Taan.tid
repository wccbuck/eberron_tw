The [[Healing Hand]] maintains a large infirmary in the [[Jhodra]] of [[Dar Jin]] that provides mundane healing to those in need. In addition, the overseer Taan can perform [[psionic|psionics]] healing. He usually reserves this power for [[Riedrans]] in need, but could help foreigners who have somehow earned his respect. At the GM's discretion, Taan could be a member of the [[Unchained]].
