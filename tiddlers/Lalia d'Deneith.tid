Identical twins Lalia d'Deneith and [[Tasra d'Deneith]] are the leading [[Sentinel Marshals]] in [[Sharn]], headquartered in the [[Three Towers]] [[enclave]]. They can be inconsistent about which fugitives they chase down, leaving some high-profile but potentially longterm pursuits to other marshals. Nonetheless, they
are a fugitiveâ€™s worst nightmare: implacable, but likely to toy with their quarry before ending the chase. Lalia specializes in tracking fugitives through the wilderness.

Unknown to all but agents of the [[Dreaming Dark]], both sisters are hosts to [[tsucora]] [[quori]] spirits.
