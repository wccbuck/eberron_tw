        "text": "The Heavenly Fleet is the smallest of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], though it is growing—in defiance of all predictions. Led by the winged Prince [[Lorrister]], the Heavenly Fleet is dedicated to bringing justice to the [[Lhazaar Sea]] and the rule of law to all its settlements. The [[paladin]] prince holds his crews to high ideals and hopes to impose those same ideals on the people of the Principalities. Currently, the Fleet consists of only three ships, and they primarily target lone pirates near their home port on [[Seventh]] island rather than antagonizing larger forces such as the mighty [[Cloudreavers]].\n\nEven though the Lhazaarites greet [[Lorrister]]’s principles with scorn, people outside the Principalities who share his philosophy are attracted to his cause, and Lorrister\nclaims a large number of foreign supporters and suppliers. This influx of aid from such places as [[Thrane]], the Martial Temple of [[Dol Arrah]] in [[Starilaskur]], and numerous private benefactors translates into the finest gear and supplies for the Heavenly Fleet's ships and crews.",
