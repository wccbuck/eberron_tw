title: writ of enforcement
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A writ of enforcement is a document provided by an official in law enforcement or city government which authorizes the bearer to conduct official duties of the city watch under the authority of the official granting the writ. For example, members of the [[Sharn Watch]] with a rank of sergeant or higher can grant a writ of enforcement to adventurers or other freelancers. City workers and other members of the Watch respect the writ, sometimes grudgingly, as long as the bearer doesn't engage in flagrantly illegal activity.
