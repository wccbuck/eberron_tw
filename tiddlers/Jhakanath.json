A powerful [[telepath|psion]], he recognizes that sometimes persuasion is more powerful than [[psionic|psionics]] domination.\n\nThe ambassador has provided King [[Sebastes|Sebastes ir'Kesslan]] with a garrison of troops to help defend his young nation, and a [[Riedra]]n quarter has sprung up in the city of [[Newthrone]]. Jhakanath is purchasing large quantities of [[dragonshard]]s from House [[Tharashk]], but the [[Inspired]] have also secured permission to start their own mining operations. Nonetheless, the richest shard deposits lie in the lands of the [[scales]], and Sebastes wonâ€™t let the Riedrans threaten his relationship with the [[lizardfolk]] or [[dragonborn]]... yet.",
