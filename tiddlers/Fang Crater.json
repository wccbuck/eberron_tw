The stone rim is blackened and smooth, and volcanic gases rise from cracks and vents in the walls. The crater was caused by a planar incursion from [[Fernia]], when forces from the [[Sea of Fire]] flooded into [[Argonnessen]]. The [[Light of Siberys]] repelled the assault, and the [[loredrake]]s sealed the rift. Still, a [[manifest zone]] to Fernia remains at the very center of the crater\u2014a pit of lava more than a mile wide.\n\nAn ancient, ruined [[planar observatory]] called the Orrery of Vortuum is set into the rim of the crater.", "modified": "20210727192007875", "tags": "[[manifest zone]] dungeon Argonnessen Vast geography", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "article": "the ", "category": "location", "color": "#3B5C0A", "polygons": "-0.914,100.36 -1.449,100.96 -1.394,101.85 -1.311,102.89 -0.72,103.53 -0.138,104.29 0.655,104.34 1.431,103.82 1.828,102.98 2.031,101.76 1.708,100.84 1.015,100.15 -0.028,99.94", "style": "{\"color\":\"#482714\",\"fillColor\":\"#482714\",\"fillOpacity\":\"0.7\"}"}
