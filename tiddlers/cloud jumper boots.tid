title: cloud jumper boots
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While wearing these boots, you can jump while in the air as if you'd leapt from solid ground. When you make a mid-air jump, faint clouds fly out from under your feet. The boots allow you to jump in this way only one time before they make contact with a solid surface again.
