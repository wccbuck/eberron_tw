Chunks of embedded\nglowing green [[crysteel]] give the impression of gleaming\neyes gazing out across the foreign quarter. While the Eyes\nhave hundreds of hidden agents, the streets of the [[Jhodra]]\nare patrolled by overt guardians dressed in distinctive\ngreen-and-black uniforms. Any [[Riedran|Riedrans]] can come to\nthe tower to report criminal or suspicious activities, and\nthe [[Thousand Eyes]] will either respond alone or bring in\n[[bastion guard|Bastion Guard]]s to deal with the problem.\n\nThe commanding officer of the Jhodra Thousand Eyes is Lady Malesha ([[usvapna]] [[Inspired]] telepath), who personally handles interrogation of prisoners.\nOther important figures are Lord Tulkath ([[hashalaq]] [[Inspired]] kineticist), who can use [[trace teleport]] and [[dimensional anchor]] to help apprehend criminals,\nand Lady Dardhuna ([[hashalaq]] [[Inspired]] seer), a specialist in psionic [[scrying]].
