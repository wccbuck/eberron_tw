title: booming blade
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This spell is cast by [[swordmage|eldritch knight]]s just before striking an enemy. Their blade becomes sheathed in booming energy, and when they strike an opponent with it, a peal of thunder echoes from the point of contact, and the target suffers vibrational [[force damage|damage type]]. If the target moves over the next few seconds while the echoes are still rippling, they may suffer additional damage.
