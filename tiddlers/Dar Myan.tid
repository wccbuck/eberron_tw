Dar Myan is a bastion in [[Ghirvagura]]. Built on the
floodplain of the [[Koralanda River]], it is a center of distribution and agriculture, as well as the home of important
[[Inspired]]. It has training facilities for both the [[Dreaming Dark]] and the [[Thousand Eyes]]. A major military installation also calls Dar Myan home, providing training
for soldiers of the [[Savage Legion|Taskaan Legion]] and other military
branches. The [[monoliths|hanbalani alta]] of Dar Myan play an important
role in powering the bastion and could be a target of any
anti-Inspired operation inside the city.

Dar Myan is shaped like a bulbous cloverleaf and riddled
with channels and canals. A fortress for the [[Inspired]],
surrounded by wide waterways crossed only by drawbridges, occupies the center of the city.

Lord [[Baalnakosh]] of the [[Bountiful Horn]] ([[hashalaq]] [[Inspired]] [[psion]]) rules Dar Myan and oversees its important functions. He is
aided by hundreds of [[Chosen]] and served by thousands
of servants, agents, and troops.

This city's description can be used as a template for other [[Riedra]]n bastion cities.

!! Notable Features

!!! Wall and Gate

Dar Myan's wall is about 80 feet
thick. The sides and top are honeycombed with military
posts, storage facilities, and barracks. Bulges in the wall
form larger command posts and troop rallying points.
The command posts, set every 500 feet in the wall, are
the only places where the wall can be entered at ground
level inside Dar Myan.

Dar Myan's gates are immense, swiveling slabs of
stone and [[sentira]] that can be closed and locked by the
effort of a few soldiers using the machinery within the
towers flanking the gateway.

!!! Gate Monolith

At the gate, this imposing edifice stands as a tribute to the might of the [[Inspired]] and the industriousness of Dar Myan's people. The [[monolith|hanbalani alta]]
here powers nothing—it is held in reserve to defend the
eastern walls of the bastion.

!!! Trades District

In this district of the bastion, people
practice crafts to supply their fellow citizens, as well as
[[Riedra]]'s military and nobility, with needed finished
goods. Priests of the [[Path of Inspiration]] live among and
guide the common folk. Raw materials are barged in from
the river to the channel here and unloaded at warehouses.
No barge traffic passes the first bridge on the channel.
Excess production is shipped out the same way.

!!! People's Monolith

In the center of the trades district stands the People's Monolith. This [[hanbalan|hanbalani alta]] powers the conveniences of city life and is a broadcast center for the [[Soothing Voice]] in the eastern reaches of the city. The people of the trades district are allowed to come here for spiritual inspiration, and all of them
gather here for the annual Feast of Founding, during which the monolith is disconnected from the power grid and used to gather energy for the city's [[Inspired]] overseers. Similar monoliths exist in the city's other districts.
Each has a raised platform, a spacious hall underneath
for public functions and meals, and pools of purified
water churned by small fountains. These pools also serve
as public wells, though some areas of the trades district
actually have running water.

!!! Military District

Across the channel from the
trades district is a military district where soldiers train
and live. The common folk who provide the military's
mundane needs also work and dwell there. Bridges into
this district are heavily guarded and regularly patrolled.
Only those who have proper identification and essential
business enter this zone. Across the channel from where
barges unload in the trades district is a similar facility
for military supply and troop deployment. Comparable
sections of the city near the central fortress provide shelter for lesser nobility, centers of learning, and training
grounds for the elite agents of the [[Thousand Eyes]] and the
[[Dreaming Dark]], although few beyond the [[Inspired]] know
the true nature of the Dreaming Dark facility.

!!! Honor's Monolith

Honor's Monolith is a power
center for the military district and a center for spirituality among the soldiery. Soldiers gather here for
speeches from their Inspired leaders and to march
with pride and respect to the People's Monolith. Furthermore, the open area around the monolith is used
for special training and troop inspection. The pools
here serve the same function as those near the People's
Monolith, but one can serve secondarily as a facility for
training in aquatic combat.

!!! Fortress Palace

The central fortress of Dar Myan
houses the living quarters of Lord [[Baalnakosh]] and his
staff. Within the compound are facilities for all the
needs of the [[Inspired]] ruler, as well as a [[monolith|hanbalani alta]] for his
personal use. Baalnakosh's palace is kept comfortable
throughout the year by the power of the monolith, but the
[[hashalaq]] sometimes uses the hanbalan for other purposes.
The wall around the fortress has two gates—east into the
military district and north into the [[Chosen]] district.

!! Notable People

The people of Dar Myan are normal [[Riedrans]] for the
most part, but some stand out.

* [[Naldhuna]]
* [[Orakhun]]
* [[Jhaasha]]
* [[Clade]]

!! Encounters

Response to intrusion is fast and brutal. At the first sign
of trouble, military forces mobilize and the citizens lock
down their quarters and workshops. But the city's roads and alleys are easy to hide in, and the troops tend to go to
obvious trouble spots (such as a nonfunctioning [[monolith|hanbalani alta]]). Dar Myan's people are likely to fear anyone brave
and capable enough to take out a monolith, but they are
unwilling to aid intruders.

Stealth, speed, and evasion are the best approaches.
Hiding within the city is a possibility, but when the situation calms after a raid, [[Baalnakosh]] has his troops do a
systematic search of the bastion.

Within Dar Myan, intruders may encounter [[Bastion Guard]]s, eventually gaining the attention of specialist squads of [[psi warrior]]s or [[psion]]s (always [[Chosen]] or [[Inspired]], usually [[tsoreva]] or [[tsucora]]). A standing force of [[Taskaan|Taskaan Legion]] [[shifter]]s is also available. Finally, a troop of soldiers of the [[Sleeping Sword]] is largely made up of [[Chosen]] and [[Inspired]] [[psi warrior]]s and
[[soul knives|soulknife]]. Such units are usually led by a [[tsucora dreamblade|tsucora]].

!! Development

The channels and canals of Dar Myan are its weak
points—the arrogance of the [[Inspired]] is another. A
clever assault squad could breach the bastion at the river
and come in by way of the channel. Then it's a matter
of assaulting the proper points in the city to complete a
mission's objective.

Curfew occurs at two hours after sundown every
day. Lights are shut down then, and any person caught
on the streets is subject to arrest and punishment. Even
so, illicit activities do take place in the dark of Dar
Myan's nights.
