title: Gimblette's amulet of bug blasting
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This small green stone amulet hangs on a silver chain. The faint scent of eucalyptus emanates from the smooth gem.

Mundane, non-dire insects and arachnids cannot get within five feet of the wearer. If a bug does happen to get past the barrier, it explodes loudly and violently.
