The Cinder\nSisters prowl this wasteland and vie for the boiled blood\nof anyone foolish enough to trespass. The heads of this\n[[fiend]]-touched [[hydra]] bicker constantly, although whether\nthey possess individual intelligence or the demonic\nmonstrosity is merely mad, no one knows. A few junior\nmembers of the [[Lords of the Hunt]] of [[Stormreach]] have succeeded\nin bringing back one or more of the Sistersâ€™ heads,\nclaiming to have slain the beast, but the veterans in the\norganization know this is foolish presumption.",
