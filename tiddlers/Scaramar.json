        "text": "High-priced and extremely efficient, Scaramar is [[Stormreach]]’s premier hired blade and poisoner. The assassin is never seen with the same identity twice, and his elderly [[gnome]] servant is his only confidant and companion. The few people who even know he exists assume that Scaramar is a [[changeling]]. In truth, Scaramar is the elderly servant, and the other “assassins” are cat’s-paws the gnome uses, murders, and discards like garbage. Scaramar recruits up-and-coming killers with the same line every time: “I’m getting old, and I want to pass on my skills to a suitable protégé. Let me teach you all there is to know about assassination.”\n\nScaramar trains his minions for a short time\nbefore sending them on their first mission. The\ngnome accompanies his protégé on the job to ensure\nthat all goes smoothly. When the target is eliminated,\nthe gnome murders his unwitting accomplice and\nsearches for another. Scaramar has carefully plied\nhis trade for years since his forced exile from [[Zilargo]].\nStill, one of his protégés might escape him and seek\nthe party’s help. Scaramar has a thousand enemies\nwho want him dead. If the PCs can expose him or,\nbetter yet, kill the old gnome themselves, they can earn\nrewards from the many in [[Stormreach]] who have lost\nrelatives and partners to the assassin.",
