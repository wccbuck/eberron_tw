Daan is the language spoken by the [[immortal]]s and [[manifestation]]s of [[Daanvi]], the Perfect Order. Despite the fact that the rules of the language are well-formed and without exception, Daan is difficult for mortals to learn. Words are formed from stringing together successive morphemes and syllables to specify meaning, leading to sentences that are extremely long by mortal standards; denizens of [[Daanvi]] tend to speak very rapidly (yet precisely and without error).
