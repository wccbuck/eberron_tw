Their [[kraken]]-marked [[galleon|elemental galleon]]s harness air and water [[elemental]]s and are faster than any mundane vessel. Control of sea and river trade gave Lyrandar considerable power. Now they reach out to the skies. Merely a decade old, Lyrandar [[airship]]s have undermined the [[lightning rail]]'s domination of overland travel.\n\nHouse Lyrandar also controls the air in a literal way. The [[Raincallers Guild]] can use the [[Mark of Storm]] to [[control the weather|control weather]] for its clients.\n\nFor many of the house's members, the house is more than a family or business—its private island [[enclave]], [[Stormhome]], is the closest thing they have to a homeland. Baron [[Esravash|Esravash d'Lyrandar]] is ambitious and often steers the house to act in what he sees as the interests of all [[half-elves|half-elf]]. Lyrandar heirs help the [[Valenar]] [[elves|elf]] run their young kingdom, and some believe that Valenar could\nbecome a true homeland for the [[Khoravar|half-elf]]. \n\n!! History of House {{!!title}}\n\nAccording to House Lyrandar lore, the\n[[Mark of Storm]] first appeared more than\n2,000 years ago on two [[half-elves|half-elf]], Lyran and Selavash, who saw visions of [[Arawai]] and [[Kol Korran]] promising that the half-elves would become masters\nof both nature and commerce. The duo traveled\nacross [[Khorvaire]], encouraging half-elves to divorce\nthemselves from both [[human]] and [[elven|elf]] society.\nOver time, the children of Selavash and Lyran—the\n//Lyran’dar//—became a [[dragonmarked house]].\n\n!!! The Last War\n\nIn the early stages of the [[Last War]], House Lyrandar was less involved than other [[dragonmarked house]]s, since its elemental [[airship]]s hadn’t yet been invented and the [[Five Nations]] had little need for sea transport. But as the war ground on, various\ngovernments approached House Lyrandar about using\nweather control to gain an advantage on the battlefield\nor to augment farm production at home. House Lyrandar agreed, but limited its manipulation to improving the weather. For the right price, House Lyrandar would provide plentiful spring rainfall or an early thaw in the mountains, but refused to cause a drought or bog down an army in mud or snow. Nations and [[dragonmarked house]]s paid well for such services.\n\n!! Guilds and Organizations\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}tag[trade guild]sort[title]]\">>\n\n!!
