[[Fernia]]n ashes are a potent component
of [[magic item]]s tied to the [[evocation]] school. In addition, if a
spellcaster discards a pinch of Fernian ashes while casting a
fire [[spell]], that spell is magnified.

Fernian ashes are created from the wood of rare trees found
only in the [[Sea of Fire]].
