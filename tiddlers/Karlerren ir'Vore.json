        "text": "Colonel Karlerren ir'Vore is the commander of the famed [[Von Harrla's Regiment]] mercenary organization; most soldiers in the Regiment refer to him simply as \"the Colonel\". The second son of a prominent noble family in [[Karrnath]], Karlerren served in the Karrnathi army until 973 YK, when his men deserted him in the face of a unit of [[Cyran|Cyre]] [[warforged]] soldiers. Surrounded by more than a hundred enemies, ir'Vore held them off with a clever bluff until the Gauntlets of Von Harrla arrived and rescued him. He joined the regiment on the spot, and worked his way up the ranks over the next two decades.\n\nThe Colonel is in his sixties and is contemplating retirement. When he does, [[Von Harrla's Regiment]] will have to promote a new colonel, likely causing a power struggle among high-ranking leaders.",
