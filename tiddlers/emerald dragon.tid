type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Emerald dragons are the most curious, cunning, and manipulative of the [[gem dragon]]s, wielding [[psionic power|psionics]] to weave illusions to deceive and
disorient. They cloak their own presence so they can observe other creatures without being discovered as they collect information on everything from
local cultural practices to supernatural occurrences.

A wyrmling emerald dragon’s scales are a dull, pale green, but they develop into richer and more varied shades of green as the dragon ages.
Eventually, the scales become translucent and shimmer in the light, rippling as the dragon moves. The dragon’s horns and spines hover above the
body, moving and shifting along the back and tail to mirror the dragon’s mood.

!! Magic and Breath Weapon

The emerald dragon can exhale a wave of psychic dissonance, causing psychic damage and disorientation to any creature caught in the cone. In addition, adult emerald dragons can manifest [[psionic powers|psionics]] such as [[detect thoughts]], [[dispel magic]], [[etherealness]], [[far step]], [[greater illusion]], [[immolation]] (green fire), and [[mislead]].

Emerald dragons can also cast [[clairvoyance]] at will as long as they have access to a large flame or pool of lava as the focus for that spell.
