''Population:'' <<ntls>>

The largest city in [[Darguun]] serves as the seat of Lhesh [[Haruuc Shaarat'kor]]. As the hub for trade, travel, and diplomacy, it also provides a haven for fugitives and smugglers.

The heart of Rhukaan Draal was once a frontier [[Cyran|Cyre]] market town called Almstede; over the last two decades, it has grown into a sprawling [[goblinoid]]
metropolis. Rough yet functional [[Ghaal'dar]] architecture
creates a city of patchwork styles and materials. The most
impressive structure is the royal palace; dissatisfied with
the work of his kindred, the Lhesh [[Haruuc|Haruuc Shaarat'kor]] hired the stonemasons of House [[Cannith]] to build his home and fortress, called //Khaar Mbar’ost//, or Red House (literally, “blood-colored fortified dwelling”). This ten-story tower of red granite dominates the skyline of Rhukaan Draal. Virtually all the [[hobgoblin]] clans have representatives at Haruuc’s court, though the [[Dhakaani clans|Heirs of Dhakaan]] maintain a particularly low profile; their agents monitor events for their lords but try not to attract attention to the activities of their clans.

House [[Deneith]] occupies
a large [[enclave]] in Rhukaan Draal, as well as maintaining the nearby [[Gathering Stone]]—a fortress that serves as a staging area for goblins interested in selling their
services to the house. House [[Tharashk]] has also established an outpost here, but their racial heritage works against them; throughout the history
of [[Dhakaan]], [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s were mortal enemies,
and the [[Darguuls|Darguun]] still harbor strong prejudices
against orcs and their kin.
