''Population:'' <<ntls>>

[[Riedra]] built its empire on the foundation of a dozen shattered nations following a period known as the [[Sundering]]. Scholars consider the loss of these nations to be a tragedy... except for Ohr Kaluun. The lords of this ancient kingdom were driven by deep paranoia and an all-consuming thirst for power. The sages of Ohr Kaluun studied the darkest paths of magic and bargained with [[fiend]]s and other foul creatures. They warped their bodies through mystical rituals and pacts, creating the first [[skulk]]s and [[tiefling]] bloodlines, and perhaps even the first [[changeling]]s. Ohr Kaluun was ultimately consumed by the feuds of its paranoid mage-lords and the crusading legions of its neighbors, fueled by the dream manipulation of the [[quori]]. Today, it is a shunned region, haunted and cursed. Dark secrets and great treasures remain in the vast war labyrinths of Ohr Kaluun, but [[fiend]]s, [[ward|abjuration]]s, and far deadlier threats linger in this fallen kingdom. 

The [[Inspired]] wield considerable influence on Ohr Kel, the largest island of the chain; Dar Kel is the sole bastion city in Ohr Kaluun, serving both as a port and an outpost for the [[Harmonious Shield]] to reduce the activities of smugglers and those who would trespass in the ancient ruins. Many of the sparsely-populated smaller islands are uncivilized by the standards of the Inspired. These places are home to smugglers, monsters, and the dissident group known as the [[Heirs of Ohr Kaluun]]. Adventurers seeking to enter Riedra by stealth might be able to find assistance at a smuggler's port. However, the Riedran military is always hunting for these criminals, and safe havens frequently move about.

!! The Old Kingdom

The kingdom of Ohr Kaluun may be the most infamous nation in the history of Eberron. Its lords were ruthless in their pursuit of supernatural power, committing countless atrocities in their quest for mystical might. The influence of [[Xoriat]], [[Mabar]], and [[Kythri]] can be felt across the islands, and these powers shaped the psyche of the people. Mabar wiped away empathy, driving people to be cruel and predatory. Kythri drove constant change, a quest for innovation and endless emerging factions. And Xoriat inspired the Kaluunites to pursue strange and terrible visions, to attempt things no mundane mind would consider.

The people of Ohr Kaluun possessed advanced forms of both [[divine|divine magic]] and [[arcane magic]]. Thanks to the influence of [[Kythri]], they made countless breakthroughs in arcane science but would rarely maintain or preserve these techniques; thus Kaluunite [[wizard]]s wielded astonishing powers but rarely passed their knowledge on to future generations. The most widespread and consistent advancements in Ohr Kaluun were made by their [[warlock]]s and [[cleric]]s; the lords of Ohr Kaluun were more than willing to make dangerous bargains in exchange for the power that they craved. 

Throughout most of its history, Ohr Kaluun was ruled by an alliance of Shadow Lords. In theory these were hereditary bloodlines, but in practice the title was held by whoever could claim power and hold on to it, and feuds and uprisings were common. Ohr Kaluun is well known for its war mazes, vast labyrinths that served as both fortresses and cities. Each Shadow Lord dwelled at the heart of a great maze, pursuing their own paths to power and scheming against their rivals. Each lord generally followed a different path to power, and a maze would be devoted to a particular sinister patron, whether that was a member of the [[Dark Six]], and [[overlord]], or an arch[[fiend]] from one of the [[plane]]s such as a [[Dark Power]]. While there were a few Kaluunite lords known to have actually been loved by their people, the influences of [[Mabar]] and [[Xoriat]] drove the Kaluunites to horrific excess and cruelty. If you are ever looking for an image of a classically evil cult, for people willfully embracing the service of [[fiend]]s or performing vile sacrifices, there are surely tales of Ohr Kaluun that serve that need. 

The influence of [[Kythri]], [[Xoriat]], and [[Mabar]] permeate the islands, even beyond [[manifest zone]]s and [[wild zone]]s. There are also lesser manifest zones tied to other [[plane]]s. Every war maze was built within a particular zone, and that colored the practices and achievements of the inhabitants. Evidence suggests that both the [[skulk]]s and the [[changeling]]s were created in Ohr Kaluun, using [[magebreeding]] techniques that surely drew on the power of [[Kythri]]. The influence of [[Xoriat]] led them to pursue paths of magic no rational mind would conceive of. The priests of Ohr Kaluun revered the [[Dark Six]], but different mazes had their own unique pairings, names, and interpretations of the Six.  

Because of this chaotic history, almost any mystical approach could be found in a Kaluunite war maze. There could even have been a Shadow Lord who bargained with [[Belashyrra]] and wielded [[symbiont]]s. [[Necromancy|necromancy]] wasn't a widespread practice in Ohr Kaluun, but adventurers could be drawn into a war maze whose lord dealt with the [[Bone King]] of [[Mabar]], and whose [[mummy]] still rules over the deadly tomb. 

!!! The Fall of Ohr Kaluun

The people of [[Sarlona]] always feared and hated Ohr Kaluun. [[Pyrine]], [[Nulakesh]], and [[Khalesh]] had clashed with the islands in the past. Fear of Ohr Kaluun was a common thread the [[quori]] used in stirring up conflict across Sarlona during the [[Sundering]]; on the islands themselves, it was easy to amplifying the existing paranoia and feuds of the Shadow Lords until it reached a breaking point. The Shadow Lords crippled one another long before they were destroyed by the combined forces of [[Nulakesh]] and [[Corvagura]], united by their [[Inspired]] champions. 

Refugees from Ohr Kaluun are believed to be the ancestors of the [[human]]s and [[tiefling]]s found in the [[Carrion Tribes]] of the [[Demon Wastes]]. There is only one place where the traditions of Ohr Kaluun survive: the [[Venomous Demesne]] of [[Droaam]]. The ruling families of the Demesne are [[tiefling]]s, the result of [[magebreeding]] and pacts made by their ancestors. They possess the strongest [[warlock]] tradition in Eberron and have built upon the achievements of the past; however, long removed from the corrupting influences of [[Mabar]] and [[Xoriat]], they are neither as cruel nor as inventive as their ancestors.
