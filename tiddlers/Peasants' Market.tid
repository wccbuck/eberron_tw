type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Despite its name, the peasants’ market in [[Taer Valaestas]] is a good source of quality wares from [[Aerenal]] and across [[Khorvaire]]. The market is so named because of the fact that few [[Valenar]] [[elves|elf]] can be bothered to undertake tasks as mundane as shopping, entrusting such jobs to the [[Cyran|Cyre]] peasants and laborers who take responsibility for the elves’ land.
