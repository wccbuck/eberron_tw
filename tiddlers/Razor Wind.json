These [[barbarian]]s are one of the deadliest forces in the [[Demon Wastes]], and, in the past, the tribe’s small numbers have kept them from posing a\nsignificant threat to the [[Ghaash'kala]] [[orc]]s who guard\nthe gates of the [[Labyrinth]]. Now it seems that this has\nbeen a ruse—that the Razor Wind tribe has intentionally spread itself thin across the Wastes, and that it is pulling a great host together in the south. The\nbarbarians have excavated one of [[Rak Tulkhesh]]’s\nsoul-shards and are carrying it with them; this object enhances their primal powers and enables them to\nmanifest [[demon]]s to aid them in battle.",
