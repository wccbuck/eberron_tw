        "text": "The Barren Sea lies to the west of [[Khorvaire]], northwest of [[Xen'drik]]\nand east of [[Sarlona]]. It encompasses warm, tropical waters and cold\nexpanses in the north. It flows into the [[Sea of Lost Souls]] to the south\nand the [[White Sea]] to the northwest. [[Zarash Bay]] and [[Crescent Bay]] in the\n[[Shadow Marches]] are part of the same body of water, as is the [[Phoenix Basin]] off the coast of Xen'drik. [[Varuz Bay]] in Sarlona marks its western edge. \n\nThe Barren Sea is so called because it is poor for fishing and devoid of apparent\nlife. The waters of the Barren Sea have almost ten times the salt content of the other seas of Eberron; few plants or animals can survive in these waters. (Strangely, this charged salinity fades when the waters of the Barren Sea flow beyond its boundaries.) Hideous monsters are said to inhabit its depths—but sailors make that claim about all ten seas. In fact, sailors have more to fear from storms, icebergs in the north, and unpredictable winds than they do from any living thing in the Barren Sea. In addition to the mundane\nrisks of weather, the Barren Sea is known for scattered areas of dead calm—areas of perfectly still water, sometimes suffused with negative energy that dims light and saps life. These are believed to be [[manifest zone]]s to [[Mabar]]. \n\nAnd perhaps most strangely, a majority of the 9-million-square-mile sea is completely shielded from [[divination]]. A massive [[nondetection]] effect blankets the barren waters and anything upon them. Sages can’t explore the Barren Sea with [[scrying]], [[Tharashk]] prospectors can’t sense what lies beneath the waves, and even [[commune]] can’t unlock the secrets of the Barren Sea. Mystical navigation tools become unreliable in these waters, and navigators must be prepared to use mundane techniques.\n\n!! On The Surface\n\nThere is a regular stream of ship traffic across the Barren Sea. In the south, merchants and cargo ships travel between [[Dar Jin]], [[Dar Qat]], [[Stormreach]], and [[Sharn]]. A northern route connects [[Dar Jin]] and [[Dar Kel]] to [[Aundair]] and ports further east. The majority of these ships are [[Riedra]]n, though [[Lyrandar]] and other vessels are mixed in. Diplomats and scholars can also be found making their way across the sea. Riedran frigates of the [[Harmonious Sail]] patrol the trade routes, ever watchful for pirates and smugglers. While Riedran soldiers aren’t inherently hostile to the people of [[Khorvaire]], they may stop and board any vessel they suspect of smuggling or of supporting the enemies of Riedra—notably, the [[kalashtar]].\n\nOver the centuries, sailors have charted safe paths through the Barren Sea, identifying deadly [[manifest zone]]s and plotting routes that avoid them. There are three primary routes used by [[Riedra]]n ships and [[Lyrandar]] vessels, and with a reliable map and a good navigator, you can follow such a path and avoid the planar threats. However, many independent captains—smugglers, spies, [[Adar]]an vessels avoiding [[Riedra]]n patrols—pride themselves on knowing shorter paths. Such routes can save you time and avoid contact with other vessels… but a false map can lead you into gelid water or a shadowy end. Even if a less-traveled route was once safe, there’s a chance of running across an intermittent [[manifest zone]] that was dormant when the cartographer passed through. When you leave the known paths, you may encounter deadly threats—but it’s in these dangerous regions that you might find ghost ships laden with treasure or ancient wonders preserved in [[Risian ice]].\n\nSome of the threats a sailor might find on the Barren Sea are listed below.\n\n!!! Storms\n\nStorms are always a risk on the Barren Sea, but they aren't as dramatic as the [[Lamannia]]-fueled storms of the [[Thunder Sea]]. The exception is to the north, near the [[Demon Wastes]], where the weather is enhanced and twisted by the malevolent powers bound in those lands, and tremendous storms send ships to splinter against the rocky shore.\n\n!!! Dead Calms\n\nThe southern Barren Sea holds a number of large [[manifest zone]]s tied to [[Mabar]]. Occasionally [[undead]] can be found in these regions—animated corpses both of travelers and of strange creatures from deep below the poisoned waters (see the \"Monstrosities\" section below). But these are rare. The primary indicator of a Mabaran manifest zone on the Barren Sea is a region of unnatural calm. Winds die and currents are diverted. Bright lights are dimmed.\n\nAccording to superstition, within a dead calm, the shadows of sailors can come to life and kill their owners, persisting even after the mortal who cast them has died. There are countless tales of merchants stumbling on ghost ships inhabited solely by [[shadow]]s. In the annals of the [[Wayfinder Foundation]], Lord [[Boroman ir'Dayne]] discovers a massive graveyard of ships in the Barren Sea, including vessels that seemed to be from the ancient [[giant]] and [[Dhakaan]]i civilizations. According to the story, Boroman’s own ship was overrun by [[shadow]]s and he was forced to abandon his vessel and flee. His dinghy was overturned and his friends consumed by “shadow sharks,” but—at least according to the tale—Boroman managed to swim for days and made landfall in the [[Demon Wastes]] (which is a story in its own right). Though he tried, ir’Dayne was never able to find the graveyard again.\n\n!!! Gelid Water\n\nWhile there are [[Mabar]]an [[manifest zone]]s across the Barren Sea, to the north they are outnumbered by manifest zones tied to [[Risia]]. These zones are unnaturally cold, home to unexpected icebergs and creeping ice that can potentially trap slower vessels. A few of the largest [[manifest zone]]s have the \"Preservation\" trait of Risia; any creature or object that is completely encased in this [[Risian ice]] is kept in stasis, ignoring the passage of time. Travelers or entire ships could be found trapped in such an iceberg: [[fiend]]s or [[dragon]]s from the [[first age of the world|Age of Demons]], [[Sarlona]]n refugees fleeing the [[Sundering]], or more recent sailors from [[Khorvaire]]. The shroud against [[divination]] makes it difficult to track such prisoners from afar… but there are wonders waiting to be found.\n\n!!! Monstrosities\n\nIn any seedy seaport tavern along the edges of the Barren Sea, one can find a well-seasoned sailor who will tell the tale of an impossible tentacled leviathan who rose from the depths and nearly tore apart their ship. Many of these tales are exaggerated, of course—but not all. Hideous monstrosities do occasionally rise from the uncharted depths, often completely unique in form, never before seen and never to be seen again. \n\n!!! Smugglers, Spies, and Pirates\n\nThe steady stream of merchant vessels provide an inviting target for pirates in the Barren Sea. [[Harmonious Sail]] frigates are ever vigilant, but the shrouding effect of the sea makes it possible for pirates to evade pursuit by plunging into uncharted waters. Of course, this means risking the dangers of a dead calm or gelid waters, but there are always those willing to take that risk. Given the dangers, the Barren Sea isn’t exactly teeming with pirates, but those who manage to thrive in these dangerous waters are often quite capable.\n\nThe shrouding effect also makes the Barren Sea a haven for smugglers—including the [[Dream Merchants]] of [[Riedra]], [[Adarans]] making their way to or from [[Khorvaire]], and others—as well as spies, whether they’re spying on [[Riedra]], [[Droaam]], or elsewhere. Conspiracy theorists claim that many [[dragonmarked house]]s maintain secret facilities on platforms in the Barren Sea, places where they can defy the [[Korth Edicts]].\n\n!!! Sahuagin\n\nThe hypersalinity of the Barren Sea is just as deadly to the [[sahuagin]] as it is to other creatures, and the [[Eternal Dominion]] of the [[Thunder Sea]] doesn’t extend into these western waters. However, there are a few sahuagin clans scattered across the very edges of the Barren Sea. Each of these small enclaves have their own unique cultures; some are peaceful, others vicious and cruel. The most dangerous of these are the [[Sa'arlaath]], “The All Consuming”, near the coast of the [[Demon Wastes]]. But most of the sahuagin of the Barren Sea remain in isolation in the deep, ignoring both the people of the surface and those who dwell in the deepest depths—the [[kuo-toa]].\n\n!! Dreamers in the Deep\n\nThe upper waters of the Barren Sea are deadly, but descend far enough and the unnatural salinity of the water drops. It is here that adventurers can find the terrifying realm of living nightmares. This is the domain of the [[kuo-toa]].\n\nThe kuo-toa are twisted descendants of the mighty \"Quor-Toa\" who once ruled a realm of wonders beneath the waves. Their fierce defense of their territory is the reason that few [[ancient|Age of Giants]] [[giant]] explorers ever reached [[Sarlona]]; there are records in [[Cul'sir]] accounts that describe the glories glimpsed below the waves of the “Golden Sea” and of the godlike beings that defended it. But when the giants severed the direct link between [[Eberron]] and [[Dal Quor]], they unintentionally destroyed the Quor-Toa civilization. Today, the mad fishfolk and their horrid cities are a shadow of what their ancestors had been. See the [[kuo-toa]] page for more information.\n\n!! The Barren Truth\n\nSo why is the Barren Sea so barren? What changed after the [[Age of Giants]], when it was known as the \"Golden Sea\"? What is the cause of the focused magical hypersalinity, and what is it that blocks [[divination]]?\n\nScholars on land have advanced many theories. Perhaps it’s the work of the [[dragon]]s of [[Argonnessen]], an epic curse like those unleashed against [[Xen'drik]]. It could be the handiwork of the [[daelkyr]], or maybe there is an unbound [[overlord]] beneath the waves.\n\nOr perhaps the Barren Sea as it is today is a nightmare of the [[kuo-toa]]. Collectively, they see the world as a barren place of death, and it is this shared nightmare that actively poisons the waters above them. This is a consequence of the wounded psyche of the species, and it’s not something that could be changed by a few friendly conversations. On the other hand, if [[Dal Quor]] itself were to change—if [[il-Lashtavar]] were to give way to [[il-Yannah|Path of Light]] and an Age of Light—perhaps the Great Light could heal the [[kuo-toa]] and life could return to the Barren Sea.",
