title: Lake Arul
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Lake Arul in [[Khorvaire]] links the [[Brey River]] to [[Scions Sound]], and forms part of the border between [[Thrane]] and the [[Mournland]]. On the Day of [[Mourning]], the lake's basin significantly widened as its eastern shore collapsed and shifted into the waters. The entire [[Cyran|Cyre]] village of Totens was totally erased by the ï¬‚ooding and landslides before the [[dead-gray mists]] killed the few residents who made it to high ground.
