Big Bara is the leader of ''Baraâ€™s Breakers'', one of the most distinguished units of the [[Knight Rangers]] and one of four units assigned to the floating fortress [[Argonth]]. The Breakers are made up of 24 soldiers, though they usually operate in six person squads; twelve of the Breakers are [[warforged]], including Bara herself. The Breaker [[warforged]] have chosen ongoing military service over civilian life. Some are devoted to [[Breland]], while others simply enjoy fulfilling the purpose they were made for. 

Bara is surprisingly jovial; she may take pride in being a living weapon, but she also enjoys the flexibility of being a [[Ranger|Knight Rangers]].
