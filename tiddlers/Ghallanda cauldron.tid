Engraved with arcane sigils and imbued with ground Siberys
[[shards|dragonshard]], this cauldron allows someone with the [[Mark of Hospitality]] to prepare food in the blink of an eye. While you have to provide the raw materials, the
Ghallanda cauldron can mystically heat, chill, or flavor contents,
allowing precise control over temperature and replicating the
flavor of spices or herbs you don't possess. While cooking food
in the cauldron, you can reduce its cooking time by 90%, and
you gain [[advantage]] on your attempts to prepare the meal.
