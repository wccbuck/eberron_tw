        "text": "Under the foundries of [[Fernia]], tunnels extend down below\nthe [[Sea of Fire]] into the earth below. These are the domains of\nthe [[dao]]. Like the foundries above them, each has a distinct style\ntied to the sensibilities of the dao who dwells there. Streams\nof lava and pools of fire run through the halls, along with veins\nof metal and minerals. While not as luxurious as the estates of\nthe [[efreeti]], these often showcase the wondrous creations of the\ndao in residence; adventurers could find a hall whose walls are\ndecorated with a thousand swords, or a brass garden filled with\ncunning [[construct]] songbirds. But some dao are paranoid, and\ndeep halls can also contain a host of powerful and deadly traps.",
