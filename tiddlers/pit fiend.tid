A pit fiend is a hulking monster with a whip-like tail and enormous wings that it wraps around itself like a cloak. Armored scales cover its body, and its fanged maw drips a venom that can lay the mightiest mortal creatures low. Fearless on the fields of [[Shavarath]], a pit fiend takes on the most powerful foes in single combat, demonstrating its supremacy and an arrogance that prevents it from acknowledging any chance of defeat.

With an inflated sense of superiority and entitlement, pit fiends form a grotesque aristocracy in whichever [[plane]] they inhabit. In [[Daanvi]], these domineering and manipulative tyrants conspire to eliminate anything that stands between them and their desires, even as they negotiate the convoluted and dangerous politics of the [[Iron Ward]].
