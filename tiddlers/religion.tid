Religion plays an important role in [[Eberron]]. The gods
don't manifest physically, but people of faith believe that
divine forces shape everyday life. Shared beliefs unite
communities and can provide hope in difficult times.

Most Khorvairians acknowledge the pantheon of
the [[Sovereign Host]] and its malign shadow, the [[Dark Six]]. The Sovereign Host was the dominant faith of the
Kingdom of [[Galifar]] and holds sway over most of [[Khorvaire]]—except for [[Thrane]], which favors the Church of the
[[Silver Flame]]. Other religions connect specific cultures
or communities; the [[kalashtar]] observe the [[Path of Light]],
and the [[Undying Court]] guides the [[elves|Aereni]] of [[Aerenal]].

Religion is especially important for a [[paladin]], [[cleric]],
or [[druid]], yet any character can have faith in a higher
power. Following a religion is a way to give your character a deeper connection to the world and a bond to other
members of the community. The Foundation of Faith
table can provide ideas for the source of your beliefs.

| !<<dr d6>> |!Foundation of Faith |
| 1 |You were raised in the faith. Your religion is an important part of your family and community. |
| 2 |Someone you care about—a mentor, a friend, or a lover—introduced you to the faith. |
| 3 |You were raised in a different religion but became drawn to the ideals and beliefs of your current faith. |
| 4 |You never took your faith seriously. Then you made a vow during the [[Last War]], pledging your devotion if a disaster was averted... and it was. |
| 5 |You're devoted to your religion, but you've never been formally educated in its ways. You follow your own personal interpretation. |
| 6 |You had a transcendental experience and believe you have a divine purpose to fulfill. |

Conversely, a lack of faith can also be a meaningful
part of your story. If you don't believe in any divine
power, what caused such doubt? The Rejection of Faith
table offers ideas that can help shape your story. 

| !<<dr d6>> |!Rejection of Faith |
| 1 |You believe that the magic of [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s doesn't come from deities, but from the caster's inner power or belief. |
| 2 |You come from an agnostic community and give little thought to spiritual matters. |
| 3 |You were once deeply devout, but a tragedy during the [[Last War]] caused you to question your faith. |
| 4 |A personal loss or betrayal shook your faith. |
| 5 |You were spiritually scarred by an encounter with a [[fiend]] or [[aberration]]. |
| 6 |You've created your own personal religion and believe that all the established faiths are flawed. |
