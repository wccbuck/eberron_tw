''Population:'' <<ntls>>

Near the western edge of the [[Karrnwood]], the Winter Citadel rises through gray pines, the blue-white stone of its slender towers and delicate minarets sparkling in the light. Fragile bridges span the gaps between, giving the place the appearance of a crystalline web formed from ice. A steep ice wall surrounds the [[feyspire]]. Helmeted guards, their faces hidden behind grim visors, stand guard, watching for enemies and intruders alike.

When the Fortress of Frozen Tears is in [[Karrnath]], [[eladrin]] knights ride forth from the citadel in the dead of night on white horses, bringing winter’s breath to the surrounding woods. Their passing freezes the needles on the pines and leaves icy impressions of their horses’ hooves in the ground. The riders are slender, with pale skin and blue-white hair. Dressed in milky white armor and armed with matching blades, they brook no trespass on their lands, cutting down any interlopers they find.

In the vale surrounding the [[feyspire]], the [[sun|Sun]] never rises, and the [[moon]] [[Rhaan]] always looms much larger than normal overhead. Within this frigid realm, one can find barren orchards and ruined farms all but lost beneath the drifts. The cold reaches beyond one's blood and bone to chill their heart and hopes. On the wind, one can hear a voice behind its howl—an endless song of loss and pain.

Taer Syraen is the seat of the [[Prince of Frost]], and is closely allied with the winter fey of the [[Moon Court]].

!! Four Branches of Winter's Court

[[Shan Syraen|Prince of Frost]] is bound to the spire, granting him great power within his demesne. His subjects are primarily [[eladrin]], with a smattering of other [[fey]] and mortals such as [[gnome]]s who dwell in the [[Moonlit Vale]] of [[Thelanis]]. His court is split into four branches—ancient guilds that tend to the needs of the citadel and its inhabitants. Mortal members of the court choose a branch upon coming of age, with most children following in the footsteps of their parents.

The four branches are:

* [[Hail]], the branch of war
* [[Ice]], the branch of preservation
* [[Sleet]], the branch of intrigue
* [[Snow]], the branch of art and innovation

!! Taer Syraen and House Phiarlan

The [[elves|elf]] of House [[Phiarlan]] discovered this [[feyspire]] and its icy vale centuries ago, and since then, a mixed clan of [[eladrin]] and elves bearing the [[Mark of Shadow]] grew to prominence there. Unhindered by the [[Korth Edicts]], this [[Wintertouched]] clan of [[Sleet]] serves the [[prince|Prince of Frost]] of the Winter Citadel as spies and secret police. Today, the clan leaders seek to explore their relationship with their distant kin in House [[Phiarlan]] and [[Thuranni]], unsure how to proceed.
