title: Cutter
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Cutter is a fanatic follower of the [[Lord of Blades]]. Like her leader, Cutter believes that the [[warforged]] shall rise up and overthrow the “weak-ﬂeshed”
races. She bears the mark of [[Karrnath]] on her brow,
though she abandoned that nation to join the Lord of Blades in the [[Mournland]]. Now, she has come to [[Sharn]] for a purpose. Cutter is part of a team of operatives sent to the City of Towers to steal House [[Cannith]] documents and recover a long-lost [[schema]], a task which begins by shadowing the movements of [[Morgrave University]] Provost [[Bonal Geldem]]. If she is defeated, she sends a [[final messenger]] to her superior, ''Saber'', who is hiding elsewhere in the city.
