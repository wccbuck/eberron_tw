A secret society is any organization whose members are sworn to secrecy about its activities. Most such societies have close camaraderie among members, but restricted membership. Among [[humanoid]]s, secret societies include [[arcane order]]s and [[adventurers' guild]]s, as well as organizations such as the [[Aurum]] and the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]]. Among [[immortal]]s, secret societies include conspiratorial organizations such as the [[Lords of Dust]] and the [[Dreaming Dark]].
