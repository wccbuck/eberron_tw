Some specific instances of Marrath’s outdated grammar opinions are as follows. Marrath prefers irregular verbs: “Pleaded” should be “pled”, “dived” should be “dove”, “dwelled” should be “dwelt” (https://theenglishspace.com/grammar/glossary/irregular-verbs/unusual-irregular-verbs/) . But also, “an” instead of “a” before words that start with H, and verb-first questions like “Saw you that?” instead of “Did you see that?” 

Also they hate “progressive passive” sentence structure and prefers middle voice / passival. So “I was being trained” -> “I was training”. Other sentences like “The clothes were soaking” make sense in modern language, as opposed to the progressive passive “The clothes were being soaked”. But to Marrath, even sentences like “The house is being built” should be “The house is building”. “The meal is being eaten” should be “The meal is eating”.
