Raven is a notorious [[druid]] of the [[Children of Winter]], perhaps the most charismatic and powerful individual within the sect. A sinister figure touched by darkness, she walks the woods surrounded by vermin, and presages the devastating Winter to come. She has formed a pact with an entity she claims is at the heart of the [[Gloaming]], the force that will one day cleanse [[Eberron]]; she fiercely draws distinction between her power and that of [[warlock]]s of the [[Dragon Below|Cults of the Dragon Below]].
