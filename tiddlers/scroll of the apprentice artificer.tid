This scroll contains information and incantations necessary to make a //scroll of the apprentice artificer//. To decipher and use the scroll, you must be an [[arcane|arcane magic]] spellcaster. Creating a new scroll requires 1 day and [[calligrapher's supplies]], which you must know how to use. Once you finish creating your new scroll, the original scroll is consumed in eldritch flames. Your new scroll becomes a //scroll of the apprentice artificer// when the ashes of the original scroll are sprinkled on it.
