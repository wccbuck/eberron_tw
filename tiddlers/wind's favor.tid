type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You create a localized area of strong wind (approximately 30 mph) in a 10-foot diameter cylinder within 100 feet of you. This effect has limited utility in combat, but it is often used to propel sailing craft by wielders of the [[Mark of Storm]]. The wind blows for one hour, or until you dismiss it. With careful concentration, you can change the direction of the wind by 45 degrees over the course of 10 seconds.
