An astral key is an object that allows the bearer to open an [[Astral Sea]] [[color pool]] from either side. This allows access to the Astral Sea, but only from a specific point. Depending on the power of the item, the key could be tied to a single specific point or it could have the power to open any pool the bearer can find. 

The people of the [[Five Nations]] donâ€™t currently possess astral keys; such an item could be a relic of [[Argonnessen]], [[Aerenal]], or the [[Venomous Demesne]], or it could be a unique prototype or breakthrough. Despite the name, an astral key could be any shape; it could be a dagger that slices through the veil of reality, or a paintbrush they must use to paint a doorway in the air.
