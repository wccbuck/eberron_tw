Astalaar was the last high prince of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] to rule from the island of [[Trebaz Sinara]] over five centuries ago. Following in the tradition of her predecessors, Astalaar dedicated herself to augmenting the supernatural defenses of the island, ensuring that no thief or tomb robber would dare steal her treasures. No one knows exactly what she did, but since the moment of her death, no person has set foot on Trebaz Sinara.
