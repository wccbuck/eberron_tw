        "text": "Aejar ir'Wynarn is the fourth son of King [[Boranel ir'Wynarn]] of [[Breland]]. He is sometimes referred to as \"the scarred\" due to the claw marks on his face and neck, as well as a missing left forearm and hand (though he has a fully functional prosthetic). These marks are permanent reminders of an incident in Aejar's childhood in which the young prince repeatedly prodded one of his father's [[magebred|magebreeding]] [[ghost tiger]]s with a wooden sword, heedless of the tiger's warnings; the beast mauled Aejar, and [[Jorasco]] healers were unable to rid him of his scars or reattach his mangled arm. To this day, Prince Aejar has never overcome his fear of his father's palace pets.\n\nPrince Aejar spends very little time in the palaces of [[Wroat]], opting instead to pursue thrills and adventure. He often travels to far-flung locations alongside his close friend, famed explorer Laasha Halli, and a squad of porters, servants, and [[King's Shields]] bodyguards.",
