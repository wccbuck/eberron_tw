A slime-covered worm of immense size, a neothelid is a mutated [[illithid|mind flayer]] tadpole that was never implanted in a donor brain. As a feral thing, a neothelid knows nothing beyond the predatory existence it has lived so far and struggles to comprehend its new [[psionic|psionics]] abilities. Neothelids prowl subterranean passages in search of more brains to sate their constant hunger, growing ever more vicious. These creatures can spray tissue-dissolving enzymes from their tentacle ducts, reducing victims to a puddle of slime and leaving only the pulsing brain unharmed.
