Doran Del Doras is the true power in the [[Sharn]] [[embassy|Zilargo Embassy (Sharn)]] of [[Zilargo]]. [[Tasho|Tasho Mol Doras]] is the ambassador, but Doran is the master of spies, and even Tasho follows his orders. Aside from the embassy staff, Doran has contacts spread throughout [[Sharn]] and across [[Breland]] itself. He has
permanent [[telepathic bond]]s that allow him to communicate with [[Madra Sil Sarin]] and his superior in the [[Trust]] in [[Korranberg]]. 

Doran Del Doras is always expanding his network of informants and spies, and any character—[[gnome]] or not—could be drawn into his web.
