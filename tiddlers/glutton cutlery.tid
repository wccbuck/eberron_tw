This set of ivory cutlery consisting of a fork, spoon, and knife comes wrapped in a small pouch. Any food eaten from these cutlery items does not satiate
feelings of hunger, although it still provides nutrition, and
the capacity of the eaterâ€™s stomach remains unchanged.
This magical effect stops functioning if any of the cutlery
pieces are more than 10 feet away from each other.
