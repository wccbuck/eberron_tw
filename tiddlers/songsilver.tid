The exceedingly rare material known as songsilver is a form of crystallized divine essence or pure faith. The metallic substance resembles smooth, silvery ivory with an iridescent sheen. It is nearly indestructible, and emits a solemn and holy aura. Songsilver might be considered the divine opposite of [[demonglass]].

Songsilver is created though the songs of [[couatl]]s and other [[Siberyan|Siberys]] [[celestial]]s native to the Material Plane. The notes and rhythm of the serpents' song determine the material's shape. During the [[Age of Demons]] before the creation of the [[Silver Flame]], choirs of couatls sang entire monuments and fortresses of songsilver into existence.

The weapon known as [[Kloinjer]], famously wielded by [[Tira Miron]], was formed mostly of songsilver.
