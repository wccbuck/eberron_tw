title: Character Creation
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

To start creating a character for your [[Storyloom]] game, open the [[character sheet template]], and ''clone'' it (click the <$button class=<<tv-config-toolbar-class>>>{{$:/core/images/clone-button}}</$button> button, which may be hidden behind the <$button class=<<tv-config-toolbar-class>>>{{$:/core/images/down-arrow}}</$button> button). Name the sheet whatever you like (player name, your character name, etc). In the top right, the "Edit Mode" button enables you to edit any field on the sheet; when you're done, click "View Mode" to switch out of edit mode and "linkify" any links you've created (e.g. `[[Emerald Claw]]` becomes [[Emerald Claw]]). Even in View mode, you should still be able to edit your stress/harm boxes, your story points, your money, the order of your items/talents/spells (drag and drop), and your notes. Unfortunately, this does mean you won't be able to create clickable links in the notes section.

Alternatively, you can just use pencil and paper for everything!

!! Character Creation Steps

* Name your character.
* Fill out at least three of your five [[aspect]]s, including your Description.
* Distribute the following scores across any of your [[actions and attributes|Actions and Attributes]]:<br/> 2, 1, 1, 1, 1.
* Choose two [[talent]]s that cost 1 [[experience point]]. If you take [[Spellcaster]] or something similar, add any [[spell]]s you gain access to.
* Choose two [[language]]s your character knows (typically [[Common]] and one other).
* Add any items you want to start with (subject to GM approval). Examples: [[thieves' tools]], [[herbalism kit]], or [[explorer's pack]].

!! Group Creation

Depending on the nature of your campaign, you may want to create a [[group character sheet]]. This sheet holds information about your adventuring party. The "Assets" column can be used for items, territory, or any other resource your group has access to. The "Supply" box can represent anything from food stores to [[dragonshard]]s. Feel free to use the [[progress clock]]s for various projects and trackers, such as morale or reputation.
