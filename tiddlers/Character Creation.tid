To start creating a character for your [[Storyloom]] game, open the [[character sheet template]], and ''clone'' it (click the <$button class=<<tv-config-toolbar-class>>>{{$:/core/images/clone-button}}</$button> button, which may be hidden behind the <$button class=<<tv-config-toolbar-class>>>{{$:/core/images/down-arrow}}</$button> button). Name the sheet whatever you like (player name, your character name, etc). In the top right, the "Edit Mode" button enables you to edit any field on the sheet; when you're done, click "View Mode" to switch out of edit mode and "linkify" any links you've created (e.g. `[[Emerald Claw]]` becomes [[Emerald Claw]]). Even in View mode, you should still be able to edit your stress/harm boxes, your story points, your money, the order of your items/talents/spells (drag and drop), and your notes. Unfortunately, this does mean you won't be able to create clickable links in the notes section.

Alternatively, you can just use pencil and paper for everything!

!! Character Creation Steps

* Name your character.
* Fill out at least three of your five [[aspect]]s, including your Description. If you're looking for some inspiration for unique [[Eberron]]-specific aspects, see [[character secret]]. If you can't think of anything for all five, that's okay; you can fill those out as you play and get to know your character.
* For each pair of opposite [[approach]]es, choose one that best suits how your character solves problems, and write "1" in the box for that approach. Ask yourself: does my character prefer using Force or Savvy? Flair or Guile? Speed or Caution? Your choices will determine your bonuses when [[making attempts|Taking Action]].
** Alternate rule: If the GM approves, you may instead assign //two// points to one approach of your choice, and one point to a second approach, leaving the other four at zero. This allows for greater differentiation among a party of player characters, but the GM should take note that this slightly raises the characters' power level, as they can start at +3 [[impact]] when they make attempts.
* Choose [[talent]]s with costs that add up to 3 [[experience point]]s. If you take [[Spellcaster]] or something similar, add any [[spell]]s you gain access to. Also take note of any prerequisites the talents may require.
* Choose two [[language]]s your character knows (typically [[Common]] and one other).
* Add any items you want to start with (subject to GM approval). Examples: [[thieves' tools]], [[herbalism kit]], or [[explorer's pack]]. If you are equipped with [[armor]], click the <$button class=<<tv-config-toolbar-class>>>{{$:/images/add}}</$button> button under "special harm" to add your bonus [[harm]] box (see the [[armor]] page for more info).

!! Group Creation

Depending on the nature of your campaign, you may want to create a [[group character sheet]]. This sheet holds information about your adventuring party. The "Assets" column can be used for items, territory, or any other resource your group has access to. The "Supply" box can represent anything from food stores to [[dragonshard]]s. Feel free to use the [[progress clock]]s for various projects and trackers, such as morale or reputation.
