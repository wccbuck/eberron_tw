Forming a pact with an arch[[fiend]] of fire and greed, he conquered the city of [[Ram'kanek]] and the surrounding area, founding what would be called the [[Sulat League]] (Sulat means \"Fire-bound\" in [[Old Giant|Giant]]). The ensuing war between the nations of Adaxus and Cul'sir was nearly cataclysmic, as the Sulat summoned swarms of [[demon]]s to clash against the Cul'sir [[oneiromancers|oneiromancy]]. As the Fire Prince's hunger for power and victory transitioned into madness, a group of six Sulat [[titan]]s rose up to defeat and seal him away. Five of these titans went on to become the [[Five Luminaries]] of the [[Sulat League]]; the sixth was [[Ju'qat Reskan Taq]].",
