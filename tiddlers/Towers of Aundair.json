        "text": "Four great fortresses essentially define the border\nbetween [[Aundair]] and [[Thrane]] to the west and\n[[Breland]] to the south. [[Wrogar Keep]], [[Tower Valiant]],\nand [[Tower Vigilant]] stand along the Thrane border,\nwhile [[Vanguard Keep]] guards the plains between the\n[[Blackcaps|Blackcap Mountains]] and the [[Eldritch Groves]], near the border\nwith Breland. Each fortress has a high watch tower\nsurrounded by magically fortified walls and less obvious magical defenses.\n\nA brigade of about 700 soldiers garrisons each\nkeep, with the equivalent of a tiny village helping to\nsupply the soldiers with food, arms, and repairs. The\nsoldiers include standard infantry, archers and [[wand-wielding specialists|wandslinger]], and at least one unit of cavalry or dragoons (mounted infantry).",
