title: twitch oil
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This thin, colorless oil smells faintly of ozone. It can cover a corpse as large as a horse or [[ogre]], and takes about a minute to apply. The affected corpse twitches randomly for an hour. If another creature touches the corpse during this duration, that creature suffers a painful electric shock, and the effect ends immediately.
