title: stone of commanding earth elementals
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

If the stone is touching the ground, you can speak its command word and summon an
[[earth elemental]], as if you had cast the [[conjure elemental]] spell. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn. 

The stone weighs 5 pounds.
