        "text": "The Broken Land of [[Lamannia]] is a volcanic region filled with high\nmountains and lava plains. There are constant eruptions, and\nthe layer is home to many fire and earth [[elemental]]s that engage\nin an ongoing environmental conflict. Fire elementals flow\nout with the lava as volcanoes erupt; earth elementals work\nto contain the eruptions and to rebuild the shattered peaks,\nonly to have them erupt again. Few beasts manage to thrive in\nthis layer, but some tough [[dinosaur]]s have clawed out a niche.\nWhile this region has fewer connections to [[Eberron]] than the\n[[Twilight Forest]], it's also possible to find remnants of other\ntravelers here; it's a harsh and deadly landscape for stranded\nadventurers or for those who seek a lost relic from this place.",
