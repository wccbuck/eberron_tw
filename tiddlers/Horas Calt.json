        "text": "The \"Bandit King of the Whistling Woods\" is the title adopted by Horas Calt during his infamous career. Born in [[Breland]] in [[845 YK|Khorvaire calendar]], Calt developed impressive [[sorcerous|sorcerer]] powers and soon turned his magical abilities to crime. He earned his place in the songs of [[bard]]s by being the first man to rob the [[lightning rail]], and ultimately settled in the depths of the \"Whistling Woods\" (more commonly known as the [[Greenhaunt]] today). Many vagabonds and rogues joined his gang, and it is said that he found allies among the [[fey]] spirits of the wood.\n\nA group of [[Sentinel Marshals]] of House [[Deneith]] finally cornered the Bandit King in 872 YK. The battle left a trail of destruction across the woods, and in the end Calt threw himself onto a fire to avoid capture. It was a great victory for House Deneith, but some [[bard]]s maintain that Calt's friends among the [[fey]] saved him from the flames and spirited the Bandit King away to the [[plane]] of [[Thelanis]], where he lives to this day.",
