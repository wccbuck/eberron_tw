        "text": "The Bitter Sea lies between [[Khorvaire]] and [[Frostfell]]. It includes [[Eldeen Bay]] and [[Karrn Bay]] to the south. Floating icebergs are a serious hazard in these waters, particularly in the summer months when they shear off the Frostfell and drift south into important shipping lanes\njust off Khorvaire. Despite its inland location, [[Thrane]] has always made\nan effort to maintain a presence in the Bitter Sea alongside ships from\n[[Aundair]] and [[Karrnath]].",
