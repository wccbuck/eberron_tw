''Sovereigns:'' [[Kol Korran]], the [[Keeper]]

Although known for their greed, [[dragon]]s who follow the [[Sovereign archetype]] of the master of the hoard are shrewd negotiators and students of history. The hoarders play a critical role in the [[Chamber]], because they have the strongest grasp of economic forces and their influence over [[humanoid]] lives.

Some take this one step farther, treating life and death as simple negotiations and seeking to collect actual souls as Talons of the [[Keeper]]. A few go so far as to become [[dracolich]]es, but unless this is sanctioned by the [[Eyes of Chronepsis]]—a rare occurrence indeed—the dragon could be hunted down and destroyed.

[[Rogue dragon|rogue dragon]]s who follow the master of the hoard archetype dedicate their lives to growing their trove of treasure. This includes the classic "greedy dragon on the mountain," but some hoardmasters might try to control the flow of commerce in a town of [[humanoid]]s and accumulate wealth through legitimate trade, or perhaps focus on building collections of specific categories of artifacts. Certainly the higher Concordians of the [[Aurum]] include at least one master of the hoard in disguise.
