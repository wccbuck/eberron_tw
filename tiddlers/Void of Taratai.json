Each of those spirits has a five-day period each year\nin which its memory is honored. During this period, kalashtar of the spirit’s lineage pause to reflect on the memory of their [[quori]] ancestor.\n\nWhile sixty-seven [[quori]] spirits reached [[Eberron]], only sixty-six are still in existence. The lineage of [[Taratai]] has been completely eradicated. The five days that were originally set aside for Taratai’s line have become a period of mourning for the entire [[kalashtar]] race. During these five days, all kalashtar gather to remember the exodus and the birth of their race, and to ensure that they never lose another line. Recently, the [[atavist]]s have made an extra effort to strike out against the [[Dreaming Dark]] during the Void, to take vengeance for the soul that was stolen.",
