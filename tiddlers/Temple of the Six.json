        "text": "Before the rise of the [[Silver Flame]], it was not uncommon to find people\nwho openly worshipped the [[Dark Six]], either hungry\nfor power or making sacrifices to placate the dark\ngods. Temples to the Six were usually built in hidden\nplaces, and when [[Sharn]] was created, an enormous\ntemple to the Dark Six was constructed beneath the\ncity. In 484 YK, [[Flamekeeper|Keeper of the Flame]] Jalus Baine led a force\nof the faithful and exterminated the followers of\nthe Six, and the temple was quickly ransacked. But\nit was not completely destroyed. Currently, it serves\nas the headquarters of [[Daask]] and the home of the\n[[oni]] [[Cavallah]]. Cavallah respects the [[Mockery]] and the [[Shadow]]\nand has restored their altars, but for the most part\nthe temple was simply a convenient base of operations. She has established a range of defenses in the temple, and brought a variety of unpleasant beasts\nfrom [[Droaam]]: [[grick]]s, [[displacer beast]]s, [[basilisk]]s,\nand an assortment of other deadly creatures. The\nwealth gathered by Droaam lies in the vaults of this\ntempleâ€”but seizing it would be a dangerous task.\n\nMany of the [[Dark Six]] have other worshippers\nin [[Khyber's Gate]], who have established hidden\ntemples; these folk generally practice their faith in\nprivate and have little contact with [[Cavallah]]. \n\nThe head priest of the Temple of the Six is [[Ash]].",
