Also known as the docks of [[Cliffside]], this district is rough and dirty. Its taverns frequently host brawls, while the inns and bordellos offer travelers a wide variety of ways to be cheated or robbed.

A party traveling to [[Stormreach]] by ship would likely depart from this district. As an example, the ship known as the [[Kraken's Wake]] frequently runs between the two cities, departing from Greenman Pier.
