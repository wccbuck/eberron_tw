The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends (up to 1 minute later), your weapon rings with thunder that is audible within 300 feet of you, and the attack deals extra [[force damage|damage type]] to the target. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it may be pushed up to 10 feet away from you and knocked prone.
