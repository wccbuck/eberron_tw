Dolgrims are squat, deformed things. Warped by the [[daelkyr]], a dolgrim is essentially two [[goblin]]s crushed into one creature, their misshapen body boasting four arms and a pair of twisted mouths that gibber and slather at the front of a headless torso. The two mouths of a dolgrim sometimes carry on demented conversations with one another. However, a dolgrim has only a single personalityâ€”sadistic, bloodthirsty, and brutally dedicated to serving itself.

Small numbers of these creatures sometimes make their way to the surface, often under the command of [[dolgaunt]]s, and undertaking missions advancing the inscrutable schemes of their malevolent masters. But great hordes of dolgrims remain clustered in [[Khyber]] with the [[daelkyr]], dreaming of the day when they will be released into [[Eberron]] to feast and destroy.
