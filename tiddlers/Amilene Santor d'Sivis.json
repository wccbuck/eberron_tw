The Sivis [[gnome]]s maintain no [[enclave]] per se in the city, but they have a space of\ntheir own outside the offices of the [[Citadel of the Twelve]]. Thanks to good relations with the [[dwarves|dwarf]], House Sivis keeps private offices inside the [[Kundarak]]\n[[enclave|Kundarak Enclave (Stormreach)]]. These offices contain a message station (with two active [[speaking stone]]s), the First Stonespeaker’s private office, and a small but valuable arcane library of which she is especially proud and the maintenance of which\nshe oversees personally.\n\nFirst Stonespeaker Santor keeps a tight rein on magical services, and all subordinates must consult her before providing certain [[Mark of Scribing]] services to those outside the house. Amilene rarely leaves the confines of [[Coasthold]], but she has garnered a citywide reputation for being cordial and approachable\nin her space, and she enjoys being a neutral party in [[Stormreach]].",
