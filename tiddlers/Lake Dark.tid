title: Lake Dark
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The pitch-black waters of Lake Dark shimmer in the farmland in eastern [[Karrnath]]. Fed by the cold runoff of the [[Iron River]], Lake Dark is a large body of mist-shrouded water that collects in a depression in the fields
between the [[Icetop Mountains]] and the [[Talenta Plains]]. The
small towns of [[Lakeside]] and [[Irontown]] flank Lake Dark, and
smaller farming communities encircle it.

Many believe that spirits haunt Lake Dark, and that the pitch-black waters provide a pathway to [[Dolurrh]], a location from which the living can sometimes speak with the dead. Lake Dark is in fact a [[manifest zone]] connected to the realm of the dead, and spells related to [[necromancy]] have greater power when cast in proximity to
its dark, restless waters.
