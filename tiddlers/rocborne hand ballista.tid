This massive, beast-hunting crossbow is carried with its two handles from above instead of by being held from below. This crossbow fires two bolts at a time, and emits a [[roc]]-like screech each time it's fired. Creatures struck by projectiles launched from this weapon may find themselves dazed and unable to move for a few seconds.
