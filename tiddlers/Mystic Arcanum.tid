Your [[warlock]] patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one [[legendary-tier|spell tier]] spell as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without
expending any [[stress]] or completing a [[progress clock]]. You must rest for at least six hours before you can do so again.
