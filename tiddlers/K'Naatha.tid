This dour [[stone giant]] is the captain of the [[Arnaaracaex]]. K’Naatha is an imposing figure, striding through the city in [[mithral]] chainmail, his greatsword slung across his shoulders. More than six hundred years old, K’Naatha was a young sergeant of
the [[Arnaaracaex]] during the bloody Battle of [[Arnaarlasha]]’s Fall. In the aftermath, he and his comrades claimed the skulls of the [[rogues|rogue dragon]] that had fallen to
their blades. Today, those [[Moontower|Moontowers]] skulls remain a grim warning to any who would threaten this place and its people.

As the oldest resident of the city, K’Naatha is an exceptional source of lore from [[Io'lokar]]’s middle period. He is also the only non[[dragon]] who knows [[Arnaarlasha]]’s and the [[Warders]]’ true motives for creating [[Io'vakas]] and [[Io'lokar]] after it, a secret passed down by his father. What those motives might be rests with the GM.
