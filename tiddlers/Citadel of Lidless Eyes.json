Across its warped and liquid expanses, thousands of eyes of every size and shape peer into the endless darkness. [[Beholder|beholder]]s, [[dolgrim]]s, and stranger [[aberration]]s dwell within the halls of the citadel, which is one of the few places where such creatures are willing to live side by side.\n\nSome beholderkin serve Belashyrra as guards and agents, while others spend their lives in deep meditation, pursuing inner visions known only to the Lord of Eyes. It's rumored that anyone who sits on the citadel's throne can see through the eyes of any sentient creature on [[Eberron]] or in [[Khyber]].",
