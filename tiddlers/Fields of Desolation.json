It is no more than a hundred yards square, but\nthis area has seen enormous bloodshed throughout the\nhistory of [[Khorvaire]]. Mundane geography might play a\npart in the siteâ€™s importance, since the rolling hills around\nit tend to channel armies through the fields, but its ties to\nShavarath are almost certainly more significant.",
