Oneiromancy is the magic of dreams. It is a lost [[Externalist|Externalist Theory]] [[school of magic|spell school]] which was pioneered by the [[Cul'sir Dominion]] during the [[Age of Giants]]; some say it was the dreamshaping powers of the [[kuo-toa]] which inspired the Titan King [[Cul'sir]] to develop this [[arcane science|arcane magic]]. The [[titan]] oneiromancers and somnitects of the Cul'sir Dominion shaped lucid dreams to sustain their kingdom, weaving them into its very foundations. When the [[planar|plane]] link to [[Dal Quor]] was severed after the destruction of [[Crya]], the foundations of oneiromancy were also severed, which significantly damaged the core infrastructure of the Dominion and stripped the power of the dream [[wizard]]s.
