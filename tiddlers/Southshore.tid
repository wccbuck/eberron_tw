Running along the southern edge of [[Starmantle Bay]], this small quarter was the entertainment hub of [[Metrol]] and a center for tourism. It contained a
host of inns, theaters, and restaurants, as well as
the major temples and shrines of Metrol, including the famous [[Cathedral on the Hill]]. Most of Southshoreâ€™s permanent residents were associated
with the businesses found here.
