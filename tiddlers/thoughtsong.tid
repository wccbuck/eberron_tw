Telepathy is an integral part of
[[kalashtar]] [[culture|Adarans]]. All kalashtar possess a minor ability
to share their thoughts. Some kalashtar musicians hone
this gift, and instead of relying solely on sound and
music, they entwine their works with threads of pure
emotion and mental imagery. Some thoughtsingers
can produce broad ranges of emotions, while others
specialize in single emotions. Kalashtar thoughtsongs
are very moving to those who can perceive them, but
the range of the telepathic ability is considerably more
limited than that of the human voice.
