Is there a chivalric order associated with the school? "Order of the Dawn Chorus" maybe?

Also: Is there a team of divine champions that seeks out graduates of the Temple who defect to another country or break their oaths? Maybe a paladin of the Martial Temple goes along with a group of [[Sentinel Marshals]].
