        "text": "When the engineers were building [[Blackbones]], they discovered a bizarre\nphenomenon—a small pool of cool, crystal-clear water\nsurrounded by a larger pool of blazing lava. In addition to surviving the heat, the water actually seemed to be replenished by an unseen source. Curious, a [[dwarf]] priest ordered a forge set up near the pool. A skilled smith, he found that if he used the heat of the lava and then tempered his work in the cool water, his work\nwas far better than what he was used to producing. He\ndeclared the site to be the work of the sovereign lord\n[[Onatar]]. Today, smiths and metalworkers from across\n[[Khorvaire]] come to [[Sharn]] to be blessed at the pool. A\ntemple has been built around the pool, and services\nto Onatar are held within. Those who seek a special blessing are allowed to dip their hands into the water, which is said to enhance their own talents.\n\nThe powers of the pool may be largely legendary, but they are not completely false. Anyone who tempers a metal item using water from the pool receives an [[advantage]] on the attempt, though the priest rarely allows anyone to take water from the pool. And if a [[cleric]] or [[paladin]] casts a [[divine magic]] while calling on [[Onatar]] within 10 feet of the pool, they have advantage on that roll.\n\nThe current caretaker of the pool is actually a [[warforged]] named [[Weld]]—one of the few warforged priests on [[Khorvaire]].",
