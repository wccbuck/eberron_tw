[[Black Iron]] in the [[Marketplace]] of [[Stormreach]] is run by the [[eneko]] smith Hular, one of the best in the city. He runs the smithy efficiently, but age is taking its toll. He is preparing his children to take over the business, but his youngest daughter,
Solarca, is eager to live a more adventure-filled life. She might seek to join a group investigating the ruins of the [[giant]]s, or strike out on her own in a quest to steal a husband from the [[eneko]] of [[Dar Qat]]. If her ambitions lack an outlet, she might turn to the [[Titans]].
