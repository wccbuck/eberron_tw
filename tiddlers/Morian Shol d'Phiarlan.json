From the house's [[enclave|Phiarlan Enclave (Stormreach)]] in the [[Temple District]], Morian arranges entertainment for the taverns, inns, and theaters in the city. Although the\n[[Serpentine Table]]—[[Phiarlan]]’s espionage division—has operatives scattered in the city, Morian deals in the arts, not in intelligence. The eyes of the house study anyone who comes in search of secret services; if the job is worthwhile and the resources are available, a Phiarlan agent approaches the prospective client to discuss the deal. Morian doesn’t even know the identity of the Serpentine spymaster, though he’s certain that this agent works out of the [[Onyx Fountain]].",
