He always has interesting news to share, and a knack for offering advice that makes people reconsider their opinions. What people don't realize is how often Rusty's news or advice shakes things up in the long term, the butterfly's wings that sets the storm in motion. This is because he's a mentor of the [[Traveler]], and the rumors he shares often come to him through divine inspiration.",
