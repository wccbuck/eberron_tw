Clever and charismatic, the [[Tharashk]] [[triumvir|Tharashk triumvirate]] Khandar[['Aashta]] has great ambition and a dark heart. He is constantly pushing his fellow triumvirs, seeking to expand the power of [[Tharashk]] even if it strains their relations with the rest of the [[dragonmarked house]]s. Khandar is a follower of the [[Old Ways|Cults of the Dragon Below]]; it’s up to the GM to decide if he’s a [[Whisperer|Whisperers]], pursuing the [[Inner Sun]], or if he’s tied to a different and more sinister tradition. While he is ruthless when it comes to expanding the power of the house, he does believe in the union and wants to see all the clans prosper.
