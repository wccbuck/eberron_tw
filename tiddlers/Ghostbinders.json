        "text": "The Ghostbinders (//Lelatu//) are an organization and faction within the [[Sulatu]] who blend the Promise of Fire with the faith of the [[Silver Flame]]. In their interpretation, the Ghost Flame (//Sul Shuluc//, as the Sulatu call the Silver Flame) is not a guarantee of safety; it is a tool that mortals must wield. The [[celestial]]s of [[Fernia]] teach us that the flame in the darkness, the tiny flickering light of hope, is fragile, and may flutter out; thus, the Lelatu see the Ghost Flame as a torch to be carefully tended, and passed from generation to generation. They call upon the Flame to empower their skills, believing its revelations to be the memories of Ghostbinders who have gone before.\n\nGhostbinders do not govern any [[Sulatu]] communities, and no children are raised in their faith. Their order is entirely voluntary, and prospective initiates are strongly discouraged. Only those truly willing to become like [[ghost]]s to protect the people of [[Xen'drik]] can complete the initiation.\n\nGhostbinders have worked in the past with the [[Hantar'kul]] and even the [[Silaes Tairn]] of [[Aerenal]] to neutralize traps and other threats in ancient [[giant]] ruins. Lelatu are particularly skilled at dealing with bound [[fiend]]s and [[undead]], but they also possess the strange ability to disable traps by simply triggering them, relying on their conviction-based [[divine magic]] to protect them from harm.",
