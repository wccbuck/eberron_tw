[[Stormreach]]'s temple to the [[Devourer]], Shargon’s Talon is a stone tower jutting from the harbor. Its shape is more reminiscent of a stalagmite than a worked building, but the [[continual flame]]s illuminating its narrow windows
suggest otherwise.

Followers of the [[Sovereign Host]] occasionally make sacrifices to
the [[Devourer]] when natural disasters threaten, but the
congregation of the Talon places the Devourer above all other gods. The doctrine of this sect holds that it was the Devourer alone who defeated the [[fiend]]s of the
first age, and that the force of this battle raised the
lands above the sea. The faithful are taught to embrace
the fury of nature, preparing for the time when the
Devourer will scour the earth and draw all back beneath
the waves. The holy texts also speak of devouring the
strength of fallen foes; though it’s possible to read these
literally, most of the faithful would never go so far as to
practice cannibalism.

One of the more unusual aspects of the cult of the Devourer is the fact that emissaries from the [[sahuagin]] of the [[Eternal Dominion]] often participate in the sacred rituals. These priests consider [[human]]s to be flawed cousins, stripped
of scale and weak of lung, but they pity these humans
and consider it an act of charity to help them find the
right path.

Members of this sect are expected to be skilled
swimmers, and although some take rowboats out to the
Talon, swimming the distance is considered an act
of devotion.

Although the [[Devourer]] is the primary deity of this
sect, the faithful are also taught to respect the [[Fury]].

The two high priests of the sect are the [[sahuagin]]
Khalaash and the [[elf]] Seryssa. The extent of their mystical abilities—if
any—remains a mystery.
