type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

//Tyasha is an [[elven|elf]] woman of indeterminate age and haunting beauty. Her long silvery hair ﬂows like glowing moonlight, and her emerald eyes shine with mystery. She wears a ﬁne [[glamerweave]] gown of shifting blues and greens, but no clothes could match the perfection of her form and features. When she speaks—which she rarely does—her voice is like a song, nearly hypnotizing with its music.//

Tyasha d’[[Phiarlan]] is a legend in the theatrical world.
She has been an actress for over ﬁve hundred years,
and her performances at the [[Grand Stage]] and [[Sharn Opera House]] typically command sold-out crowds from across [[Breland]]. Wealthy connoisseurs of the theater travel all the way from [[Fairhaven]] and [[Korranberg]] to see Tyasha perform, and ticket prices may be up to ten times the usual cost. Most believe that Tyasha is
worth the price; her skills are remarkable and she has
one of the ﬁnest singing voices on the continent.

Tyasha’s life has been surrounded by rumor and
mystery. Some say that she died 200 years ago, and
that the current Tyasha is a [[changeling]]; others claim that she is a [[vampire]], a story fueled by the elaborate crypt she had built into her mansion in preparation for her eventual death. Some tales claim that Tyasha never existed at all, and that the [[Entertainers and Artisans Guild]] of House [[Phiarlan]] invented her using their shadow magic. She is said to have been the lover of three kings, including [[Jarot|Jarot ir'Wynarn]], the last king of [[Galifar]].

Tyasha rarely emerges from her mansion. She uses her own company of actors and musicians who practice in her private theater. She only appears at the actual performances, and even then she usually travels by [[shadow step]], using a [[dragonmark reservoir]] to travel to and from the theater.

Shadow is the lifeblood of House [[Phiarlan]], and the house has gone to great eﬀorts to cultivate her legend. While she rarely leaves [[Sharn]], any theater in [[Khorvaire]] would be honored to host one of Tyasha’s shows—allowing her Phiarlan retinue free access to any city. In her youth, Tyasha was herself a master spy in addition to a performer. Today, her venerable age prevents her from undertaking strenuous physical activities. However, Tyasha is one of the most skilled [[bard]]s in [[Khorvaire]], rivaled only by the masters of [[Zilargo]], and her skills at espionage have not diminished.
