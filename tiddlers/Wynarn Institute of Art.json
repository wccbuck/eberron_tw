        "text": "The Wynarn Institute, located in [[Metrol]], [[Cyre]], was both one of the foremost academies of magic in [[Khorvaire]] and one of its most amazing museums. Focusing on [[illusion]] and [[conjuration]] magic, the institute was widely renown for its explorations of the artistic potential of the [[arcane|arcane magic]]. Treasures of the pre-[[Galifar]] kingdoms were displayed in its museum along with modern works of art. In addition to these exhibits, the Hall of Kings allowed visitors to converse with illusory replicas of the past rulers of Galifar. Though some cultures preserve their rulers so they can advise successors—such as the [[Aereni]] [[elves|elf]] and the [[medusa]]s of [[Cazhaak Draal]]—the [[illusion]]s of the Hall of Kings were merely a tourist attraction.",
