Solve mysteries, but remain unknown.\n\nNarathun is a small [[clan|Mror clan]], but has always had power. The mythic\nhero Narathun was the lone [[wizard]] of the exiles, and their\npeople hoarded this knowledge. Narathun was renowned for\nits [[magewright]]s, especially its oracles; while they draw rubies\nand sapphires from their mines and produce beautiful jewelry,\nsecrets have always been one of Narathunhold's primary exports.\nNarathun [[dwarves|dwarf]] appreciate tragedy and sacrifices. The clan\nis known for its artists and its [[bard]]s; its work is unquestionably\nbeautiful, but certainly more morbid than that of other clans;\nit's no accident that its largest city is called [[Shadowspire]].\n\nIn the modern age, the [[dragonmarked house]]s and\ntraditions of [[Galifar]] have brought [[magewright]]s to all holds.\nBut its oracles are still respected, and the Ebon Library of\nShadowspire is the one of the finest schools of [[divination]]\nin [[Khorvaire]]. Narathun sages have always asserted that no\nknowledge should be forbidden, and Shadowspire holds\ntemples both to the [[Shadow]] and to the [[Blood of Vol]]. Clan\nNarathun is fascinated by the [[Realm Below]], though it lacks\nthe forces to push as deeply into Sol Udar as it would like, and\nNarathun patrons might well employ adventurers willing to risk\ntheir lives in the depths. Narathun [[artificer]]s have embraced\nthe study of fleshcrafting; while they are no match for [[Mordain the Fleshweaver]], they have made remarkable developments\nover the past few decades. Narathun [[bard]]s have also developed a form of [[thoughtsong]] through their contact with the benevolent [[flumph]]s.\n\nNarathun dwarves hold long grudges. They have never\nforgiven [[Toldorath and Tordannon]] for thefts that occurred\nbefore the [[Great Sorrow|Mror History]], and despise [[Droranath]] for a murder that\noccurred eight centuries ago. [[Doldarun]] has long condemned\nNarathun for its “foul practices,” and its pursuit of fleshcrafting\nhas exacerbated this. However, the other clans value its jewels\nand its knowledge, and others have always stood in between\nNarathun and [[Doldarun]]. [[Soldorak]] and Narathun are staunch\nallies, reinforced by their interest in the [[Realm Below]].\n\nA character from Narathun lends itself more to introspection\nthan interaction and bargaining, and Narathun dwarves are\nmore likely to be [[artificer]]s or [[wizard]]s than [[warlock]]s. Narathun\nentertainers and [[bard]]s produce haunting works; the College\nof Whispers is an appropriate choice. This is also an excellent\nclan for hermits, acolytes, or clerics tied to the [[Dark Six]] or the\n[[Blood of Vol]]. Despite the propaganda spread by Clan [[Doldarun]],\nNarathun dwarves are no more likely to be evil than any others.",
