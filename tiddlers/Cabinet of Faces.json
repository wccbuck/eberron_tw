        "text": "Moving unnoticed among the \"single-skin\" [[humanoid]] races, the\n[[changeling]] and [[doppelganger]] members of the Cabinet of Faces pursue an agenda known only to themselves. Spies, assassins, and other agents serving the cabinet\nwork in every level of society, from back alleys to government palaces.\n\nMany don’t believe that the cabinet even exists, dismissing the idea of a secret cabal working to guide major governments and enterprises to some nefarious end. Yet the Cabinet of Faces is very real, with highly placed informers, spies, and assassins. Its goals and desires are perhaps the most closely held secret in the world.\n\nThe Cabinet of Faces is ruled by a group of six [[doppelganger]]s, each controlling six subordinate members (doppelgangers or [[changeling]]s) called visages. A visage always deals with the same cabinet ruler and never knows the identity of any other. One such visage is the changeling named [[Per]]. In turn, the thirty-six visages control a network of over a thousand affiliates, almost all of whom have no idea who ultimately employs them.\n\nThough the Cabinet of Faces took little part in the [[Last War]], the war’s aftermath has seen the current cabinet rulers expanding their operations, marshaling their forces for some large action in the near future.\n\n",
