        "text": "The seat of [[Xorchylic]]’s power, the Keep\nis the strangest building in [[Graywall]]. The [[mind flayer]]\ntook a personal hand in its design, and its walls are\nwhorled and rounded; at times they gleam with an\niridescent sheen. Fifty elite troops of the [[Flayer Guard]] are garrisoned\nwithin the tower, and it is fortified to withstand a\nsiege. Xorchylic’s throne sits on the third floor, and it\nspends most of its time in this great seat, listening to\nthe thoughts of the town and plotting an incomprehensible revenge against the [[daelkyr]] and Xorchylic's home [[demiplane]].",
