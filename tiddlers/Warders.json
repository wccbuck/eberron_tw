        "text": "The Warders were a group of a dozen [[dragon]]s dedicated to improving the lot of\n[[Argonnessen]]â€™s lesser (non-dragon) races. They established the city of [[Io'vakas]] in the [[Vast]] as a sort of walled garden to empower and cultivate [[humanoid]]s, [[giant]]s, and other creatures. When Io'vakas was destroyed 1200 years ago, one of the twelve Warders, [[Arnaarlasha]], was able to save a few of the refugees and founded the neighboring city of [[Io'lokar]] in the doomed city's ashes. The rest of the original Warders disbanded, but today, [[dragon]]s sympathetic to the cause of the lesser races continue to protect and guide the inhabitants of Io'lokar.",
