title: wax seal of protection
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This wax seal is carved with arcane sigils and is often used by the [[Notaries Guild]] of House [[Sivis]]. When used to seal a letter, that letter cannot be opened by anyone but the
addressed recipient, as if you had cast the [[arcane lock]]
spell on it. 

Once you have used the seal, it can't be used
again until the next dawn.
