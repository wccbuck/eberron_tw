For anyone who has spent any time in [[Lower Dura]] in [[Sharn]], the Sprawl may feel oddly familiar; in fact, the layout of the oldest parts of Sharn may have been inspired by visions of this demiplane.\n\nWithin this realm, in inner court of fiendish houses constantly compete in intrigues that shift their positions, while an outer court of immortal urchins and gangs maintain a more disordered network of feuds and vendettas.\n\nThe ''Academy of Offalion'' is a place in the Sprawl where agents of [[Eldrantulku]] hone their skills at diabolical subversion. The entire academy rearranges itself to simulate specific population centers on Eberron—palaces, senatorial chambers, marketplaces—where fiendish students take part in mock intrigues. Each exercise has its own rules and victory conditions, and the stakes of these games are savagely real. Winners are sent into the world to execute their well-rehearsed schemes, while losers are demoted and viciously punished. Occasionally, mortals are pressed into service for these exercises as stand-ins, advisors, or wildcards.\n\nThe Sprawl has the [[Embrace the Unknown]] property of [[Kythri]].",
