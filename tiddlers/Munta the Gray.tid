Munta the Gray is the chief of the [[Gantii Vus]] clan of the [[Ghaal'dar]] of [[Darguun]]. The wily old chief was one of Lhesh [[Haruuc Shaarat'kor]]'s first and strongest allies, though many of the chiefs of other clans believe Munta could have been able to challenge the warlord in the wake of the Darguun uprising, if he'd chosen to. Munta was the first to suggest establishing a seat of the Lhesh's power in neutral territory, converting a frontier [[Cyran|Cyre]] town into what would become the great city of the [[Ghaal'dar]] ([[Rhukaan Draal]]).

While powerful and burly in his glory days, Munta is advanced in years and has grown rather fat from inactivity.
