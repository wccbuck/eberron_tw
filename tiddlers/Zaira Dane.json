        "text": "Lieutenant Zaira Dane is in charge of the [[Sharn]] branch of the [[King's Wands]]. A devout follower of [[Dol Arrah]], Zaira believes that you cannot have justice without honor. Zaira despises Captain [[Talleon|Talleon Haliar Tonan]] and believes that his amoral actions are a blemish on the honor of the [[King's Citadel]], but she lacks the authority to do anything about it. Technically the King’s Wands of Sharn are only supposed to support the actions of the [[Dark Lanterns|King's Dark Lanterns]], but Zaira often acts on her own in an attempt to battle injustices that Talleon refuses to deal with. For his part, Talleon believes that Zaira is a naïve idealist who wastes time chasing after “evil”—the true work of the Citadel is protecting the crown, and good and evil are luxuries\nin this line of work. There are twelve additional members of the King’s Wands, including several specialists in [[evocation]] and [[divination]], as well as a [[cleric]] of [[Aureon]].",
