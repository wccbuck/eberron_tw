Skabatha Nightshade is the oldest member of the [[Hourglass Coven]], the three [[hag]]-like [[fey]] of past, present, and future. Better known as Granny Nightshade, she offers her assistance to those who are haunted by regret. Her deals often result in cruel twists; for example, a petitioner who asks to be reunited with a lost love might be transformed into one of their loved one’s cherished items, such as a favorite bonnet.

Skabatha assumes the guise of an old toymaker. Part toy herself, she has a windup key between her hunched shoulders that rotates quickly when
she’s in a good mood and slows down as her mood sours. When she is furious, the key comes to a dead stop. 

Skabatha possesses [[truesight]] out to a range of 60 feet. She can cast the spells [[detect magic]], [[druidcraft]], [[speak with animals]], [[polymorph]], [[remove curse]], [[speak with plants]], [[awaken]] (without the eight hour casting time), and [[plane shift]] (herself only). She can also shrink herself down to the size of a doll.

!! Appearance

Skabatha appears as a short, thin, gnarled woman swathed in a tattered dress with petticoats. Cracked white face paint plasters her features, with
crimson splotches on her cheeks and thick mascara coating her sparse eyelashes. Underneath her makeup, her flesh is textured like rotten bark and
infested with wood lice and fungus. The windup key sticking out of her back is a part of her body and no easier to remove than one of her limbs.
Skabatha roams her domain on a flying rocking horse, which creaks horribly as it moves.

!! Skabatha's Weakness

Skabatha always forgets the first creature she sees when she awakens each morning. Until she sleeps again, that creature is completely invisible to her, even when she uses her [[truesight]].
