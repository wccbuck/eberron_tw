When you pour this flask of swirling oil into a lamp or lantern and light it, the lamp comes to life as though you had cast the spell [[animate objects]] upon it. The lamp is considered [[creature tier]] ''1'', and its attack deals fire damage. The lamp remains animated until the oil is exhausted (about 2 hours), the flame is extinguished, or the lamp is incapacitated.
