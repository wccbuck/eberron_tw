title: letter of dispensation
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Each nation in [[Khorvaire]] has its own set of laws and regulations. In some cases, however, the leader of a nation might want to grant specific individuals the right to act outside the law. In these instances, the government issues a letter of dispensation. Such letters always closely detail exactly what permissions the bearer is givenâ€”for example, the right to seize and destroy property belonging to suspected seditionists, or the right to kill any monsters found within certain geographical boundaries. 

Letters of dispensation cannot be bought; they are issued by a high-ranking government official only to select and trusted parties. The letter always bears the seal of the nation along with a [[Sivis]] [[arcane mark]], and it specifies to whom the dispensation is granted. (The document is not considered valid without matching [[identification papers]].)
