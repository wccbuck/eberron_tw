Lyssia Lyrriman d'Sivis was one of the greatest pioneers of [[arcane magic]] in [[Khorvaire]]'s history. She was on the forefront of House [[Sivis]]'s research into the science of sigilry and the paths of [[divination]] and [[illusion]], and developed the foundation of ''elemental sigils'': the verbal and somatic components used by most modern [[externalist|Externalist Theory]] [[wizard]]s.
