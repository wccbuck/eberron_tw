House Cannith was\nbased in [[Cyre]], and the [[Mourning]] destroyed the house\nleadership and key facilities. Now three barons jockey\nto fill the leadership vacuum: the [[alchemist]] [[Jorlanna|Jorlanna d'Cannith]] of\n[[Fairhaven]], weaponsmith [[Zorlan|Zorlan d'Cannith]] of [[Korth]], and [[Merrix|Merrix d'Cannith]] of [[Sharn]], innovator of [[warforged]]. It remains to be seen\nwhether one of these leaders will unite the house, or if it\nwill shatter under the strain. If you're an heir of House\nCannith, you should decide which of these barons you\nserve or if you have other ideas about the house's future.\n\n!!

History of House {{!!title}}\n\nThe [[Mark of Making]] first appeared among the [[human]] traveling tinkers and artisans of the Cannith clan of [[Cyre]] around 2,200 years ago. Between the magic of the mark and its members’ natural inventiveness, Clan Cannith steadily increased its power and influence, creating its own areas of jurisdiction throughout Cyre and central [[Khorvaire]]. An active and enthusiastic participant in the [[War of the Mark]], House Cannith found itself one of the most powerful of the [[dragonmarked house]]s after the war.\n\nHouse Cannith used that power to forge partnerships. At the end of the\n[[War of the Mark]], House Cannith worked with the other [[dragonmarked house]]s to establish the [[Twelve]]. They allied with the [[elemental]]\nbinders of [[Zilargo]] and the scions of House [[Lyrandar]] to create [[elemental ships|elemental galleon]] to sail Eberron’s seas. Emboldened by that success, House Cannith’s [[magewright]]s collaborated with House [[Orien]] on the [[lightning rail]]. House Cannith also helped\nto establish the network of [[message stations|speaking stone]] that\nHouse [[Sivis]] uses to facilitate communication across\n[[Khorvaire]].\n\n!!! The Last War\n\nWhen the [[Last War]] began, House\nCannith found itself acting as arms dealer to all five\nof the combatant nations, a position that allowed it to\namass fantastic wealth and an unparalleled degree of\ninfluence among the [[Five Nations]]. But selling weapons and armor was only the beginning. In 965 YK, the first [[warforged]] soldiers marched out of Cannith’s\n[[forgehold]] at [[Whitehearth]], and soon House Cannith was supplying not only weapons but also the soldiers that wielded them.\n\nHouse Cannith’s unbounded prosperity lasted\nalmost thirty years. But in a single moment on the\nDay of [[Mourning]], House Cannith lost its leader,\nBaron [[Starrin d'Cannith]], many of its [[dragonmark]]ed heirs, and the [[Whitehearth]] forgehold. The [[Treaty of Thronehold]] made matters worse for the house,\nbecause it set the [[warforged]] free and banned House Cannith from making more. With the [[Five Nations]] at peace, Cannith’s role as arms dealer to the world\ndiminished.\n\nThese recent setbacks have made House Cannith’s leaders more determined than ever before to reverse the house’s fortunes, and have highlighted the rivalry among the house’s leadership. At any given moment, Cannith’s inventors are sequestered in secret laboratories across [[Khorvaire]], trying to create something even more dramatically world-changing than the towers of [[Sharn]], the [[lightning rail]], or the [[warforged]].\n\nSince 994 YK, Cannith has been a house divided. So\nmany of [[Starrin|Starrin d'Cannith]]’s heirs and the house’s elders died on\nthe Day of [[Mourning]] that not only was it unclear who\nwould succeed Starrin, but in the weeks and months\nafter the disaster, House Cannith couldn’t gather\ntogether enough leaders to enable the succession to\nbe determined. Eventually three rivals emerged, each\nhaving only a distant link to Starrin d’Cannith. The\ncontenders claim roughly equal support within the\nhouse, so the matter cannot be resolved through consensus. Each would-be baron is involved in multiple plots against the other two.\n\n!! Three Canniths\n\n[[Merrix|Merrix d'Cannith]], [[Jorlanna|Jorlanna d'Cannith]], and [[Zorlan|Zorlan d'Cannith]] are each determined to become the next leader of House Cannith. Between\nthem, they have divided the lords seneschal so evenly that\na new baron will likely never be chosen. As it stands,\nthe divided leadership makes it increasingly likely that\nonly death or disaster will change the balance of power.\n\n* [[Cannith South]]\n* [[Cannith West]]\n* [[Cannith East]]\n\n!! Guilds and Organizations\n\nThe house has two [[guild|trade guild]]s that are responsible for the lion’s share of Cannith’s postwar profits.\n\n* the [[Fabricators Guild]]\n* the [[Tinkers Guild]]\n\n!! Enclaves\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}tag[enclave]sort[title]]\">>",
