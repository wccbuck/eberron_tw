title: sleep-tight bathing salts
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This small cloth pouch contains enough fragrant salt for a
single bath. You can sprinkle the salts into a tub of hot water, consuming them. If you soak in the water for 1 hour, and then fall asleep within 1 hour, you only need 4 hours of sleep to get an excellent night's rest. Only one creature can benefit from this effect.
