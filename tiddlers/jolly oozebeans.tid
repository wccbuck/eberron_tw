Jolly oozebeans typically come in packs of 4. Roll a number of d8's equal to the number of oozebeans in the pack, and record each number rolled; use these numbers to determine the kinds of oozebeans found in the bag using the table below. Each oozebean color has an effect that lasts for 1 minute when you eat it.

You can only be under the effects of 1 oozebean at a time. Eating an oozebean while under the effects of another one causes the effects of the first to immediately end and be replaced by the new one's. This rapid change is difficult to stomach, and may result in a fit of nausea that lasts for about a minute; resistance or immunity to poison ameliorates this side effect.

|!<<dr d8>> |!Color |!Effect |
| 1 |White |You can breathe underwater. |
| 2 |Black |You have resistance to acid damage, and can safely eat otherwise inedible and nonpoisonous organic materials. |
| 3 |Blue |You sweat an acidic substance; grappling or being grappled deals acid damage to the other creature. |
| 4 |Gray |You have [[advantage]] to resist being magically charmed or frightened. |
| 5 |Gold |You can climb as fast as you can run. |
| 6 |Red |You gain a temporary extra [[harm]] box. |
| 7 |Green |You have [[advantage]] to resist poison and to escape grapples or restraints. |
| 8 |Yellow |You have [[advantage]] to resist lightning damage, and immunity to damage from the [[magic missile]] spell. |
