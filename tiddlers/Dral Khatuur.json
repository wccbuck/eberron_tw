She is the winter that steals the [[sun|Sun]], the terror carried on the icy winds howling in the night. Those who venture out into the icy dark may never return... and if they do, they may merely be [[simulacra|simulacrum]] of victims of the killing cold, sculpted by the Heart of Winter to drain the warmth of hope from the living.\n\nDral Khatuur has few allies, if any. She does not have a speaker among the [[Lords of Dust]], and none among the [[rakshasa]] work to bring about her release.",
