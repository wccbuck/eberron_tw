Moody lady, eventually [[Oath of Vengeance]]. She comes to the unity dinners with Arien and [[Cadoc Belmin]] for a while but maybe rejects the community after a while. Belmin might feel sympathy for her bitterness but has found a healthy way to channel his anger and regrets. She might eventually leave the school and become an Oathbreaker.
