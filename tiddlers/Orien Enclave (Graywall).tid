title: Orien Enclave (Graywall)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This large [[Orien]] [[enclave]] in the [[Calabas]] of [[Graywall]] is designed to support multiple caravans at once, and it is currently operating below capacity. The [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] are interested in establishing trade routes and eventually [[lightning rail]]s within their realm, and they have subsidized House Orienâ€™s operations in [[Droaam]].
The local Viceroy, Saria d'Orien, is a canny negotiator and has formed close ties within the town. Her daughter, Habra d'Orien, has a huge gambling debt, and as a result may be manipulated by the powers of [[Graywall]] for her [[Mark of Passage]] and access to Orien resources.
