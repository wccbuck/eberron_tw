''Population:'' <<ntls>>

Sylbaran is a small city the [[Eldeen Reaches]], near the border with [[Breland]] and [[Droaam]]. It sits between the [[Byeshk Mountains]] and [[Silver Lake]], and is located on [[Orien Route 7|Border Road]]. A century ago, Sylbaran marked the southern border of [[Aundair]]. During the [[Last War]], Aundair made the decision to focus its forces to the east; leaders decided that the agricultural towns to the west were expendable. [[Brelish|Breland]] troops seized Sylbaran in [[950 YK|Khorvaire calendar]] and occupied the city for six years, during which time bandits and Brelish pillagers wreaked havoc across the region. The [[Wardens of the Wood]] brought this chaos to an end, uniting Aundairian peasants and [[druid]]s of many sects to drive out the invaders and scavengers. In 956 YK, the Warden alliance drove the Brelish troops out of Sylbaran, and now it marks the southern border of the [[Eldeen Reaches]].

!! Overview

Sylbaran is one of the largest Eldeen settlements, and it is remarkable in many ways. It serves as a garrison, recruiting center, and training facility for the [[Wardens of the Wood]]—maintaining a force ready to protect the Reaches from any southern aggression, while also bringing in recruits from the smaller hamlets and farmsteads scattered around the Reaches. While the Wardens are the largest [[druid]]ic sect and take the most interest in maintaining the Reaches, Sylbaran has representatives from two of the other major sects—the [[Children of Winter]] and the [[Greensingers]]. While these druids use their powers to help the community, they also act as missionaries and recruiters, sharing their traditions and preparing their students for pilgrimage into the [[Towering Wood]]. This reflects the alliance forged by the Wardens during the fight for Eldeen independence—the farmers of western [[Aundair]] and the druidic initiates of the [[Towering Wood]]—working together for the greater good. The notable holdout among the sects is the [[Ashbound]]; Sylbaran may be a relatively small city, but it is still too civilized and industrial for the Ashbound extremists.

Throughout the [[Eldeen Reaches]], [[Warden|Wardens of the Wood]] initiates work with farmers, hunters, and fisherfolk. Unlike the [[Ashbound]], the Wardens don’t oppose metalworking, [[arcane magic]], or basic industry; their focus is on sustainability and minimizing damage to the environment. [[Gleaner|gleaner]]s use [[plant growth]], [[mold earth]], [[druidcraft]], and other rituals to enhance farming and construction. Beyond this, Sylbaran is a focal point for the commerce with the southern nations. Well-developed docks handle shipping on [[Silver Lake]], with warehouses filled with Eldeen produce waiting to be picked up by [[Orien]] caravans. 

Despite this, Sylbaran is unmistakably an [[Eldeen|Eldeen Reaches]] community. Much of the Sylbaran’s illumination is provided by bioluminescence. Swarms of bees support the Warden peacekeepers. The fisherfolk sing fish into their nets. While much of the town still uses the pre-Eldeen infrastructure, the newer buildings are made from shaped earth—not unlike the [[quickstone]] structures of [[Threshold]], though not as durable. Many of these are on the edge of town, but there are a few in the center, replacing buildings that were destroyed during the [[Brelish|Breland]] occupation.

Overall, the people of Sylbaran are happy folk who love their town and the natural world around it. Most Sylbarans know their neighbors and are always ready to lend a hand to other members of the community. They prefer harmony to strife and prefer to solve problems peacefully when possible. But they’re quite used to dealing with outsiders who don’t share these ideals. While Sylbarans are patient with travelers, there are limits to this patience. Animal abuse will not be tolerated, and someone seen urinating in the lake is likely to be thrown in it. The townsfolk stick together, and if someone sees a crime being committed, they will typically raise a hue and cry and get involved, rather than passing by. However, there are always new outsiders who don’t know the ways of the Reaches, so trouble can always be found.

!! Interesting Things About Sylbaran

* Sylbaran lies on the edge of [[Silver Lake]], and fishing is an important industry in the town. Silver Lake has ties to [[Thelanis]] and is home to [[fey]] spirits. The Thelanian connection is strongest along the southern coast, but there is magic in the water. The [[Greensinger|Greensingers]] [[Stillwater]] and their initiates help to keep the lake peaceful, and there’s almost always a Greensinger [[gleaner]] singing on the docks. The fisherfolk of Sylbaran are likewise known for singing as they fish, songs honoring both the fish and the fey.
* Sylbaran is celebrated for its bees. Honey is a specialty of the town, and its most important export. Beyond this, swarms of bees patrol the town and assist the [[Warden|Wardens of the Wood]] peacekeepers; outsiders who cause trouble will soon find that the justice of Sylbaran stings swiftly!
* Sylbaran is also home to a tremendous population of fey-touched fireflies. At night, these fireflies light the streets. Most homes have shuttered “lightning lanterns;” these are left outside the home or in an open window, and at dusk fireflies flock to these lanterns. Some people like to call Sylbaran the “city of stars,” in reference to the glittering clouds that fill its skies at night.
* Sylbaran has outposts for the [[Wardens of the Wood]], the [[Greensingers]], and the [[Children of Winter]]—one of the only open outposts of the Children beyond the [[Towering Wood]]. These outposts can provide support for adventurers with ties to those sects or those who wish to contact them.
* There are a handful of [[awaken]]ed beasts and plants in Sylbaran, a legacy of the Warden uprising. You never know when a shrub or a bird might strike up a conversation with you.

!! Businesses and Locations

Most of the communities of the [[Eldeen Reaches]] are self-sustaining hamlets and villages. Sylbaran is remarkable due to its focus on commerce. As a result, there are many locations that can be of interest to adventurers.

!!! Dragonmarked Services

While many [[dragonmarked house]]s are interested in Sylbaran, the town council has prevented a number of them from establishing outposts in the town. The [[Children of Winter]] vehemently oppose any dealings with House [[Jorasco]], and the council has denied House [[Deneith]]’s request to establish a garrison and House [[Lyrandar]]’s proposal for a [[storm spire]] and [[airship]] docking tower. However, there are a few services adventurers may find useful.

* [[Bank of Sylbaran]] ([[Kundarak]])
* [[Liondrake's Roar Sylbaran Outpost]] ([[Tharashk]])
* [[Sylbaran Station]] ([[Orien]])
* The [[Stampede]] ([[Vadalis]])
* The [[Sylvan|Sylvan (theater)]] ([[Phiarlan]])

!!! Room and Board

Weather permitting, many of the people of Sylbaran prefer the outdoors to the confines of a tavern. There are two common gathering places, on opposite ends of town.

* [[Lake's Edge]]
* The [[Haven|Haven (Sylbaran campsite)]]

Travelers who prefer to take their meals and nights indoors have a few options.

* The [[Gold Dragon Inn|Gold Dragon Inn (Sylbaran)]]
* The [[Golden Hour]]
* The [[Welcoming Boughs]]
* The [[Good Berry]]

!!! Religious Services

The majority of the people of Sylbaran respect the traditions of the [[Wardens of the Wood]], and the druid [[Raegan Oak]] and the [[awaken]]ed tree [[Dew-on-the-Leaf]] hold services in the meadows west of town. The Wardens seek to find a path of harmony between civilization and the wild, drawing on the best aspects of each world and using them to help the other side prosper. The [[Greensingers]] hold their services at [[Lake's Edge]], where the [[druid]] [[Stillwater]] shares stories and keeps the peace between Sylbaran and the [[fey]] of [[Silver Lake]]. The [[Beekeeper]] resides in the massive apiary to the north of Sylbaran, and the [[Children of Winter]] join her there, but their services aren’t open to outsiders. None of these [[druid]]s will sell their services, and none have the power to reincarnate the fallen or to [[raise the dead|raise dead]]. Funerary services are generally conducted by the [[Children of Winter]], who bury the dead in the gardens around the apiary; beautiful flowers bloom over the mass graves.

While the residents of Sylbaran largely follow one of the druidic traditions, there is an old temple of the [[Sovereign Host]] that is maintained by [[Mils Holt]], an [[elf]] who has lived in the region for hundreds of years.

While the [[druid]]s of Sylbaran don’t sell their services, one of the most important things they do is teach. This is one of the few places beyond the [[Towering Wood]] where groups of aspirants study the druidic mysteries. All three of the sects represented in Sylbaran have students and Initiates. Most will only ever be [[gleaner]]s, but some may develop great skill with [[primal magic]]—and if you’re such a character, Sylbaran could be where you learned your skills.

!!! Other Locations and Services

Local farmers and artisans from the surrounding villages bring their goods to Sylbaran, and most commerce occurs in the ever-changing open market. Food, herbal remedies, handmade clothing, druidic [[magic item]]s, and many more can all be acquired in the market of Sylbaran. Notable permanent establishments include the following.

* [[Karch Tanners]]
* The [[Hardy Haft]]
* [[Balm & Bloom]]
* [[Druella Grayroot]]'s hut

There are relatively few [[magewright]]s in Sylbaran, but there are [[gleaner]]s—the [[primal|primal magic]] equivalent—who can perform some of the same functions; notably, there’s a squad of gleaners who can cast [[control flames]] who deal with any fires that break out in town.

The [[shifter]]s of Sylbaran largely live on the northeastern edge of the city. Some live in earthen buildings in the town; others pitch their tents in the tall trees on the edge of the [[Haven|Haven (Sylbaran campsite)]] meadow. They’ve built a [[hrazhak]] field north of the Haven, and while this sport can be challenging for non-shifters, a number of the townsfolk have taken up the challenge.

!! Important People

The oldest families in Sylbaran are ''Karch'' (traditionally hunters and tanners), ''Oars'' (fisherfolk), ''Landon'' (livestock), ''Field'' (farmers). There are many other families in Sylbaran, but these four are the largest, and someone who carries one of those names likely has a lot of friends in town. There is also a significant population of [[shifter]]s in Sylbaran, most of whose forebears fought alongside the [[Wardens|Wardens of the Wood]] during the liberation of the [[Reaches|Eldeen Reaches]] and chose to stay by the water’s edge. These shifters don’t use family names, but as a community they’re known as the ''Graykin''—a reference to a legendary champion of the [[Towering Wood]]. One of each of these five "families" make up the Sylbaran town council.

Notable individuals in town include the following.

* The [[Beekeeper]]
* [[Dew-on-the-Leaf]]
* [[Dosun Oars]]
* [[Raegan Oak]]
* [[Stillwater]]
* [[Tala Landon]]

!! Law and Order

The [[Eldeen Reaches]] don’t enforce the [[Code of Galifar]]. Justice is administered by the town council, which is made up by one representative of each of the four oldest families and by a representative of the Graykin [[shifter]]s; the [[Warden|Wardens of the Wood]] advisor [[Raegan Oak]] advises the council. Minor crimes and disruptions of the peace are dealt with directly by Warden Commander [[Dosun Oars]] and the Warden peacekeepers . Brawls driven by passion are largely dismissed as long as there’s no lasting damage done, and fighting in self-defense is acceptable. Those who commit minor crimes will be given a chance to compensate the victim of their actions and undo the damage they have done; those who are unwilling to do so will be scarred across one cheek and driven across the [[Eldeen River]]. Perpetrators of more serious crimes will receive harsher punishments; nature can be merciless, and killers who can’t find a way to make up for the damage they have done may be executed. Perhaps the strangest aspect of justice in Sylbaran is the bees. Thanks to the [[Beekeeper]], swarms of bees can be found patrolling Sylbaran—and when commanded by a Warden peacekeeper, these swarms will target criminals.

Sylbaran is a garrison for the [[Wardens of the Wood]], and there can be up to two hundred Warden soldiers in residence. Generally, half of these troops will be patrolling the region—traveling between the villages and hamlets, watching for bandits, monstrosities, and other threats. The Wardens have fortified the bridge that crosses the [[Eldeen River]]—known as the Eldeen Ford—and perform a quick search of all coaches and caravans that cross it. [[Blast disk|blast disk]]s and similar military-grade weapons aren’t allowed and will be confiscated. The guardians of the Ford have [[fey]]-touched fireflies that can [[detect magic]], changing color to indicate the [[school|spell school]]; they use these to identify [[evocation]] items, and to spot [[bags of holding|bag of holding]] and [[illusion]]s.
