type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You touch a willing [[beast]]. For up to an hour, you can choose to see through the beast's eyes and hear what it hears, and continue to do so until you choose to return to your normal senses. While perceiving through the beast's senses, you gain the benefits of any special senses possessed by that creature, though you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.
