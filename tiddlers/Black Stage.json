        "text": "The largest of [[Io'lokar]]’s amphitheaters is known as the Black Stage for its shadow-magic-augmented performances. The master of the Black Stage is the [[gnome]] [[Thinrukidis]]. \n\nMusic, drama, and oratory are the cornerstones of Io’lokar cultural life, and\nperformances in the [[Terrace]]’s and [[Sunward]]'s many theaters are attended\nby all the [[folk of the city|Io'lokari]]. Epic dramatic works incorporate\n[[illusion]] and [[planar magic|Externalist Theory]] in their production, while\nincomparable musical and oratory performances make use of illusion and mild [[enchantment]] effects to heighten the audience’s perceptions. Lost works of pre-[[Inspired]] [[Sarlona]], ancient [[Xen'drik]], and the [[Dhakaan]]i Empire\nare often heard here, possibly revealing ancient lore or\nadventure hooks.\n\nPCs can also seek to perform on the city’s stages—the\n[[Io'lokari]] are always hungry for new tales and ballads from\ndistant lands. In addition to performers bartering their efforts for lodging and other favors, a successful performance improves dispositions within the city for one week.",
