A bespectacled gnome who runs the [[Pestle]], what appears to be a simple apothecary shop in the [[Marketplace]] of [[Stormreach]], Tyrl deals in some of the foulest substances known to Eberron—mainly [[poison]]s and [[disease]]-causing agents. He also maintains an impressive collection of potions, though who knows when he’ll poison one just for fun.
