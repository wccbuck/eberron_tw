        "text": "Between two and three centuries ago, Golan Thunder was an [[elf]] prince of Stormkeep, a domain in the mainland [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. He was a tyrant who maintained power through an alliance with a [[blue dragon]] who dwelt in the nearby [[Ironroot Mountains]], who destroyed anyone who challenged him. While Stormkeep was a small domain, Golan built it up in remarkable ways, commissioning stunning works of architecture and recruiting exceptional mercenary soldiers, a court [[wizard]], and fine artists. \n\nIn fact, Golan wasn't allied with a dragon... he //was// the dragonâ€”''Golantyx the Thunderer'', a tyrannical [[guide of the weak]]. He ruled for over a century, but he eventually fell prey to the influence of the [[Daughter of Khyber|Tiamat]] and sought to conquer the surrounding principalities. A great champion of the age (perhaps [[Harryn Stormblade]]?) challenged the tyrant, first in elf form and then as a dragon, and the wounded Golantyx was forced to abandon his domain. His fate is not known.\n\nGolantyx's personality and his mark on history reinforced the stereotype in the [[Five Nations]] that [[blue dragon]]s are vain and easily insulted, and that they enjoy collecting talented and exceptional minions.",
