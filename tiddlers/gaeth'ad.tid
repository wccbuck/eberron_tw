Gaeth'ad is a powerful [[orc]]ish herbal sedative tea that can be brewed with a variety of effects. It is popular in the [[Shadow Marches]] and among members of House [[Tharashk]], and is generally brewed and served by the master of a gaeth'ad house.

Concentrated gaeth'ad essence is sometimes used by Marcher bounty hunters to keep their detainees docile; it is especially useful for keeping spellcasters restrained.
