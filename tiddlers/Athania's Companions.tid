type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

One of several “escort services” providing companionship to visiting diplomats in [[Ambassador Towers]] as well as well-to-do
clients in all of [[Sharn]]'s best neighborhoods, Athania's Companions is unique in at least one respect: it is also a spy ring in the business of collecting,
cataloging, and selling secrets. [[Athania|Athania d'Phiarlan]] runs both businesses. The
escorts of Athania's are people of beauty and intelligence, trained in the arts of conversation, seduction, and deception. After spending time with a client, they prepare an intelligence report for Athania, who finds interested buyers for any
significant items.
