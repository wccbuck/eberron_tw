Primary crops of Mistmarsh and surrounding area: rice, water chestnuts, cranberries

Notable members:

* Arien's father, Oarsen Grimbold, a [[gleaner]] and gardener
* Arien's mother, Vylae, an [[elf]] herbalist and former resident of [[Pylas Pyrial]]
* [[Alben ir'Clarn]], sheriff
* Joherra, town reeve, respected farmer or businesswoman
* Priest: Reverend Ebinor. Arien's temple is the Church of [[Arawai]]'s Grace. The other Sovereign Host church in town, the Sovereign Sanctuary, is primarily attended by Cyran refugees; the quiet, steadfast faith in the Sovereigns preached by that temple has evolved in recent years in an attempt to make sense of the [[Last War]] and the state of the world.

Many refugees from [[Cyre]] moved to Mistmarsh after the [[Mourning]]. The population has grown from just over 800 to 1200 over the last four years. Because of this rapid growth, folks have been trying to get House [[Orien]] to build a [[trade road|Orien trade roads]] from [[Tamarack]] to Mistmarsh, perhaps all the way to [[Heeson's Ferry]].

The town should have:

* Manor house for the reeve
