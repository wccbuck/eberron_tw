Dragonhawks are enormous birds of prey, easily large enough to carry a human on its back in flight. Their beaks are heavy and sharply pointed, their heads tufted with long, pointed feathers, and their eyes bright yellow with irregularly-shaped pupils. A single long, gently curved feather juts up above a dragonhawk's four nostrils at the base of its beak, and a large claw juts from the joint of each wing.

In the heraldry of [[Khorvaire]], [[Aundair]] is represented by a majestic dragonhawk, the symbol of its high ideals and aspirations. Above the rolling plains and fields of Aundair, dragonhawks soar through clear skies. Their aeries are hidden in the highest mountains. The largest and most majestic dragonhawks serve as mounts and companions to esteemed champions of the [[Knights Arcane]].

The legendary First Aerie, deep within the [[Eldeen|Eldeen Reaches]] wilderness, is home to some of the largest dragonhawks in [[Khorvaire]].
