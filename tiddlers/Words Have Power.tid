title: Words Have Power
tooltip: universal property: promises are magically binding
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While on a [[plane]] with this property, words—and particularly promises—have power. Creatures should be very careful about making formal agreements of any sort, especially with [[archfey]]; the more powerful the signatory, the graver the consequences of breaking a promise. The price varies, a slightly broken promise to a greater fey might simply result in a run of bad luck, with [[disadvantage]] on the next few rolls. On the other hand, a promise to an archfey could inherently carry the power of a [[geas]]. The fey themselves are bound by this restriction—though they are aware of it and are exceedingly careful with their promises.
