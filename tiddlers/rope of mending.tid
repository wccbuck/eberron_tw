You can cut this 50-foot coil of hempen rope into any number of smaller pieces, and then speak a command word and cause the pieces to knit back together. The pieces must be in contact with each other and not otherwise in use. A //rope of mending// is forever shortened if a section of it is lost or destroyed.
