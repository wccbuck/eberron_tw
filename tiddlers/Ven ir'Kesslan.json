        "text": "Ven ir'Kesslan was a duke of [[Cyre]] who founded the kingdom of [[New Galifar]] in [[Q'barra]] in 928 YK. He was the grandfather of King [[Sebastes ir'Kesslan]] who rules New Galifar today.\n\nThe [[Last War]] shattered the existing order in [[Galifar]], setting the [[human]] nations\nof [[Khorvaire]] against each other. However, a good number of [[Galifar]] nationalists refused to embrace what they saw as the petty grasping for power of royal scions. Rather than join in the conflict, these patriots sought refuge outside their broken kingdom.\n\nOne such idealist was Duke Ven ir’Kesslan, who petitioned his monarch—King Connos of [[Cyre]]—to grant him the right to settle the lands east of the [[Endworld Mountains]]. In the territory the [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] corsairs called “cursed [[Q'barra]],” he would found a new kingdom based on the ideals of fallen Galifar.\n\nUnder the watch of the Cyran military, ir’Kesslan and thousands of like-minded folk set out in a colonial fleet. Though a third of his ships were lost to pirates, war, and weather, those colonists who made landfall did so near [[Adder Bay]], founding a settlement\nat what is now [[Adderport]].\n\nAs they tried to raise their new home within the jungle, the settlers inadvertently disturbed numerous sites holy to the native [[lizardfolk]], [[dragonborn]], and [[kobold]]s. Such actions sparked intermittent hostilities that the settlers typically won. The dragonborn pressed the colonists hardest, but through diplomacy, ir’Kesslan managed to secure a tenuous peace.\n",
