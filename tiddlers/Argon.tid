Argon is the [[language]] spoken by the tribes of the [[Seren]] islands off the coast of [[Argonnessen]], as well as many of the [[dragonborn]] of the [[clanholds|dragonborn clanhold]] of [[Q'barra]]. It is rooted in [[Draconic]] with influence from the old pre-[[Sundering]] language of [[Rhiavhaar]], similar to modern [[Riedran]].
