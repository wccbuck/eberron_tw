The restaurants and taverns of Olladra's Kitchen
are neither the dens of drunken revelry common in
other lower wards nor the high-class, high-priced
eateries of [[Upper Central]] or [[Skyway]]. They are generally subdued, specialty restaurants and taverns that
serve as meeting places for artists and ideologues.
