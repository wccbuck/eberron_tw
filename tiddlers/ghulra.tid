Every [[warforged]] has a unique feature: the sigil engraved on its forehead. These symbols are as individual as human fingerprints, but were not designed by human hands. When [[Aaren d'Cannith]]'s first [[construct]] emerged from the creation forge, it bore a symbol on its forehead, and the second had a different sigil. Aaren's dedicated [[dwarven|dwarf]] [[magewright]]s called these symbols "ghulra," a [[Mjordai]] word for "truth."

[[Warforged|warforged]] adopt names to deal with [[human]]s, but when dealing with each other, the ghulra serves as an important form of identification. A warforged may wear a hood to conceal its forehead from strangers, but when among friends most prefer to leave the symbol visible. While someone could gouge away the symbol, the ghulra is a part of the warforged in a way nobody truly understands; when someone uses repair or cure spells on the warforged, a damaged ghulra is restored to its original shape. While it cannot be permanently destroyed, a warforged can cover its ghulra or attempt to use disguise to place a false mark over its real one.
