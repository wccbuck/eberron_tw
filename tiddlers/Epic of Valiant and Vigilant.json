        "text": "Popularized some forty years ago by [[Aundair]]’s bards, this tale takes about forty-five minutes to recite—and most Aundairians have heard it so many times that they can recite it from memory. The Epic of Valiant and Vigilant describes the twin sieges of [[Tower Valiant]] and [[Tower Vigilant]] in 951 YK, told from the perspective of two lovers, each trapped within one of the castles but believing the other to be safe.",
