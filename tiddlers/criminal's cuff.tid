This wide, heavy cuff of blackened iron can only be removed by the person who put it on. It appears to be a simple cuff; however, when the command word is spoken, the cuff suddenly weighs 500 lbs, forcing the wearer to the ground until the command word is spoken again. If spoken by the wearer, the command word has no effect.
