type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Three-Dragon Ante is a popular card game played throughout [[Khorvaire]]. The deck consists of eighty cards, broken up into ten suits of seven cards, each representing one type of [[dragon]]. The remaining ten cards differ depending on the variant of the game ("mortals", "[[deities|Dragon Gods]]", and others). Over the course of three rounds, players make bets and build sets of cards, in an attempt to form the strongest "flight" and collect the stakes.
