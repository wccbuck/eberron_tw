According to the myth of the [[Progenitor Dragons]], after the Progenitors created much of the universe, the deceitful [[Khyber]] tore her brother [[Siberys]] apart. The scales of Siberys were scattered across the void, becoming the stars in the sky. 

Today, one only needs to look up to see the ring of golden crystal shards orbiting the planet of [[Eberron]]. This ''Ring of Siberys'' is said to be what remains of the Progenitor's body, but myth aside, the Ring of Siberys is the source of Siberys [[dragonshard]]s which fall to Eberron. [[Diviners|divination]] (such as members of the [[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]] [[druid]]ic tradition) also look to the movements of the Ring of Siberys to read omens of the future.
