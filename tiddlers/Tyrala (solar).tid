type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Tyrala is one of thirteen [[solar]]s of the [[Panopticon]] of [[Daanvi]], charged with overseeing the [[plane]] of [[Dal Quor]]. Shortly before the shift of the Dream of the Age that produced [[il-Lashtavar]], Tyrala went to investigate the actions that resulted in [[Dal Quor]] being thrown off its planar axis; she hasn't been seen since.
