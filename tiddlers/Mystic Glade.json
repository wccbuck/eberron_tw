Legend tells that the [[dragon]] [[Vvaraak]]\nonce spread [[druid]]ic teachings from this glade, over\nsixteen thousand years ago. Although not as holy a site\nas [[Vvaraak's Lair]], which lies somewhere in the [[Shadow Marches]], the Mystic Glade still bears the touch of the [[Draconic Prophecy]].\n\nNo one knows the exact location of the Mystic Glade, but\nit likely exists in the [[Shadow Marches]] or the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. Even those who have found the glade before can have difficulty locating it on subsequent visits.\n\nThe Mystic Glade possesses two distinct aspects. As the site of [[Vvaraak]]’s teachings, it retains a special significance for [[Gatekeepers]]. The glade itself is one of nature’s\nbastions; it repels blight and disease and always seems healthy and verdant. [[Druids|druid]] find the glade a peaceful, safe haven in which to meditate or simply retreat from the civilized world.\n\nThe Mystic Glade also plays an important role in the [[Draconic Prophecy]]. It reflects Prophecy marks in every leaf and blade of grass. The [[Chamber]] seeks out the glade for this reason, as does anyone who wishes to decipher and influence the Prophecy. \n\nAre these two aspects related? Some [[Gatekeepers]] theorize that [[Vvaraak]] chose the glade as a teaching place because of its magical qualities. Some wonder if Vvaraak’s actions changed the world so fundamentally that her very presence shaped the Mystic Glade, creating a visual representation of the myriad strings of the Prophecy.",
