        "text": "The headquarters of the [[Wayfinder Foundation]] is a four-story building on Wrogar Street in [[Fairhaven]]. [[Lightning rail|lightning rail]] passengers with a layover often walk to the Foundation Museum, which occupies the first two floors of the headquarters. There, they can view dioramas recreating the exploits of the Foundationâ€™s greatest explorers, hear illusory reproductions of the shrieks and bellows of a [[Xen'drik jungle|Jungles of Xen'drik]] at night, and examine the stuffed figures of [[owlbear]]s, [[displacer beast]]s, [[behir]]s, and more. A course of [[Xen'drik]] jungle branches and vines allows visitors to test their skills at brachiation. Above the museum, the trustees of the Wayfinder Conclave maintain individual offices on the third floor. The fourth floor contains a grand meeting hall and lecture chamber.\n\nThe Wayfinder Conclave manages the affairs of the [[Foundation|Wayfinder Foundation]]. The conclave meets at the Headquarters, and all decisions are resolved by a majority vote. As long as he still lives, Lord [[Boroman ir'Dayne]] has the final say on all expenditures of foundation funds, even overriding decisions of the conclave. Despite his skills, Dayne has been crippled by the wasting curse and rarely leaves the Headquarters. ",
