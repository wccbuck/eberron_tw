title: Dyrrn's tentacle whip
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This long, whip-like strand of tough muscle bears a sharp stinger at one end. To attune to this symbiotic weapon, you wrap the whip around your wrist for up to one hour, during which time the whip painfully embeds its tendrils into your arm.

You gain [[advantage]] to attacks made with this magic whip, but attack rolls made against [[aberration]]s with this weapon have [[disadvantage]]. A creature hit by this weapon experiences strange psychic effects and may find themselves stunned, confused, or filled with terror.

You can sheathe the whip by causing it to retract into your arm, or draw the whip out of your arm again.
