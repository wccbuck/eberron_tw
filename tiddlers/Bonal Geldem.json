        "text": "Provost Bonal Geldem is an elderly scholar of Pre-[[Galifar]] history at [[Morgrave University]]. His work focuses on the activities of House [[Cannith]] in pre-Galifar [[Sharn]], and the recovery of long-lost [[schema]] used by Cannith tinkerers a thousand years ago. He is currently planning an expedition into [[Old Sharn]], a cursed and haunted ruin beneath the city. However, Geldem's greatest danger lies not in the depths, but rather from agents of the [[Lord of Blades]], who seeks to acquire his research on [[warforged]] [[schema]] by any means necessary.",
