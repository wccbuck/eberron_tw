title: Molou cocktail
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Molou|Molou Lassite]] cocktails are thin glass bottles filled with fire rum, with a bit of fabric sealed into the mouth of the bottle with thick red wax. When the fabric is lit on fire and the bottle is thrown, the glass shatters on impact, coating the target in scorching blue flame that cannot be put out by non-magical means. The flame burns for up to 1 minute.
