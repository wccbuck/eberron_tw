However, he is influenced by his need for gold, and his supporters are aggravated by the growing economic gap between [[Middle|Middle Central]] and [[Upper Central]]. His frustration is compounded by the rising success of [[Javan Tomollan]], and every month he becomes increasingly obsessed with Tomollan.
