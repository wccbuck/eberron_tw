A grassy\npark surrounds the open-air amphitheater, allowing audience members to picnic on the lawn if they\nprefer. Once confined to the summer months, its\nperformance season was extended to the whole year\nthanks to the weather-controlling powers of House\n[[Lyrandar]]. Now, audiences can enjoy the warmth\nof a spring or summer day whenever they visit the\nStargazer. Its repertoire focuses on classics with\nfamily appeal. ",
