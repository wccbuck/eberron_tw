''Prerequisite:'' [[Soulknife (talent)]].

Your psychic blades are now more closely linked to your psi-suffused soul. When you cast [[psychic blades]], as long as the spell is still active, you can throw your psychic blade to a point within 60 feet and immediately teleport to that point. The blade then vanishes and the spell effect ends.
