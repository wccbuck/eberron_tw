The [[Eternal Dominion]] city of Hal'syra, built on and around the [[kar'lassa]] tied to the [[plane]] of [[Syrania]], is the center for commerce and
trade with other cultures. Hal’syra even has a rarely-used
quadrant enchanted so surface dwellers can breathe within
it. This city is the source of the [[sahuagin]] ambassadors, envoys, and
merchants who deal with surface dwellers and other cultures,
and it’s here that the scholars of the [[Ta'har]] study surface
dwellers and debate the best ways to deal with them.

The inhabitants of Hal'syra dream in [[Syrania]], the [[plane]] of Absolute Peace; as a result, they are the most conciliatory of the [[sahuagin]].
