The well-beloved //The Changeling's Prophecy//, by the\nancient playwright Duthic Olan, appears on the Grand\nStage's docket every two to three years. This is not the\nplace to see avant-garde productions that wrestle with\nexistential concerns in the wake of the [[Last War]], but\nrather the Grand Stage presents a constant selection\nof the great cultural heritage of [[Galifar]].",
