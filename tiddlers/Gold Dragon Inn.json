Thanks\nto the efforts of House [[Ghallanda]], there's no better\nplace to take a rest than at one of the hundreds of Gold\nDragon Inns that the house operates. \n\nEvery city, most towns, and even some villages have a\nGold Dragon Inn, and a large city might boast several.\nEvery major road through the countryside has Gold\nDragon Inns along much of its length, spaced roughly a\nday's travel apart. Sometimes an inn is the nucleus of a\nsmall community whose industry is focused on providing for the needs of travelers. A few Gold Dragon Inns\nare found in locations that offer no other comforts for\nthe weary traveler—for example, high in a pass through\nthe [[Byeshk Mountains]], deep in the [[Karrnwood]], or beneath the surface of the [[Mror Holds]]. \n\n!! Inn Features and Amenities\n\nEvery Gold Dragon Inn provides a standard menu of\nreliable services at reasonable rates. Prices are fixed, and the quality of services is reliably modest, with some comfortable upgrades available. Every inn uses\none of a small number of possible floor plans, and every\ninn's restaurant offers the same menu, with perhaps a few local variations. The bar always offers the cheap but consistent [[Blink Dog Brew]], as well as the higher-quality Swordtooth Ale.\n\nThe size and number of guest rooms can vary from\ninn to inn: a small roadside inn has four rooms and a\nmoderately sized common room, while a thriving inn in\na large city has forty rooms, a restaurant, and a separate common room, with two stages for entertainment.\nBecause the inns are owned by House [[Ghallanda]], the\nbuildings all include accommodations for [[halfling]]-sized\nguests as well as taller folk.\n\nBecause travelers often carry valuables with them,\neach inn has a heavy strongbox secured with an [[arcane lock]] spell. To make a traveler's stay more enjoyable,\nperhaps even memorable, House [[Ghallanda]] has arranged with House [[Thuranni]] and House [[Phiarlan]] to\nemploy guild-licensed entertainers at almost every Gold\nDragon Inn. \n\n!! Inn Attractions\n\nThe table below offers some ideas for unique\ntwists on an inn's character or atmosphere.\n\n| !<<dr d6>> |!Attraction |\n| 1 |The bartender is a [[changeling]] who is always mimicking the patrons for a laugh. |\n| 2 |The innkeeper is 7 feet tall, claiming to have grown 2 feet after venturing into the mist of the [[Mournland]]. |\n| 3 |Rumor has it that the innkeeper here is a [[gold dragon]] cloaked in a humanoid guise. |\n| 4 |This inn is haunted by a ghost who loves to sit by the fireplace and tell stories—but it has been accused of more sinister activities once the fire burns down to embers and the guests are in their beds. |\n| 5 |The inn has a [[blink dog]] that wanders around with her five pups, all of them eager for attention and treats. |\n| 6 |This inn offers \"the true [[Talenta|Talenta Plains]] experience\"—the [[halfling]] family that runs it keeps pet [[dinosaur]]s. |\n\n!!
