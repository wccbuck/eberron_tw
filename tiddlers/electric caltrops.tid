title: electric caltrops
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

These pyramid-shaped crystal caltrops utilize an arcane technology similar to the one used to create [[lightning rail]] [[conductor stone]]s. When the caltrops are placed in a specific configuration, any creature who moves within 5 feet of them becomes the target of a bolt of deadly electricity. Once these caltrops have discharged in this way, they can't be used again until the next dawn.
