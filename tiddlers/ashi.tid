Ashi is a thick golden flatbread of the [[Shadow Marches]] made from the dried and pounded pith of the ashi reed. In the Shadow Marches (especially in [[Zarash'ak]]), ashi bread is often eaten with honey as part of a luxurious breakfast or folded around roast vegetables, grilled snake meat, and a hot-sour sauce as quick street food.
