King [[Jarot|Jarot ir'Wynarn]]’s fourth child, Wrogar was a huge bear of a man who enjoyed the rugged lifestyle of Aundair’s countryside as much as he loved poring through the libraries and\nother depositories for books of history and religion. When\nJarot died, Wrogar initially supported his sister [[Mishann|Mishann ir'Wynarn]]’s\nclaim to the throne (Mishann ruled [[Cyre]] at the time), but\nthat wasn’t enough to keep the kingdom together. Soon, the\n[[Last War]] touched even distant Aundair, and Wrogar was declared king. He ruled [[Aundair]] until his death in 920 YK.",
