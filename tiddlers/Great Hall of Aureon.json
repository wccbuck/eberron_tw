Scholars, scientists and [[artificer]]s, and any others who seek knowledge have made a practice of spending the night in\nthe Great Hall. They believe that inspiration will\nvisit them while they sleep on the marble floor of the\nmajestic temple. Some of [[Breland]]'s greatest minds\nthrough the ages have claimed that their greatest\nbreakthroughs came after a night in the temple.\nMerrix d'Cannith (the grandfather of the [[current head|Merrix d'Cannith]] of House [[Cannith]] in [[Sharn]]) attributed the invention of living [[construct]]s (the first [[warforged]]) to a stay in the Great Hall of Aureon.\n\nThe Great Hall also provides a place to find\nexperts in all fields. The temple staff represents the\nbroad spectrum of scientific study, and if they do\nnot know the answer to a question they can almost\ncertainly find someone who does. The ordained\nclergy of the Great Hall include experts, [[wizard]]s,\nloremasters, and [[bard]]s, as well as [[cleric]]s, and position in the hierarchy of the temple has nothing to\ndo with field of expertise.
