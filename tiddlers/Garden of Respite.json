        "text": "The Garden of [[Respite]] is a multitiered garden maintained by the [[Healers Guild]]. A sanctuary from [[Stormreach]]’s clamor, the fragrant garden is a favorite place for\nquiet walks and romantic rendezvous.\n\nEach of the garden’s three tiers is home to a different type of plant. The top tier, which sees the most sun, is reserved for flowering plants from [[Xen'drik]] and other\ncontinents. The second tier is used for plants that\nrequire less light and less heat than those in the top\ntier. This means plants and trees from more temperate\nparts of the world. The third and lowest tier harbors\nwinter plants and mushrooms. This is the least-visited\npart of the garden, where garden tools are stored in\nstone sheds that were once tombs, which are rumored\nto connect with the [[Undercity]].",
