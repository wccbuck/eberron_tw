tags: Dura [[upper ward]] ward Sharn
title: Upper Dura
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This ward is full of activity. Its people are prospering,
but there's an edge of desperation about them; many
folk are on the lookout for opportunities to better themselves. Upper Dura has the general properties of a middle ward, with most goods and services priced for a
modest or comfortable lifestyle. The merchants and artisans are accustomed to dealing with unusual individuals, and adventurers receive a warm welcome here.

[[Clifftop]] is a home away from home for explorers and
mercenaries. [[Daggerwatch]] is a fortress district, containing garrisons for the [[Sharn Watch]] and the Brelish army. The [[Gold & White]] is a Daggerwatch tavern that caters
to Brelish soldiers; those who hold a Brelish military
rank will receive a warm welcome, while those who
served other nations would be wise to take their business elsewhere.

In the [[dwarven|dwarf]] district of [[Highhold]], a center of activity is [[Moraggan's]], which serves the strongest spirits in
Sharn, but it's no mere tavern; often patronized by [[Mror|Mror Holds]] merchants and [[Kundarak]] agents, it maintains the highest of standards (with prices to match).

The [[Highwater]] district is home to the wealthiest inhabitants of Dura and is the site of [[Pegasus Spire]], the [[enclave]] of House [[Vadalis]]. The temple district of [[Hope's Peak]] features the [[Citadel of the Sun]], a grand temple of [[Dol Arrah]] and a bastion for the virtuous. The [[Overlook]]
district is home to Sharn's [[kalashtar]] community and
includes the only temple of the [[Path of Light]] in [[Breland]].
