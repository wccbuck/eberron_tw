        "text": "The Three Sisters are a trio of islands in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. They separate the [[Bitter Sea]] from the [[Straits of Orthoss]]. Their individual names are Zhivanaar, Lyritza, and Tashineh.\n\nThe names for these three islands were the names of the daughters of the great pirate lord [[Lhazaar]]. According to legend, Lhazaar wanted her three daughters to settle down in the Principalities and find an island to rule, to help stabilize the new [[human]] colony. But the sisters preferred to sail, and they intended to return to [[Rhiavhaar]] and continue their adventures. And so Lhazaar magically turned their ships into these islands, forcing the three sisters to remain.",
