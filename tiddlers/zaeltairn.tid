As opposed to the civilian [[zaelantar]], the zaeltairn ("warrior souls") of the [[Tairnadal]] are the soldiers who serve in an army and fight the Tairnadal’s endless war, emulating
their [[ancestors|patron ancestor]] in the field. Zaeltairn are split into armies, each of which is further divided into clans and [[band|warband]]s. These assignments and duties aren’t temporary; once assigned to an army, Tairnadal serve until they die or until they retire (or are forced to retire) to train the young. A Tairnadal army effectively functions as a nomadic city-state; most [[patron ancestor]]s were guerrilla soldiers and mobility was vital, thus most Tairnadal armies are nomadic, following migratory paths across the steppes. A few armies remain settled, however, based on the specialties of the ancestors represented by the army. Notably, each of the great jungles of [[North Aerenal]]—around [[Shae Thoridor]] and [[Var-Shalas]]—is home to an army, whose members specialize in jungle warfare and commando operations.
