A portion of the profits returns to the\n[[Daughters of Sora Kell]]; the hags believe that the Roar\nwill raise Droaam’s standing in the eyes of the world.\n\nThe Liondrakes also serve as constables and guards in the [[Calabas]] of [[Graywall]], which also houses the organization's [[headquarters|Tharashk Enclave (Graywall)]], as well in as the [[Tharashk]] headquarters of [[Zarash'ak]].",
