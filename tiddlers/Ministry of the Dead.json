        "text": "The Ministry of the Dead is a government agency in [[Karrnath]] which manages the practice of [[necromancy]] in the nation, as well as the maintenance of Karrnath's [[undead forces|Karrnathi undead]]. The Ministry has the authority to grant warrants to necromancers permitting them to “compel the corpse of any Karrnathi citizen into service.” The Ministry of the Dead also maintains the [[Vaults of the Dead]] in [[Atur]]. Count [[Vedim ir'Omik]] leads the agency.\n\nAfter the signing of the [[Treaty of Thronehold]] that ended the [[Last War]], King [[Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] of [[Karrnath]] withdrew [[undead soldiers|Karrnathi undead]] from his active legions as a gesture of good will in securing the peace. But [[undead]] and the business of making them remain central to [[Karrnath]]’s military strength. Kaius commanded\n[[Count ir'Omik|Vedim ir'Omik]] to maintain operations and readiness should hostilities\nresume, but to keep a low profile. The count follows these orders to the letter, creating and equipping large numbers of [[undead]] soldiers in highly secretive operations in [[Fort Zombie]] and [[Fort Bones]]. The people of [[Vedykar]] and [[Vulyar]] have learned not to ask too many questions about where the bodies of their dead are taken.",
