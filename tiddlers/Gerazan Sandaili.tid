Gerazan Sandaili is a master weaver in [[Nderitese]],
[[Syrkarn]]'s largest settlement. He has lived in Syrkarn
since fleeing [[Riedra]] some fifteen years ago, but unknown
to even those closest to him is the full story of the life
he led there. A secretly practicing [[psion]], Gerazan was
a member of the [[Broken Throne]], studying the mental
techniques of old [[Dor Maleer]]. As a law-abiding [[Riedran|Riedrans]],
Gerazan fully expected to be punished should his gift be
discovered. What he hadn't counted on were agents of
the [[Thousand Eyes]] slaying his wife and child when they
finally came for him.

Gerazan is now part of the Watchâ€”an unofficial organization of Riedran refugees who make it their business to uncover agents of the [[Inspired]] in [[Syrkarn]]'s larger centers.
No stranger enters [[Nderitese]] without passing through the market corner. No stranger leaves the market corner without having come under Gerazan's watchful eye.
