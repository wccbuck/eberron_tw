title: joyous wand of color
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This crystalline, prismatic wand can channel the illustrative intent of its wielder. While holding the wand, you can magically create a stroke of color in the air, allowing you to draw in midair or on any surface the wand touches. The effect is illusory, visibly magical, radiates dim light out to 5 feet, and dissipates after 1 hour.
