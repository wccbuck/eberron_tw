title: charlatan's gloves
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While wearing a pair of charlatan's gloves, you can produce an illusory image that fits in the palm of your hand. The image lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
