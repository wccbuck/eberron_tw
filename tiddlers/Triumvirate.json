This council, composed of a\nrepresentative from each of the major cities of [[Korranberg]],\n[[Trolanport]], and [[Zolanberg]], was founded as an oversight\ncommittee to monitor the behavior of students and patrons\nof the [[Library of Korranberg]]. The powers and duties of the\nTriumvirate slowly expanded to cover the entire nation.\nEach of the three cities has its own Council of Nine, [[gnome]]s\ndrawn from wealthy families who manage local civic concerns. In theory, the cityâ€™s representative to the Triumvirate\nis democratically selected from its council. In practice, the\nprocess is anything but democratic, as secret wars of words\nand blackmail determine power within each council.\n\nThe [[Trust]], the secret order that protects [[Zil|Zilargo]] society, reports directly to the Triumvirate. It has a coordinator in each city who works with the local council. Few realize that the Triumvirate possesses an impressive vault of information concerning political, military, and economic activities that rivals that of the [[Library|Library of Korranberg]], thanks to the work of the Trust.
