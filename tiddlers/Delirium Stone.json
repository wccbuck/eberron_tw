        "text": "At first glance, this object seems fairly simple: a\nstatuette of a coiled [[dragon]], carved from some dark\ncrystal, a little over a foot in height. But the longer\nyou look at it, the stranger and more disturbing it\nseems. Its outlines are blurry, indistinct, as if it is\ndevouring the light around it. It leaves vague\nimpressions, which seem to change by the momentâ€”vicious talons; rows of curved teeth; horns and tusks that change in shape and size with every glance.\nOnly one thing remains constant: the dragon's eyes.\nLiquid and red, they are like pools of pure blood.\nThey seem to see you, pull you in, and threaten to\ndevour your thoughts. It is an effort to tear your gaze\naway.\n\nThe Delirium Stone is a magical artifact with a powerful aura. Spells such as [[identify]] will not reveal its\npurpose, nor will trial and error; its powers are tied to the\nblood and [[aberrant dragonmark]] of the [[Dreambreaker]], and were used during the [[War of the Mark]] to amplify his abilities.",
