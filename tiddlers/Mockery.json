        "text": "[[Dol Arrah]] will show you how to fight with honor, [[Dol Dorn]]\nwill grant you courage, and when you die, at least you'll know\nyou did so bravely and honorably. The Mockery will drag you\nthrough mud and blood, drive you to betray your principles and\nemploy tactics that horrify your allies and enemies alike—but\nat the end of the day, you'll be standing over the corpse of your\nfoe. Which path will you follow?\n\nThose who despise the [[Dark Six]] condemn the Mockery as\na villain, a monster who encourages cruel and treacherous\nbehavior. This can be as simple as ambushing an enemy,\nusing stealth instead of facing them openly. Or it can mean\nslaughtering innocents, torturing your foes, breaking a truce—anything to bring you victory. Those who embrace the path of the Mockery may say that such tactics are the only way to bring down a superior foe. Honor is a luxury for the strong; for those\nwho are weak and oppressed, victory is all that truly matters.\n\nOthers who follow the Mockery assert that the very idea\nof honor in war is delusional. Pain, terror, and death are the\ninevitable results of violence; at least those who follow the\nMockery acknowledge the truth others deny. The assassin\nwho kills without warning, the barbarian who sees mercy as a\nweakness, the pirate who cultivates a terrifying reputation—all\nthese might view the Mockery as an ally. While this can be a\ndark path for a player character to follow, a hero could use the\ntechniques of the Mockery in pursuit of a noble cause. A grim\nvigilante who uses stealth and fear to terrify cowardly criminals\ninto changing their ways could be guided by the Mockery.\n\nAccording to legend, the Mockery was\nonce the brother of [[Dol Dorn]] and [[Dol Arrah]], but\nhe was stripped of his skin and his name (Dol Azur) after betraying them. His symbols include five blood-spattered blades or a flayed [[dragon]].",
