Across the street from the [[House Phiarlan enclave|Phiarlan Enclave (Stormreach)]],
this small magic shop benefits from its association with
the [[house|Phiarlan]]. The shop specializes in theatrical illusions,
signs, scenes, and sounds and mostly caters to the
needs of the wardsâ€™ performers. The shop stocks a few
wondrous items and wands that fit this theme. Panlamin Felwrought, the [[elf]] [[wizard]] proprietor, is particularly noted for her prowess with [[illusion]]s and is much sought after by theater groups.
