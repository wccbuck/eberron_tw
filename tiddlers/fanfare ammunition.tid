A favorite among tricksters, this ammunition is intended to distract rather than wound. When you launch this arrow or bolt at a target, the projectile vanishes and is destroyed on impact, dealing no damage. A noise of your choice erupts from the point of impact, such as the sound of books falling, a dropped coin, or the breaking of glass. You decide the noise and its volume when you fire the ammunition. The sound can be as quiet as a whisper or as loud as a scream. A savvy creature may be able to discern that the sound is an illusion.
