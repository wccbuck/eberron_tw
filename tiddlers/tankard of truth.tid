title: tankard of truth
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When this silver tankard is filled and both you and at least one other creature drink from it within 10 minutes of each other, its enchantment is automatically activated. Each creature which has drunk from the tankard, if they can't resist its magic, can't speak a deliberate lie to any other creature which has drunk from the tankard. The effect lasts until the tankard is empty, or for 10 minutes. The tankard can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
