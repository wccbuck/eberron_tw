Hammersmith’s Inn in [[Stormreach]] is favored by the [[Forgelight]] district’s mercenaries, ex-soldiers, and adventurers. Despite being rough and ready, the inn is hospitable and, like the rest of the district, has a sober atmosphere. Veterans of the [[Last War]] come here to drink away their sorrows and commiserate with friends, and enemies, made during that conflict.
