Xeno'tor the Dawnchild was the leader of the [[Group of Eleven]] city-state known as [[Ukargo]] during the latter millennia of the [[Age of Giants]]. After the [[titan]] became king of Ukargo, Xeno'tor entered the [[Amaranthine City]] of [[Irian]] and approached the [[Dawn Empress]] with a proposition: in exchange for embodying her concepts of progress and growth in the Material Plane, he would live forever to see it come to pass. A mere titan entered Irian, but it was the //Dawnchild// who returnedâ€”a celestial [[warlock]] of unfathomable power. From then on, the Dawnchild was a figure of divinity among the Group of Eleven, flawless and shimmering with the light of creation.

For centuries, the Dawnchild led his people in the shaping of [[Irian]]'s positive energy; the sun titans researched magical healing, grew bountiful gardens, and expanded their city. Later, he and his city were a valuable member within the [[Group of Eleven]]. But eventually, the unchecked expansion of civilization became unsustainable. In the latter years of the [[Golden City|Ukargo]], Xeno'tor traded with the [[Cul'sir Dominion]] for [[elves|elf]] and other lesser mortals to use as test subjects for horrifying blood magic, attempting to grant immortality to the entire titan populace of his city. 

When the [[dragon]]s arrived and began the Shattering of [[Xen'drik]], they could not slay the Dawnchild no matter how many times they cut him down or incinerated him. The great warmages of the [[Light of Siberys]] eventually bound him in a [[demiplane]] of [[Khyber]] after days of battle. His pact with the [[Dawn Empress]] is broken, and thus the titan has lost his immortality; in all likelihood, Xeno'tor's corpse has long ago crumbled to dust within his planar prison. But it is possible that he yet lives, his lifespan having already been extended for a thousand years beyond the present day.
