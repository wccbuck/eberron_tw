Bone knights are [[Karrnath]]i commanders of [[undead]] troops. Clad in distinctive bonecraft armor, these fearsome warriors are trained in [[necromancy]] techniques that allow them to compel the allegience of lesser undead.

Before the development of intelligent [[Karrnathi undead]], the animated soldiers of Karrnath were mindless [[zombie]]s that required guidance. The first bone knights were appointed to provide this control. Devoted [[paladin]]s of the [[Blood of Vol]] were fused into suits of bonecraft armor, whose magic focused their divine gifts, allowing them to command units of mindless undead. Bonecraft armor can't be removed without killing the knight who wears it, and when donning it, each bone knight understood that their former life was over.

During the [[Last War]], many bone knights took service with the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]], helping that name strike fear into the enemies of [[Karrnath]]. In the last decade, King [[Kaius III|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] of Karrnath has done much to ensure a peaceful end to the Last War. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Thronehold]], Kaius sealed most of Karrnath's undead in deep vaults, and the Order of the Emerald Claw was disbanded. A few bone knights remained in service to the crown, but most were cast asideâ€”still bound to their bonecraft armor and still convinced of Karrnathi supremacy. These bone knights felt that Kaius had betrayed both them and their nation, leading their once-proud order to find a new purpose in the service of [[Lady Illmarrow]].
