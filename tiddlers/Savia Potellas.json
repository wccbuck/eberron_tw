She is extremely sharp at business, but she is currently caught in a bind. She has grown tired of paying tribute to the [[Boromar Clan]] and the [[Tyrants]] in order to run her business, but she is afraid to openly move against the powerful crime lords. She could become a valuable ally for adventurers that oppose the Boromars. ",
