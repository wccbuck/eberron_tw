        "text": "In the wake of the [[Mourning]] four years ago, the twisted Greatwenge Embrisa emerged from the depths of the [[Shadow Marches]]. The [[awaken]]ed tree claims [[Vvaraak]] herself charged her with knowledge to\nbe shared only under cataclysmic circumstance.\nHierophants and hermits argue if this event\nis some unknown disaster that lies ahead, the\nMourning, or if she might have been its cause.\nWhile Embrisa hasnâ€™t engaged directly with\n[[Oalian]] or the leaders of the [[Gatekeepers]], a\nsmall conclave of [[druid]]s methodically recruit\npromising aspirants from within the other sects\nto an estuary hidden somewhere between the\n[[Crawling Swamp]] and the [[Deepwood]], called the\nWengeweald, which plays hearth to this ancient\nsentinel and her growing army of disciples. Now,\nwhippoorwills whisper of a tradition forgotten\nmillennia ago, called the Circle of the Arbiter, and\nits followers blaze a trail once consigned to\noblivion.\n\nSeemingly by design, the circle remains\nintimate and its ultimate mission yet to be\nrevealed. If you have been recruited by Embrisa\nand initiated into the mysteries of the Arbiter,\nwhy? Is a massive [[planar|plane]] incursion looming?\nCould the [[Mourning]] spread beyond [[Cyre]]? As an\nArbiter you will like receive assignments directly\nfrom Embrisa or fellow agents, and your true\npurpose will surely emerge in time. \n\n!! Circle of the Arbiter\n\nMembers of the Circle of the Arbiter understand\nthat the material world is just one aspect of\nreality. These planar defenders are sworn to\nprotect the natural world from the denizens and\ninfluence of the outer [[plane]]s. The [[druid]]s of this\ncircle are drawn from many different sects, and\nin this order an [[Ashbound]] stands shoulder to\nshoulder with a [[Greensinger|Greensingers]] as the last bulwark\nbetween Eberron and the beyond. This diversity\nstrengthens the circle, as every tradition offers\nunique advantages and techniques that to\ncounter different threats. ",
