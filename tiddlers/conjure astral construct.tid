title: conjure astral construct
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

By channeling [[psionic|psionics]] metacreativity, you form an "astral [[construct]]" from wisps of raw astral ectoplasm, the residual threads of creation from the [[Astral Sea]]. The astral construct forms within 60 feet, and persists for up to 10 minutes, until your concentration breaks, or until it gets over 120 feet away from you, at which point it dissipates. Until then, the construct obeys your mental commands.

An astral construct generally appears as an animate clump of translucent ectoplasm with a vaguely [[humanoid]] shape, but the manifester can mold or sculpt one according to their whim, of roughly human size. If you build the construct for combat, it has a [[creature tier]] of ''2''. If not, it is creature tier ''1'', and you choose ''two'' of the following special abilities:

* The astral construct's land speed increases from roughly 15 mph to 30 mph.
* The construct has wings and can physically fly up to 15 mph.
* The construct is streamlined and shark-like, and can swim up to 20 mph.
* The construct has an [[advantage]] when attempting to grapple and restrain creatures.
* The construct can cast the spells [[mage hand]] (psionic) and [[force blast]].
* The construct can cast the spells [[lightning lure]] and [[shocking grasp]].
* The construct has [[blindsight]] out to 20 feet.

!! Epic-Tier

When you cast //{{!!title}}// as an epic-[[tier|spell tier]] spell, you may do any of the following:

* As above, but the astral construct can be as large as a horse or an [[ogre]], and you can increase the [[creature tier]] by 1.
* Conjure three astral constructs as above.
* Conjure one [[creature tier]] ''1'' astral construct that can be as large as a horse or an ogre, with ''two'' of the following special properties:
** The astral construct's land speed increases from roughly 15 mph to 50 mph.
** The construct has wings and can physically fly up to 30 mph.
** The construct is streamlined and shark-like, and can swim up to 40 mph.
** The construct can cast two [[uncommon-tier|spell tier]] spells for free. The chosen spells are subject to GM approval.
** The construct can turn invisible at will.
** The construct has [[blindsight]] out to 60 feet.
** Two properties from the rare-tier list.
