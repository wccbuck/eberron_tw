type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

With the help of resident herbalist [[Lyric|Lyric's Herbs and Serums]], the residents
of [[Stillwater Station]] have established a limited system
of agriculture. Lyric has alchemically engineered a
variant of the thornweed plant that grows throughout
the [[Mournland]]. The plants produce a tough, fibrous
material, similar to bamboo, that can be hardened for
use in construction, stripped and braided into rope,
or boiled into a tasteless but nutritious mash.

Residents of Stillwater take turns cultivating and harvesting the thornweed fields south of the station proper. The thornweed fields are also watched over by the [[shifter]] [[cleric]] Sen-Tulchinne, whose resolve to commune once again with the land of [[Cyre]] is matched only by his tenuous grip on reality.
