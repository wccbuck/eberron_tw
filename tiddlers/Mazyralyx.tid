Mazyralyx is the [[prakhutu]] of [[Katashka]] the Gatekeeper, the [[overlord]] who embodies the fear of death and [[undeath|undead]]. An ancient [[white|white dragon]] [[dracolich]] (perhaps the first) with runes carved into his bones, Mazyralyx is believed by some sages to be the origin of many myths of the [[Keeper]] during the [[Age of Demons]]. He dwells within the [[Lair of the Keeper]] in the [[Demon Wastes]]; if adventurers need to bargain for a particular lost soul, they could seek out Mazyralyx there.
