type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While holding this rod, you can attempt to command obedience from each chicken, goat, pig, or sheep that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each such beast must resist your enchantment or be charmed by you for up to 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the beast regards you as its trusted leader, and will not attack you. The rod can't be used in this way again until the next dawn.
