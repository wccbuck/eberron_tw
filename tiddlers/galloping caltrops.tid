type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

After spreading this bag of caltrops on the ground, you can speak a command word and activate them. Each of the caltrops' tines bend and become little legs, and the caltrops follow a creature you choose or the next creature that enters the area. The galloping caltrops can travel up to 5 mph, and can move 3 times before becoming non-magical.
