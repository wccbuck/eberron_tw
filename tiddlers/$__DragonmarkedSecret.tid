''Prerequisite:'' Any non-[[aberrant|aberrant dragonmark]] [[dragonmark]]

My parents suppressed the development of
a tool that would let anyone perform the
primary service my [[dragonmarked house]] is known for. I
believe they killed the [[artificer]] who developed it—and beyond that, I suspect my
parents still have copies of their work and
a prototype hidden in their workshop, even
though they should have destroyed it all.

//What is my parents' position within the dragonmarked house? Do I support my parents’ actions?//

''GM Notes: ''The nature of the suppressed secret depends on
the house. For [[Lyrandar]], it would be an [[airship]]
anyone could fly; for [[Sivis]], it would be a [[speaking stone]] anyone could use. Mass production of this tool would be a tremendous financial blow to the
[[house|dragonmarked house]]. Were the character’s parents acting on
behalf of house leadership, or is the baron in the dark about their actions?
