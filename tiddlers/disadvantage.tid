"Disadvantage" is a term sometimes used to mean "remove one d6 to your dice pool for this [[attempt|Taking Action]]". Disadvantages are granted by some magical effects or items, but should be used sparingly by GMs; typically GMs should allow players to use their full pool of dice, and instead tweak [[risk]] and [[impact]] based on the context of a scene.
