While holding this wooden staff, you can cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of you, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would. You can only do this about 8 or 10 times per day before the staff's magic temporarily fades.
