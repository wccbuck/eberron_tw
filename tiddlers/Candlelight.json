The Candlelight is\none of the best, specializing in Thrane desserts. It has private rooms for customers who have a little spare coin and a desire to discuss things away from curious ears. These\nrooms are often used by Thranes harboring secrets, either\nshameful deeds from the [[Last War]] or heretical beliefs\nthey feel they cannot share with their neighbors.",
