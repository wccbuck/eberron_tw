The inkgill fish is a rare creature found in the [[Thurim Bay]]. Inkgills are typically nearly a meter long, with a dark-colored cylindrical body. Though unpalatable, the fish is valued for the dark, viscous fluid that its gills produce while under stress. Ink from the fish is considered to be of stupendous quality.
