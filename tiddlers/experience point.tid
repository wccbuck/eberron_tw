Experience points (shortened to "XP") are a representation of a [[player character|Character Creation]]'s power potential. Players can spend experience points on two things:

* [[Talent|talent]]s. Most talents cost ''1'' point, but some cost ''2'' or even ''3'' XP.
* ''Proficiency in an [[action or attribute|Actions and Attributes]].'' By spending ''2'' XP, your character can gain proficiency in one more [[action]] or [[attribute]]. The maximum number of proficiencies is five; by default, player characters start with three.

By default, new characters start with ''three'' experience points. Typically player characters will gain 1 XP after completing one or two [[mission|Missions and Downtime]]s (3-5 sessions), and 1 additional XP at the end of each story arc (3-5 missions).
