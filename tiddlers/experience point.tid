Experience points (shortened to "XP") are a representation of a [[player character|Character Creation]]'s power potential. Players can spend experience points on two things:

* ''New [[talent]]s.'' Most talents cost ''1'' point, but some cost ''2'' or even ''3'' XP. You can choose to swap a 1-cost talent with a 2-cost talent when you spend an experience point, such as replacing [[Dilettante Spellcaster]] with [[Spellcaster 2]].
* ''Adding 1 to an [[approach]].'' You can increase one of your approach scores by 1 by spending a number of XP equal to the new score plus 1. So increasing an approach score from 0 to 1 costs ''2'' XP; increasing it from 1 to 2 costs ''3'' XP.

By default, new characters start with ''three'' experience points. At least one of these experience points should be spent on a [[talent]] at [[character creation|Character Creation]]. Typically player characters will gain 1 XP after completing one or two [[mission|Missions and Downtime]]s (3-5 sessions), and 1 additional XP at the end of each story arc (3-5 missions).
