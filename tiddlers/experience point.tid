Experience points (shortened to "XP") are a representation of a [[player character|Character Creation]]'s power potential. Players can spend experience points on two things:

* [[Talent|talent]]s. Most talents cost ''1'' point, but some cost ''2'' or even ''3'' XP.
* [[Action or attribute points|Actions and Attributes]]. Increasing an [[action]] or [[attribute]] score to 1 or 2 costs ''2'' XP. Increasing a score to 3 or 4 costs ''3'' XP.

By default, new characters start with ''three'' experience points. Typically player characters will gain 1 XP after completing one or two [[mission|Missions and Downtime]]s (3-5 sessions), and 1 additional XP at the end of each story arc (3-5 missions).
