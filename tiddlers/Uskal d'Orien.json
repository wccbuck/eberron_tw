        "text": "House [[Orien]] operates in [[Stormreach]] out of quarters in the [[Citadel of the Twelve]], under the capable hand of Uskal d’Orien. Uskal plays many roles; he makes reservations for travelers, sees to the needs of [[Transportation Guild]] members when they are in Stormreach, and represents Orien in diplomatic affairs. Though the years are taking their toll on him, Uskal is a jovial and energetic man, with streaks of red remaining in his white beard and smile lines worn into his cheeks. Uskal has no [[dragonmark]], but he is a capable administrator.\n\nIn addition to his work as a travel agent, Uskal oversees four members of the [[Couriers Guild]]. Three of them make deliveries only within the city. [[Rain d'Orien]] is the exception.",
