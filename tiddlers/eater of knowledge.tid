An eater of knowledge (or //gjarmol horbalva// in [[Dethek]]) is a lumbering, bipedal [[aberration]] which resembles a humanoid heap of squelching muscles, leathery hide, and grasping ganglia, with exposed brain matter oozing from openings in a distended skull. Eaters are ordinarily slow, shambling creatures, but can sprint with surprising speed. They do not speak, but occasionally moan or gurgle when agitated. While physically imposing, these hulks also wield an unpredictable variety of [[psionics]]. 

Eaters of knowledge have been found among the forces of [[Dyrrn]], the Corruptor, beneath the [[Ironroot Mountains]] in the [[Realm Below]]. The creature's name arises from its proclivity to consume the brains of humanoids, as [[mind flayer]]s do, but with a single-mindedness and savage hunger not typically found among illithids. In addition, unlike mind flayers, which overwhelm their foes with [[psionic power|psionics]] before feeding, eaters of knowledge use their physical strength to hold prey while thick, nerve-like feeding tentacles crack free their victims' brains. It is believed that consuming brains fuels the psionic abilities of the eaters, making them deadlier with each brain devoured. Some claim that these rugose abominations collect information from the brains they consume, and then deliver that information to their masters.
