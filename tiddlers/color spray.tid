A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can't see) may be blinded for the next 5-10 seconds by these dancing lights, prioritizing the creatures with the lowest [[creature tier]].
