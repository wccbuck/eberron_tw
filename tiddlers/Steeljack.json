        "text": "Steeljack is the charismatic leader of the [[Iron Watch]] of [[Stormreach]]. He is a deadly\nfighter with a gift for inspiring [[warforged]] and questioning the world around him. During the [[Last War]]\nhe served in the Brelish army alongside [[Smith]] under a commander\nwho despised the warforged, abusing his troops and\nsacrificing them needlessly. After seeing one too many\nof his comrades shattered on the battlefield, Steeljack\ntook his squad, commandeered a boat, and made\nhis way to [[Stormreach]]. In time [[Storm Lord|Storm Lords]] [[Paulo Omaren]], who was looking for a force to counter the [[Amanatus|Amanatu family]]â€™ hold on the [[Stormreach Guard]], contacted him, and so the [[Iron Watch]] was born. Steeljack feels\na debt to Omaren and intends to honor his commitment to Stormreach, but his ultimate interest lies in creating a haven for his people.",
