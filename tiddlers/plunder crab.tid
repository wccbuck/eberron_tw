A common sight in the shipwrecks that cover the seafloor around the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], plunder crabs are attracted to shiny objects, especially jewels and precious metals. The crabs will find these objects and then attach them to their shells with a resin they excrete. The dinner-plate-sized crustaceans have occasionally been known to gather into a mob and attack passing vessels.
