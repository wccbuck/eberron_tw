''Date: '' [[20 Dravago|Khorvaire calendar]]

This spring festival in [[Stormreach]] commemorates
the death of pirate lord Jaldrin Arekarn, whose
descendants would have been among the [[Storm Lords]]
if he had had any. During the city’s beleaguered early
days, Jaldrin turned back assaults both from [[Xen'drik]]’s
interior and from rival captains who sought to seize
the port for themselves. Jaldrin and his beloved, the
dread captain Kilen Razorheart, engaged an entire
armada of pirate vessels in the harbor. They broke the invading fleet but were both mortally wounded by a traitor’s arrow as they embraced in victory. The two
fell overboard, their bodies never found. Now, on the
anniversary of their victory and demise, the citizens
of Stormreach celebrate in their honor, hurling offerings into the sea in the hope that the [[Devourer]] will consume the offerings instead of feasting on the two
captains. Pirate’s Moon is also the festival of love in
[[Stormreach]], a time of blossoming romance.
