Her silvery-gray hair surrounds an unlined face and her eyes still shine bright with the zeal of youth.//\n\nThe Archierophant of [[Sharn]] and the surrounding region, Ythana Morr leads extravagant [[Silver Flame]] services at the [[Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame]]. While many of her clergy and staff simply covet privilege, power, and material wealth, Ythana actively fosters the corruption of her diocese. She secretly cooperates with the [[rakshasa]] [[Zathara]], who lives in the [[Cogs]] district of [[Khyber's Gate]].",
