        "text": "Developed during the [[Last War]] in [[Thrane]], this small order of [[adept]]s and\n[[artificer]]s crafts [[magic item]]s drawing on the power of the [[Silver Flame]]. While it creates magic items of all kinds, the Crucible primarily develops and manufactures weapons powered by [[divine magic]]. These include divine versions of [[blast disk]]s, and [[arcane artillery]] which flings bolts of blinding silver energy; operating a Thranish [[siege staff]] would require entirely different training, as well as a faithful invocation of the Flame. In place of [[breath of Siberys]] as ammunition, some Thranish artillery utilize a special powder literally infused with faith, produced in factory-temples.\n\nThe Crucible also developed the substance known as [[silverburn]].\n\nKeep in mind that the Crucible is a somewhat recent development of wartime innovation and the industrialization of the [[Silver Flame]] faith. Just as there are many devotees of the Flame who disapprove of the theocracy of [[Thrane]], there are many who disapprove of this divine industrialization.",
