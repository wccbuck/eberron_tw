type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You gain a loyal beast companion. Choose a [[beast]] with [[creature tier]] 1, such as a hawk, a mastiff, or a panther. The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. 

If the beast dies, you must take the time to bond with another beast, or swap this [[talent]] for a different one.
