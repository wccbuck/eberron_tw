All mortal creatures have a spiritual connection to [[Shavarath]],
and there's a sliver of their spirit in the [[plane]]. The strength of
this sliver is determined by the mortal's courage, willpower, and
martial drive. Conscripts are [[manifestation]]s formed from this spiritual energy,
but have no awareness and may be formed from multiple slivers;
unlike [[Irian]]'s [[ember]]s, the conscript doesn't resemble the source.
Sometimes, on the death of a great mortal warrior, echoes of
their personality and martial spirit can coalesce into a sword wraith (though its abilities may vary based on the champion it echoes). Unlike standard conscripts, sword wraiths are capable of meaningful action even without the direction of an
[[immortal]] and can command conscripts of their own. A sword
wraith has the appearance of its mortal source and some of
the memories, but it's only an echo of the mortal, much like the
traces of memory that allow you to speak with dead. Sword wraiths reconcile their memories with the war within the layer. If there's a sword wraith of [[Karrn the Conqueror]] commanding troops in [[Nullius Terram]], he believes that he's fighting for
[[Karrnath]] and can't be convinced otherwise; after all, he's only a
memory, and there are limits to his ability to reason.

So adventurers might meet [[Lhazaar]] as she commands a
ship in the [[Bloody Sea]]. [[Dhakaan]]i champions, the [[Mror clan]]
founders, heroes of the [[Last War]]â€”any of these could be found
as sword wraiths, serving the legion that best matches their
values. There are sword wraiths of many [[patron ancestor]]s
of the [[Tairnadal]] elves; however, these aren't the patrons
themselves, simply echoes left behind. While sword wraiths
generally form after a mortal's death, the slivers of especially
remarkable heroes can manifest sword wraiths even while
alive. King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] of [[Breland]] surely has a sword wraith
serving in the Legion of Justice, and it's possible an adventurer
could meet their own sword wraith while exploring [[Shavarath]].
