The guild has been instrumental in expanding the network across [[Khorvaire]], particularly thanks to the efforts of former guildmaster Branthus \"Rooftop\" Corwall ([[half-elf]]), who coordinated operations with the [[Boromar Clan]] of [[Sharn]], the [[Golden Crow]] of [[Thaliost]], and the smugglers of [[Southport|Pylas Maradal]] in what was once Eastern [[Cyre]] before it was claimed by [[Valenar]] in 956.",
