Balewolves are vicious [[monstrosities|monstrosity]] native to the [[Abyssal Forest of Khaar]], a [[demiplane]] of [[Khyber]]. They superficially resemble [[dire wolves|dire wolf]], but have many distinguishing features: most notably, large boar-like tusks that protrude from its lower jaw. Poisonous black sludge drips from their slack mouths, and sometimes covers their entire heads; their beady eyes glow beneath a thick layer of foul-smelling gunk. Spines and thorns sprout from the balewolf's spine, tail, and legs.
