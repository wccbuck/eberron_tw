Ardras d'[[Jorasco]] is a healer stationed in a lonely hamlet near the border of the [[Mournland]]. He follows [[Olladra]] and has been recognized by the local [[liturgical council]] of the [[Sovereign Host]]. One of the farmers who lives near the border recently brought in his son, who had fallen ill after a [[strange gray mist|dead-gray mists]] swirled through the farm. Ardras may ask the player characters to accompany him on a search for a cure for this mysterious ailment.
