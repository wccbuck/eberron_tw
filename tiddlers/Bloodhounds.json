The Wardens have long had a corps of [[awaken]]ed canines—mostly wolves in the [[Towering Wood]], but over the last forty years, they have expanded to include other hounds. Bloodhounds (a term used regardless of breed) generally work with a [[humanoid]] Warden, whether traveling or residing in a community. But occasionally a Bloodhound—or even a team of Bloodhounds—can be found working independently.",
