''Sovereign:'' [[Balinor]]

Part [[wyrm of war]], part [[child of Eberron]], the stalker is a [[draconic|dragon]] [[Sovereign archetype]] who revels in the hunt and their own place in the natural world. Often encountered as ravagers searching for challenging prey, stalkers also serve as scouts in the armies of [[Argonnessen]] and as guardians of the wilds.
