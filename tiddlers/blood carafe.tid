type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This ornate decanter is made from tarnished silver. When it is empty, it will automatically and painlessly fill with the blood of whomever is holding it; this can cause exhaustion and fainting if one is not mindful.

The bottle is sometimes used during [[Blood of Vol]] sacramental rites.
