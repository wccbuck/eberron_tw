        "text": "Prince Oargev ir'Wynarn, son of Queen [[Dannel|Dannel ir'Wynarn]], is the last scion of [[Cyre]]’s ruling family. He was serving as an ambassador to [[Breland]]\nwhen the mysterious [[Mourning]] befell his nation and has\nsince become the unofficial leader of the Cyran refugees\nscattered throughout the other domains. He hopes to one\nday gather all of Cyre’s homeless children to [[New Cyre]], his refuge\nin Breland. His other desire revolves around discovering\nthe truth behind the destruction of his kin and country,\nand exacting revenge on the guilty parties. Until then, he\ngraciously accepts the hospitality of Breland (even if the\nBrelish have given him unwanted land in the middle of\nnowhere) and works to rebuild the confidence and honor\nof his subjects. He serves as mayor of New Cyre while also\nplaying the role of a king in exile.\n\nPrince Oargev regularly seeks out news and information\nfrom those foolish or brave enough to venture into the\n[[Mournland]]. He has been known to fund expeditions into the blasted, wasted remains of his once-proud nation,\nhoping to discover some hint or clue that points to the\ncause of [[Cyre]]’s demise. In the meantime, Oargev works to\nimprove the plight of his people and dreams of rebuilding Cyre—either in a restored Mournland or someplace\nelse entirely.",
