The Free City of Zja Aqat was a [[titan]] city in [[Xen'drik]] during the [[Age of Giants]], and was part of the [[Group of Eleven]] alliance. The city's culture and research focus centered around the [[plane]] of [[Xoriat]] (much to the horror of its allies), using the realm of "inspiration" to perform impossible feats of magic. The structure of the city existed across multiple dimensions and [[demiplane]]s, sprawling endlessly through reality, though its location in the Material Plane was the western sands of the [[Menechtarun Desert]]. To make up for scarce resources of their climate, the metavisionaries of Zja Aqat took resources from other versions of the Material Plane, or perhaps even other timelines. They achieved this through a strange blend of [[psionics]] and [[arcane magic]] inspired by proximity to [[Xoriat]].

The titans of Zja Aqat were so successful in manipulating extradimensional spaces and exploring alternate realities in large part due to their leader, for no matter how far they went, the ''Concateny'' was always with them. The Concateny was one mind made of many, a [[psionic|psionics]] gestalt titan with the power to reshape reality itself. This entity was a massive [[metaconcert]] of desiccated, comatose [[psion]]s bound together in permanent communion. Promising masters of the mind were invited to join the Concateny as a great honor; after they were infected with a sort of psychic parasite, the candidate was inducted into the group, joining the mummified forms of their peers kneeling in prayer in the [[crysteel]] temple deep beneath the city.

In the heyday of the city-state, each [[titan]] of Zja Aqat was connected psionically to the vast overmind beneath their feet, which offered information, advice, and inspiration. To other giants visiting the city, the overwhelming presence of the Concateny looming behind their own consciousness was disturbing, even nauseating; but to the Zja titans, it was a source of comfort and power.

!! Zja Aqat Today

The lost city of Zja Aqat spans multiple [[planar realm]]s—[[layer]]s of [[Xoriat]], [[demiplane]]s (both artificial and "natural" [[Khyber]] demiplanes), the [[Astral Sea]], even the [[moon]]s, all held together by the Concateny and the magic of its travelers from its location in the Material Plane. From a distance, the city is a mirage; sprawling buildings formed from softly glowing [[crysteel]] rise from the desert, some fractured long ago. Above them, entire city districts hover in the air; the city is as vertical as it is horizontal. Twisting currents and portal gateways once carried travelers between the disparate sections of the city, but most of these have been destroyed by either the [[dragon]]s or by the long millennia under the hot [[Menechtarun|Menechtarun Desert]] sun. But it is possible the infinite doors of Zja Aqat can be reopened, allowing transit to impossible places—even other versions of [[Eberron]] trapped in the Maze of Reality, such as the home world of the [[gith]].
