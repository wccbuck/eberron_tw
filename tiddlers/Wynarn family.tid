The royal family of the now fractured kingdom of [[Galifar]], the Wynarns are the descendants of the [[Galifar I|Galifar Wynarn]]. Those of the [[Five Nations]] believe this family to be blessed by [[Aureon]] and chosen to lead the people of [[Khorvaire]]. Following a short but brutal civil war in the seventh century YK, all Wynarn rulers have been [[human]].

Until the start of the [[Last War]], only the line of the monarch of [[Galifar]] kept the Wynarn name; any monarch's child (beside the eldest) who married a local noble would pass their spouse's family name to their children. This tradition was dropped when Galifar fractured, as each of the monarchs of the [[Five Nations]] claimed the name.

Note that the "ir" prefix for [[nobility|Nobility of the Five Nations]] did not come into practice until after the time of Galifar Wynarn and his children.
