Like [[Lanarak]] and [[Londurak]], the mythic founders of Clans
{{!!toldorathname}} and {{!!tordannonname}} were siblings. Unlike their fellow
exiles, Toldorath and Tordannon never quarreled. They followed
the same path, shared the same labors, and even built their
holds adjacent to one another; the city of [[Frosthaven]] lies directly
between the two holds and serves as the capital for both.

{{!!toldorathname}} and {{!!tordannonname}} had many skills, though they were
masters of few. They were hunters and herders, warriors and
miners. But above all, they were the most gifted healers of
the exiles, ready to help anyone in need. Before the [[Great Sorrow|Mror History]],
Frosthaven healers (particularly of the [[Jolnar]] family) were found across the holds. This changed with the arrival of House [[Jorasco]]. Today the finest healers in
the [[Mror Holds]] are [[halfling]]s, but dwarves still serve in the
healing houses. More importantly, the farms of {{!!toldorathname}} and
{{!!tordannonname}} are a primary source of many medicinal herbs and
flowers that drive Jorasco operations across [[Khorvaire]].

At a glance, {{!!toldorathname}} and {{!!tordannonname}} have much in common.
They mine copper and herd mountain [[tribex]] and other [[beast]]s
on the fields south of [[Mirror Lake]]. They're stoic warriors
when they must fight, but they never start a quarrel unless
driven to it. In other ways, they are quite different. {{!!tordannonname}}
dwarves are devoted to the [[Sovereign Host]], while the {{!!toldorathname}}
are ambivalent about religion. {{!!tordannonname}} suffered grievous
losses in the War Below; they shun [[symbiont]]s, have sealed
off their deep passages, and live in fear of the next assault. In
contrast, the {{!!toldorathname}} are intrigued by symbionts and keen to delve deeper into [[Sol Udar|Realm Below]]. Despite these differences, they support one another. Loyalty is one of the prime virtues of these
clans—to family, clan, and the holds themselves.

But there is one thing that makes these two [[Frosthaven]] clans
stand out: their support for the [[Jhorash'tar]] [[orc]]s. A story says an
orc shaman taught the healing arts to {{!!toldorathname}} and {{!!tordannonname}}
in the first days of the Exile. This could be pure fantasy—the
modern Jhorash'tar aren't particularly adept healers—but
regardless, these two clans have always sought peace between
orc and [[dwarf]]. This has brought them into bitter conflict
with Clan [[Droranath]]. There have also been times when the
Frosthaven clans have themselves suffered at the hands of the
orcs, when a tribe has struck a {{!!tordannonname}} spire in retaliation
for perceived treachery. But the clan lords remain committed
to building a bridge between the two peoples. Over the last
century, they have promoted the concept of giving the [[orc]]s a
seat on the [[Iron Council]]. {{!!toldorathname}} has employed Jhorash'tar
mercenaries to help secure its colony in the [[Realm Below]], and
is seeking to expand this force to drive a new offensive.

{{!!toldorathname}} and {{!!tordannonname}} have no specialty that calls out
a specific style of adventurer, but this just means that any
character could come from Frosthaven. They have soldiers and
fighters, hunters and [[ranger]]s. What drives these clans is loyalty
and kindness, their belief that it's always better to make a new
friend than to dismiss someone as an enemy.
