Now it's\nfaded and forgotten, but it still has traces of its\nformer glory. There’s a few gaming tables and\na small stage; there’s a [[dwarf]] comedian who’s\nbeen doing the same act for sixty years. It's known to be under the protection of the [[Boromar Clan]], which makes it one of the safest establishments in [[Lower Dura]].\n\n''Eranna d’Ghallanda'' runs the inn; she’s kind, honest,\nand much beloved in the district.
