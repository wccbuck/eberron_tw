        "text": "In recent months, a number\nof vessels have vanished from what were thought to\nbe safe sea lanes near the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. No\nknown pirates have claimed responsibility, and no\nwreckage has been found.\n\nAt the same time, pirates and merchants have\nreported seeing a bizarre fleet of ships on the horizon\nof the [[Lhazaar Sea]]. The lead vessel appeared to be a\n[[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] warship, but the ships that flanked it were\noddly misshapen. Mysterious colored lightning was\nsaid to dance between the masts of this ghostly fleet.\n\nIn truth, these rumors are connected. For the moment, Captain [[Magwroth]] of the Chaos Fleet seems content to attack and raid lone vessels. However, the ships and crews he destroys are taken under his control, and so the Chaos Fleet has begun to grow, as malign [[elemental]]s possess the crew like zombies and advance the captain's apocalyptic agenda.\n\nThe Chaos Fleet consists of half a dozen to two\ndozen vessels, its numbers changing from day to\nday. Most of the ships, including [[Magwroth]]'s //Devourerâ€™s Hand//,\nare mortal-built wrecks kept afloat by the elemental power that now infuses their waterlogged hulls, and are manned by [[elemental drudge]]s in the shape of their former crews. Their horrid features include eyes of fire, teeth and fingernails of ice, and wounds that bleed mud. The other ships hail from the mysterious [[demiplane]] where the [[drudge|elemental drudge]]s originated, and are driven by the power of fire and air. Though they appear to be roughly carved of rock or ice, these\nchaos ships are impossibly swift and can run down\neven [[elemental galleon]]s.\n\n",
