An almiraj is a timid rabbit-like [[fey]] with a 1-foot-long spiral horn emerging from its forehead, not unlike the horn of a [[unicorn]]. If driven to attack, it tries to spear enemies with its horn. Almiraj live in earthen burrows and can be captured and domesticated. With the GM's permission, the [[summon familiar]] spell can summon an almiraj.
