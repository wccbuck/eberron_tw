Magister and Master of Magic Eera ir'Jalon oversees the team of [[magewright]]s and aspiring [[wizard]]s who keep [[Argonth]] in the air. Operating out of the base of Cannith Tower, Eeraâ€™s corps includes both hirelings from House [[Cannith]] and devoted [[Brelish|Breland]] arcanists. \n\nEera is an exceptional [[transmuter|transmutation]] from a noble family, and is proud to serve her nation, but where [[Quill Carayne]] delights in his job, Eera looks forward to one day returning to her studies and to teaching. In the meantime, she tutors the members of her unit. Her most promising student is an enthusiastic [[warforged]] who has taken the name [[Finias Wandhand]].",
