Empty Handed is a shop in [[Respite]], [[Stormreach]]. Troy Alzander does his best to make sure that nobody leaves his store without buying something; he believes it is bad luck if they leave empty handed. The store has various tools, artworks, and knickknacks (and a small supply of minor [[magic item]]s that Troy will sell if a person knows to ask). If someone is about to leave without buying anything, Troy tries
to sell a cheap [[trinket]] as a last resort.
