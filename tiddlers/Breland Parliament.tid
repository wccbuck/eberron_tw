The parliament of [[Breland]] is a ruling body that governs alongside the nation's monarch. It was established during the Kingdom of [[Galifar]] as a representative body that advised the Prince of Breland. At the outbreak of the [[Last War]], Princess [[Wroann ir'Wynarn]] promised to make [[Breland]] a place where “people would be judged by word and deed instead of social class.” In [[895 YK|Khorvaire calendar]], Wroann granted greater powers to the Parliament, granting it the authority it has today.

[[Breland]]'s parliament consists of both elected legislators and hereditary [[noble|Nobility of the Five Nations]] legislators. The citizens of Breland elect legislators every two years. These elected lawmakers, selected by popular vote (one from designated villages or towns, two from designated cities, and three each from the metropolises of [[Sharn]] and [[Wroat]]), are sent to the capital to serve in the Commons Chamber and participate in all parliamentary proceedings. The noble legislators gain their seats in the parliament based on the status of their families; each of the ten dukes of [[Breland]] serve as a Lord Parliament, along with members of specially appointed noble families selected by King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] to serve for a limited number of years. Each year, the recognized head of an appointed family appoints a family member to parliamentary duty. In many cases, the yearly appointment is symbolic, and each family has one representative who serves year in and year out. Forty-four noble families are chosen to serve; in addition to the ten dukes, this makes fifty-four Lords Parliament of the Nobles Chamber.

The Parliament has the authority to create laws, as well as to conduct business related to foreign affairs and national security. It usually works in concert with the [[crown|Boranel ir'Wynarn]], who enforces the laws, but the two branches of authority have disagreed and even clashed on occasion. One noble in particular, Lord [[Ruken ir'Clarn]], doesn't want to see the monarchy continue after [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]]'s death. He and a few trusted conspirators seek to remove the crown's authority with the passing of Boranel,
thereby giving all ruling power to the parliament. The parliament, in turn, would elect a prime minister to preside over the council and the nation. Ruken envisions himself initially filling that role.
