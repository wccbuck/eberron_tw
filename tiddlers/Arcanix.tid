''Population:'' <<ntls>>

This farming village on [[Lake Galifar]] provides food for
the nearby floating towers of wizardry that serve as
home to [[Aundair]]'s [[Arcane Congress]]â€”a cutting-edge
research facility and the finest school of magic in [[Khorvaire]]. Most people reach the towers by magical
means; for others, the village rents [[hippogriff]]s to bear
visitors to the fortresses for a modest fee; this service is provided by the Trannick family, headed by the Lord Mayor of Arcanix, [[Raulo ir'Trannick]].

The three floating towers of Arcanix (Glarehold, Amberwall, and Skyreach) hover above [[Lake Galifar]], unmoving and untroubled by wind or rain. Their labyrinthine corridors house
mentors and students who explore the mysteries of magic as they have since the great institution was founded nearly 1,000 years ago. They also advise Aundair's [[queen|Aurala ir'Wynarn]] on all things magical, and confer with colleagues
visiting from other nations.

The floating castles contain classrooms and laboratories, cells for students, and apartments for mentors. Great libraries (such as the [[Library of Robideur]]) hold the collected lore of generations,
with rituals and spells bound in dusty tomes. Hidden vaults contain great treasures and dangerous items, some unearthed by adventuring wizards (such as the great [[Gate of Xabra]]), others created by the mighty mages who have lived here.

Apprentices come from all over [[Khorvaire]] to train at
Arcanix. If you're a [[wizard]], sage, or [[artificer]], you might
have learned your craft here.
