Local law decrees that nothing native\nto [[Aundair]] can be sold within the Distant Exchange.\nPeople visit here to purchase foreign goods and\nrarities, as well as to meet unusual folk.\n\nClose to the embassies near [[Fairhold]] and several bustling districts, the Distant Exchange is also a trading place for information. More than one merchant is loyal to a foreign interest, and agents can talk within the exchange under the guise of doing business.",
