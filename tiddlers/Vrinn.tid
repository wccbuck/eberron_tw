Vrinn is a [[changeling]] burglar in [[Sharn]]. Vrinn worked a short stint with the [[Tyrants]] before betraying his accomplices and abandoning a job, bringing a great deal of heat on the syndicate. His former employees see Vrinn's inside knowledge as a liability and relentlessly hunt the [[changeling]].

In his preferred form, Vrinn prefers a one-eyed cycloptic visage, and on occasion he claims (falsely) to be descended from an ancient [[cyclopean|cyclops]] civilization of [[Xen'drik]]. He is a fan of conspiracy theories, and will regale any listener with tales of how the [[elves|elf]] were actually the oppressors of the [[ancient giants|Age of Giants]], and that [[dragon]]s don't actually exist.
