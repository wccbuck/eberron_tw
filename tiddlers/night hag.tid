Night hags are among the first children of [[Khyber]], and roamed [[Eberron]] freely during the [[Age of Demons]] when the [[overlord]]s ruled the Material Plane. Some sages believe night hags originated in a [[demiplane]] of Khyber called the [[First Night]] (also called the Covenant), perhaps created for a specific purpose, independent of the overlords. After the overlords were defeated and bound, the night hags were scattered, each pursuing their own agenda.

Resembling a humanoid crone with [[troll]]-like features, blue-purple skin, and black hair, night hags are terrifying creatures to behold. Legend has it that all other [[hag]]s are the children or grandchildren of the [[immortal]] night hags.

Today, night hags are a rare sight, but can be found in the [[Demon Wastes]] (like the "ambassador" [[Kyrale]]) or [[Droaam]], or wandering the [[plane]]s. Amazingly, night hags are the only known creature that can freely enter and leave [[Dal Quor]], the Region of Dreams, and can haunt the dreams of mortals, harvesting emotions and memories. In order to pass into Dal Quor, a night hag must have a [[heartstone]] in her possession.

Night hags are also responsible for the creation of fiery steeds known as [[nightmare]]s.

!! Origin of the Night Hags

Thirteen hags emerged in the [[First Night]], old from their first moment; they were called grandmothers even before the first mortal was born. Twelve of these night hags were bound in covens of three; even then, [[Sora Kell]] made her own path. Most [[fiend]]s are tied to one of the dread [[overlord]]s, and it would be easy to think that the first hags were children of [[Sul Khatesh]], given their affinity for both secrets and magic. But there is no overlord in the First Night. Rather, it seems that the twelve and one collectively embody an idea. Many fiends embody concepts that mortals fear, and the simplest answer is that the night hags embody mortal fears of the night—both specifically of nightmares, but also of the unknown forces lurking in the darkness. 

The accounts of [[Jhazaal Dhakaan]] add a twist to this, suggesting that the night hags embody the curiosity of [[Khyber]] itself. Jhazaal observes that the night hags should be considered [[fiend]]s, as they will lead mortals into despair and doom without remorse. But she notes that the hags lack the greater malevolence of the [[overlord]]s, that they have no desire to dominate mortals or the world; instead, they love to watch stories unfold, especially stories that end in tragedy. 

In the [[first days of the world|Age of Demons]], the night hags served as intermediaries between mortals, [[fiend]]s, and the other great powers of reality. They took no sides in the many wars of that time, finding joy in moving stories along and watching the horrors that unfolded; they had no agenda, for this story needed no finger on the scales to tilt it toward disaster. The hags simply loved being in the midst of the chaos, and reveled in turning the pages of history.

Should we accept these stories, a night hag is many things at once. She is a shaper of nightmares, who takes joy in hand-crafting nocturnal visions so terrifying that a mortal might fear to ever sleep again. She is an ancient being who may have spoken with [[dragon]]s, [[demon]]s, and even [[overlord]]s. And above all, she is a creature who delights in watching stories unfold and in seeing //what happens next//—especially when those tales end in tragedy.

!! Fragments of Ghazra

What of the curious spectrum between night hags? How can we reconcile the legend of [[Sora Kell]] shattering an army with the tale of Ola the Smith outwrestling Sora Tenya? How can we account for the fact that a catalogue of night hags produces more than thirteen names? The answer may be found in another Dhakaani account. The [[dirge singer]] Uula Korkala blamed the hag ''Sora Ghazra'' for the tragedy that befell her city, and rallied the greatest champions of the age to her pursuit of vengeance. She worked with the legendary hunter Ur’taarka to track the hag and to create snares that could bind even the greatest of [[fiend]]s. She worked with the [[daashor|artificer]]s to enchant the chain of the mighty Guul’daask, creating a weapon that would shatter the hag’s spirit even as it crushed her bones. Korkala took her vengeance, and Sora Ghazra was defeated. 

But it is no simple thing to kill an [[immortal]]. The shards of Ghazra’s shattered spirit embedded themselves in her killers. Ur’taarka, Guul’daask, even Korkala herself—all were haunted by nightmares. Unable to sleep, they wasted away in body and mind. Eventually the magic of this curse reshaped them into hags—lesser versions of the primal crone they’d destroyed. This created a line of night hags, each bearing this curse. When any one of them dies, the killers will be consumed by nightmares. The curse grows weaker with each generation, and there are heroes who have survived this gauntlet of nightmares; but any who are broken by these terrors will become a weaker hag. Thus, should you encounter a night hag who seems not to live up to the terrifying legend of [[Sora Kell]], she is likely one of Ghazra’s line; the threat she poses will depend on how far removed she is from her ancestor.
