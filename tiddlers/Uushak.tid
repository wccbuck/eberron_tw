Uushak, the Carrion King, is a great [[fiend]] of the [[Wild Heart]]. Uushak embodies the concept of the beast in the shadows waiting to feast on your corpse, to find you at your weakest and to strip all that remains. It often takes the form of a vulture, a hyena, a crow, or even a worm. Uushak's domain is the grisly aftermath of battle, famine, or pestilenceâ€”rot, bone, broken blades, and despair. It is worshipped by the [[Carrion Tribe|Carrion Tribes]] known as the [[Carnage Hounds]].

Unlike the [[Wild Heart]], Uushak is not bound by the [[Silver Flame]], and wanders freely within the [[Demon Wastes]]. Typically, it remains only partially manifested, appearing as a swarm of crows or as three feral [[gnoll]]s, speaking through a rotting corpse, or channeling through a Carnage Hound champion.
