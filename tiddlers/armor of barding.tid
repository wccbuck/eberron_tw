This suit of full plate [[armor]] is decorated with gold inlay. When the wearer is mounted on a creature no larger than a warhorse, they can speak the armor's command word to cause the plates of the armor to expand and reposition to protect the wearer's mount. In this form, the armor's protectiveness drops from "heavy" to "medium", but applies to both wearer and mount. This armor can even create exotic barding to cover non-horse mounts such as [[griffon]]s. A second command word merges the armor back into its standard full plate form.
