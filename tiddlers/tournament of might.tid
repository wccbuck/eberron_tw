type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Every week in the [[Harbor]] district in [[Stormreach]], the [[Wavecrest Tavern]] holds its famed arm wrestling tournament, drawing contestants from across
the city to test their strength. Winners receive [[1 c|money]]
and free drinks for the rest of the evening.

!! Arm Wrestling at the Wavecrest

Arm wrestlers sit at a wooden table, their hands
strapped together (to prevent slipping). Before the
match begins, the arm wrestlers can attempt to intimidate their opponent while the referee, a grubby [[goblin]] named Granks, straps their hands. On Granks’s mark, the contest begins. The victor is the first one to slam their opponent’s hand down on the table.

Any PC entering the competition faces the following competitors in turn.

# ''Bredoln Laranak:'' This hulking [[dwarf]] is broader in the shoulders than he is tall. Hailing from the [[Mror Holds]], Bredoln finds the wild atmosphere of [[Stormreach]] more to his liking. He is a master of intimidating the opposition with a cold hard stare and a practiced facial twitch. After the match, his stony face immediately softens and he laughs heartily, even buying the PC a drink whether he won or lost.
# ''Quinton Debly:'' An unlikely competitor in the contest, Quinton, a [[gnome]], fools most of his opponents because of his short stature. He removes his robe before the match, revealing a heavily muscled frame that puts most [[human]]s to shame. His faith in [[Dol Dorn]] makes him especially skilled in contests of strength. Before the match, he prays, enhancing his strength using a burst of [[divine magic]]. If Quinton wins, he immediately leaps onto the table, flexing his biceps for the roaring crowd.
# ''Goragga:'' A laborer in [[Graystone]], Goragga is remarkably clever and charismatic for an [[ogre]]. She joined the [[Tharashk]] workforce out of a desire to see distant lands and enjoys meeting newcomers in taverns. She studies her opponents over the course of an evening; she can enter a barbarian rage only once per day, and wants to be sure to save it for her most able challenger.
