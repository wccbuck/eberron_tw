Anyone who wants to enter the [[foreign quarter|Jhodra]] must pass through a customs inspection. [[Clairsentience|psion]] is used to detect magic, and inspectors confiscate any [[magic item]]s that has an aura of the [[conjuration]], [[enchantment]], [[evocation]], or [[necromancy]] school; confiscated items can be reclaimed upon departure.\n\nThe customs inspection is relatively brief, however,\ncompared to the interrogation process required to gain a\ntransit visa beyond the [[Jhodra]]. The visitor is questioned\nabout their reasons for coming to [[Riedra]], their occupation,\nand whether they are carrying dangerous goods or has any\ncriminal intent. A typical customs agent specializes in sensing motives of those they question.",
