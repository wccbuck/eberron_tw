Moar'donn, a [[black|black dragon]] [[rogue dragon]] in [[Khorvaire]], hatched in a [[Poison Dusk]] [[lizardfolk]] encampment in [[Q'barra]]; how the reptilians acquired his egg, the dragon doesn’t know. Unlike their more civilized cousins in the [[Cold Sun Federation]], these savage lizardfolk enslaved and tormented the black wyrmling. In time, Moar’donn grew powerful enough to escape from his captors. Now only bitterness and rage lives in his heart. He ruthlessly destroys all nondragons who cross his path.
