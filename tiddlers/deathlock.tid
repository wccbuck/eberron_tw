The forging of a pact between a [[warlock]] and the [[Keeper of Secrets|Sul Khatesh]] is no minor occasionâ€”at least not for the warlock. The consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in some cases, lethal. A warlock who fails to live up to a bargain with [[Sul Khatesh]] runs the risk of rising from the dead as a deathlock, a foul [[undead]] driven to serve its otherworldly patron from beyond the grave.
