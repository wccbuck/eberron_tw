The forging of a pact between a [[warlock]] and a patron is no minor occasionâ€”at least not for the warlock. The consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in some cases, lethal. A warlock who fails to live up to a bargain with a [[Mabar]]an patron runs the risk of rising from the dead as a deathlock, a foul [[undead]] driven to serve its otherworldly patron from beyond the grave.

An extraordinarily powerful [[necromancer|necromancy]] might also discover the dark methods of creating a deathlock and then bind it to service, acting in this respect as the deathlock's patron.
