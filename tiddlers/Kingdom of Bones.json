        "text": "Where the domain of the [[Amaranthine City]] of [[Mabar]] feels like an empire\nin its last days, the Kingdom of Bones is one that's already\nfallen. If a [[layer]] contains a fortress, it's not preparing for a\nfinal battle; it's what remained after the battle. The gates are\nshattered, and bloodstains and broken weapons are scattered\nacross the floors. The people of this domain fought a dreadful\nwar and lost... but this being Mabar, their bones remain. The\nskeletons of peasants continue their menial labors, seemingly\noblivious to the futility of their actions. Even in death, these\ncommoners are oppressed by their cruel lords. [[Wight|wight]]s,\n[[deathlock]]s, and [[vampire]] spawn might serve as the soldiers of\nthe tyrants, while the overlords themselves may be vampires or\nmummies, still ruling from their ruined keeps.\n\nAll of the kingdom's cursed nobles bow before the [[Bone King]],\nwho embodies the concepts of death and decay.",
