You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet and that can hear you (and that aren't immune to being charmed) to focus intently on you. The target creatures may try to resist your enchantment; if you or your companions are fighting a creature, they have [[advantage]] to their attempt to resist. If a creature fails to resist your magic, it is enthralled by you, and it has [[disadvantage]] on attempts made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends (after 1 minute) or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak.
