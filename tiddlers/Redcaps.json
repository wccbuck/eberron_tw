        "text": "Inspired by stories of the [[fey]] of the [[same name|redcap]],\nthis gang is made up of [[goblin]]s and [[kobold]]s, and\nit operates out of [[Little Graywall]]. For thousands of\nyears, the smaller races have been oppressed by\nlarger, more powerful creatures. The Redcaps are\ndedicated to taking vengeance for these indignities.\nThey enjoy ambushing [[ogre]]s and [[troll]]s on general principle, but specifically target anyone who abuses\ngoblins or kobolds, whether they are locals or foreigners. So far they have not provoked a response from the\n[[Flayer Guard]], but this could be a matter of time.\n\nThe Redcaps are drawn from multiple tribes. They operate in secret, hiding behind masks and their blood-soaked red caps. The group is led by ''Gurb Bonecrow'', a talented [[goblin]] [[wizard]] who calls himself “the Raven” when masked; his chief lieutenant is the [[kobold]] ''Reka the Razor'', who is especially deadly with a blade.",
