Hezcalipa was a [[couatl]] sage during the [[Age of Demons]] who, along with the [[dragon]] [[Ourelonastrix]], discovered the [[Draconic Prophecy]] and used it to combat the [[overlord]]s. Hezcalipa eventually led the other [[couatl]] in their sacrifice to kindle the foundation of the [[Silver Flame]] to bind the overlords and empower mortals to fight [[fiend]]s for ages to come.
