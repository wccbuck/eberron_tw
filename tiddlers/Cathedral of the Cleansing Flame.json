The Archierophant of\nthe region, [[Ythana Morr]], helps foster this corruption, while many of the\nclergy and other staff simply covet privilege, power,\nand material wealth. The Archierophant, however,\nactively cooperates with the [[rakshasa]] [[Zathara]], who\nlives in the [[Cogs]] district of [[Khyber's Gate]].",
