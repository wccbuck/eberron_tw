        "text": "The Dagger Span is a massive and heavily-traveled bridge which connects the two banks of the [[Dagger River]] near the city of [[Galethspyre]], [[Breland]]. At thirty miles long, it is the longest bridge in [[Khorvaire]] and the only bridge over the Greater Dagger. The Span is an astounding work of engineering, and its foundations were built thousands of years ago by the [[Kech Draal]] during the Empire of [[Dhakaan]]. Other Dhakaani bridges once spanned the Dagger River, but have since collapsed into ruin; the most recent collapse occurred 1,500 years ago at the hand of [[Halas Tarkanan]].\n\nThe engineers of the [[Five Nations]] don't fully understand the materials or techniques used by the [[Dhakaan]]i to construct the bridge, but they have built upon the existing structure of the Dagger Span, enhancing it as an [[Orien trade road|Orien trade roads]] and attaching a [[lightning rail]] line.\n\nA small toll town sits on either side of the bridge.
