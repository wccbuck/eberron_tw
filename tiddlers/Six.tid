Six is the top investigator of [[Sharn]]'s [[Guardians of the Gate]]. She is a [[changeling]] who spends much of her time in [[Lower Tavick's Landing]]; she maintains half a dozen different personas as she monitors events. Some of the other Guardians distrust her because of her race, but her talents have proven invaluable.
