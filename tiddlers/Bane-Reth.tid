Bane-Reth, a [[gold|gold dragon]] [[rogue dragon]] in [[Xen'drik]], is evil to the core and enjoys torturing lesser creatures and murdering their families as they watch. He was banished to [[Xen'drik]] after going on a killing spree through the [[Vast]], slaughtering dozens of younger [[dragon]]s. Bane-Reth claimed these dragons dishonored their race by consorting with inferior beings, but his actions were condemned by the [[Eyes of Chronepsis]]. Although unquestionably evil, he hates the [[Talons of Tiamat]] as much as he detests lesser creatures, seeing dragons who throw their lot in with [[fiend]]s as the worst kind of traitors. Bane-Reth is engaged in a territorial dispute with [[Vrakor Cinderheart]]. He could be an ally to PCs who oppose the [[fiend]]-loving [[red dragon]], albeit an unreliable one.
