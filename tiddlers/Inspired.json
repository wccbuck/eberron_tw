        "text": "The rulers of distant [[Sarlona]] are known as the Inspired. These noble families are said to be bound to celestial spirits that guide and empower them, but the truth is far\ndarker. The Inspired are the mortal hosts of the nightmare spirits of [[Dal Quor]], and they carry out the foul\nagenda of the [[Dreaming Dark]].\n\nAny [[humanoid]] who can dream can volunteer to serve\nas a [[quori]] vessel. But the Inspired of [[Sarlona]] are [[human]]s bred with traces of [[elf]] and [[fiend]] blood to be such vessels. These vessels (known as the [[Chosen]] before possession) have no choice in this destiny, since they can't resist quori possession.\nPhysically, Inspired resemble the [[kalashtar]], possessing\nan almost supernatural beauty.\n\nMost of the people of the [[Five Nations]] have heard\nof the Inspired lords in [[Riedra]]â€”never realizing that\nInspired are spread throughout [[Khorvaire]] as well.\nBeggars and generals, mayors and merchants might\nall be secret servants of the [[Dreaming Dark]]. Such individuals have to willingly accept [[quori]] possession, but the Dreaming Dark has long experience in weaving dreams\nthat can convince mortals to surrender their bodies. ",
