This sword is forged of the finest steel, with powdered red Eberron [[dragonshard]] carefully inlaid into intricate designs along the blade. When you strike a living creature with this blade, you may suffer 1 [[stress]] to deal additional [[necrotic damage|damage type]] to the target, and accelerate the healing of your own wounds (low-[[impact]] [[magical healing]]), as you siphon the life force from the creature.
