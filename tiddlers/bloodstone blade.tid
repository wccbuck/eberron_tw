This sword is forged of the finest steel, with powdered red Eberron [[dragonshard]] carefully inlaid into intricate designs along the blade. When you strike a living creature with this blade, you may suffer 1 [[stress]] to deal additional necrotic damage to the target, and accelerate the healing of your own wounds, as you siphon the life force from the creature.
