Cold fire is a form of [[continual flame]] that occurs naturally in [[Fernia]]; the flames have the texture of warm putty.

An artificial form of cold fire was developed by the legendary [[artificer]] Casalon d'[[Cannith]] in the third century YK (though some claim the [[elves|elf]] of [[Aerenal]] first achieved this a thousand years prior).
