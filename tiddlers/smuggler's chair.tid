title: smuggler's chair
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This item appears to be a simple wooden chair, but close
inspection reveals a hidden compartment when the seat is
lifted. The hidden compartment fills the space between the
chair legs and is concealed by an illusion that makes it
appear empty. The compartment has a volume of 1 cubic
foot.
