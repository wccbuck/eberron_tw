!! Watch Promises Extra Patrols for Long Shadows

[[SHARN|Sharn]]—The city will be well protected against criminals during the upcoming nights of the [[Long Shadows]] (Vult 26th through 28th), according to Lord Commander [[Iyan ir'Talan]]. "The [[Sharn Watch]] remains vigilant throughout the year, and Long Shadows is no exception," asserted ir'Talan on Sar. "City residents can take comfort in knowing that they're safe in their homes with the Watch on guard."

Commander ir'Talan said patrols would be increased by one-quarter during [[Long Shadows]] nights. Furthermore, the [[Daggerwatch Garrison]] plans to augment patrols in the [[Dura]] quarter by one-half.

"I'd like to commend my watch commanders for the success of last year's Shadows at Bay operation, during which the [[Watch|Sharn Watch]] arrested more than two thousand criminals during [[Long Shadows]]," [[ir'Talan|Iyan ir'Talan]] said. "And I can promise an even safer city this year."

But [[Councillor|Sharn Council]] [[Sava Kharisa]] maintains that the high number of arrests during Long Shadows last year is evidence of failure, not success. "In the [[Lower Central]] district, armed gangs ran wild and took over the streets at night," she said. "Where was the Watch? Locked behind the doors of the garrisons. For every arrest the Watch officers made, two other criminals ran through the streets of [[Sharn]] unimpeded."

Kharisa also pointed out that some of the high-profile crimes from last year's Long Shadows—including the ritual murders at Bluebrick Spire—still remain unsolved a year later.

Commander [[ir'Talan|Iyan ir'Talan]] said that while agents of the [[Blackened Book]] would doubtless be active throughout [[Long Shadows]], few arrests have historically been made for crimes involving the supernatural. "Long Shadows carries with it a lot of superstition, and events such as the Bluebrick Spire case feed on that kind of hysteria," he said. "But garden-variety criminals are using Long Shadows as an excuse for their own nefarious activities—it's not a case of monsters running amok."

The [[Sharn Inquisitive]] plans a special report on Long Shadows unrest in a later issue.

!! Prince Oargev Slams Slow Pace of Cyran Rebuilding

[[NEW CYRE|New Cyre]]—The [[Brelish Parliament|Breland Parliament]] is dragging its heels on better roads and other improvements that would make life easier for thousands of [[Cyran|Cyre]] refugees in eastern [[Breland]], said Prince [[Oargev ir'Wynarn]], last heir to the fallen nation.

“Each day, [[Cyre]]’s children come home to [[New Cyre]], and we greet them with muddy, nigh-impassible roads. Monsters from the [[Mournland]] continue to menace our settlements. But some do-nothings in [[Parliament|Breland Parliament]] won’t loosen the purse-strings and give a generous welcome to those set adrift by war,” he said.

The population of [[New Cyre]] and environs has swelled from a few dozen farmers to a teeming community of nearly twenty-two thousand since the end of the [[Last War]]. Most residents are former Cyrans who were beyond the nation’s borders on the Day of [[Mourning]].

The population influx has strained eastern [[Breland]]’s resources, ir’Wynarn said. Specifically, the roads are in poor condition and border patrols are spread too thin to keep the refugees safe.

“These are brave people who lost everything in the [[Last War]], and they just want a chance to raise their families and build a new future,” he said. “But we literally can’t get lumber wagons down the roads so they can build new homes for themselves and their children. Bandits are roaming the countryside preying on those who have little enough to begin with.”

A levy of additional soldiers for the Eastern Command languishes in committee, ir’Wynarn said. Road improvements slated for this past summer were delayed by minister’s order and won’t be reconsidered until spring.

But Laruna ir’Panalric, who represents the Brey Crossing region in Parliament, said that [[New Cyre]]’s growing pains are competing with other priorities for Parliament, including a general postwar rebuilding effort and continuing efforts to secure the [[Breland]]’s western border. She accused [[Oargev ir'Wynarn]] of exploiting sympathy for the plight of the refugees for political gain.

“The Day of [[Mourning]] was a tragedy for all of [[Khorvaire]], and I’m proud of how [[Breland]] has opened its arms to former citizens of [[Cyre]]. I wish other nations shared Breland’s generous spirit,” she said.

“But [[Breland]] is trying to make its way in a new world—a peaceful one with an empty [[Galifar]]an throne. Oargev can’t expect us to reconstitute [[Cyre]] within our own borders. This is Breland, and it always will be,” she said.

Laruna ir’Panalric is a sponsor of proposed legislation that would limit the number of Cyrans living in eastern Breland. Told of her comments, [[Oargev ir'Wynarn]] said that Eastern Breland was being ill-served by some of its parliament members.

“Sadly, there are a few, in Parliament and elsewhere, who can’t accept that the Last War is over and still want to do battle with [[Cyre]]. To them I say: Do your worst—we survived the Day of [[Mourning]], and we’ll survive your petty prejudice."

!! Countess ir’Hilyark Flees Wedding; Whereabouts Unknown

[[FAIRHAVEN|Fairhaven]]—The Hilyark family is searching for Countess Kehrlique ir’Hilyark, who disappeared from the family compound in [[Fairhaven]] on Zol, the eve of her wedding.

The bride’s father, Jarran ir’Hilyark, pleaded for information about his daughter’s whereabouts.

“I know everyone thinks this is a case of ‘cold feet,’ but my daughter has been looking forward to this day for years,” he said. “Tongues are wagging about this, but I ask you to remember that this girl has a mother worried sick about her. She has a six-year-old brother who wants to search every house in [[Fairhaven]], tears in his eyes.”

“Please, if you know where my daughter is, tell us. We only want to know that she’s safe,” he said.

Because Kehrlique attended [[Morgrave University]] in [[Sharn]] and has many friends in the city, she may have traveled to [[Breland]], Jarran ir’Hilyark said.

Vandrich d’Orien, ir’Hilyark’s fiancé, has promised House [[Orien]]’s assistance in making sure his bride is found safe.

House Orien agents are interviewing everyone involved with the wedding but keeping a low profile, guests said.

“It’s a bit awkward to have the groom’s family hunting for the bride,” one prominent wedding guest said on condition of anonymity. “On the one hand, of course they should help. On the other hand, maybe the bride doesn’t want to be found by the groom.”

The postponed wedding marks another blow to the fortunes of the Hilyark family. Last month, the Hilyarks lost a land dispute covering thousands of acres of prime vineyards between [[Passage]] and [[Bluevine]]. Kehrlique ir’Hilyark’s maternal uncle, Corso ir’Hilyark, was among the passengers on the //Blue Malia//, sunk this summer in [[Scions Sound]]. And a Hilyark-financed bridge over the [[Aundair River]] northeast of [[Fairhaven]], intended as a gift to the crown, has had work halted several times due to cost overruns.

Also missing from the Hilyark compound are Nendra Bachain, a Hilyark family servant, and Macham Turrisaud, Kerlique ir’Hilyark’s bodyguard.
