Their academic knowledge is superior to that of many of their colleagues, and they are known as an excellent lecturer, but their lack of significant field experience has held them back. Word is circulating that they plan a truly ambitious expedition to the far south of [[Xen'drik]], which will almost certainly either make or break their career.",
