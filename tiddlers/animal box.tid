title: animal box
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This box is made from rough wooden planks. Holes have been drilled into the sides; the box occasionally rocks and emits a terrible growl, as if a feral animal is trapped inside.

Despite the sounds, the box is entirely empty. It simply emits frightening sounds to discourage anyone from opening it.
