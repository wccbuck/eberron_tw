Lady Illmarrow is a legend—an ancient [[lich]] said to dwell in a castle of bone and ice in the coldest regions of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. Some stories say that she is served by a legion of [[undead]] and that she maintains a court of [[vampire]]s and [[ghost]]s in her palace of ice. Other tales claim that when anyone dies in Lhazaar, Illmarrow chooses whether to take their soul before it passes on to the [[Keeper]] and [[Dolurrh]].

But Lady Illmarrow is no folk tale. She is the greatest [[necromancer|necromancy]] in [[Eberron]], and after centuries of silence, she is setting ancient plots into motion at last. She is the power behind the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]], but her motives for founding the order are buried in her past. Lady Illmarrow has no interest in ruling the living. Rather, she seeks to become Queen of Death.

!! The Mark of Death

Illmarrow is a fiefdom on the isle of [[Farlnen]]—home to a community of elves exiled from [[Aerenal]], who have practiced [[necromancy]] for centuries. This domain includes [[Port Cairn]], the seat of the [[Bloodsails]]. But Lady Illmarrow's roots extend far beyond her island domain.

Long ago, it was revealed that the [[elven|elf]] [[line|Aereni noble line]] of [[Vol]]—a house that practiced the art of necromancy and bore the [[Dragonmark|dragonmark]] of [[Death|Mark of Death]]—was engaged in secret blood rites with a clan of [[dragon]]s. The discovery of this pact triggered an unprecedented alliance between the [[Sibling Kings]] of [[Aerenal]] and the dragons of [[Argonnessen]]. The Sibling Kings proclaimed that House Vol would be exterminated to the last member, and the [[Mark of Death]] would be eliminated from the world.

The line of Vol had long been rivals of the [[Undying Court]], and many whisper even today that the attack on House Vol was nothing more than an excuse to eliminate a political rival. But others believe that what the Undying Court truly feared was a path shown in the [[Draconic Prophecy]]—that a child born of [[dragon]] and [[elf]] could become a godlike avatar of death.

!! Illmarrow Rises

Even as dragons and elves fought to destroy the line of [[Vol]], a child was born to the house: Erandis. A scion of [[elf]] and [[dragon]], Erandis bore a Mark of Death unlike any other. In time, it might have been her gateway to immortality and unrivaled power, but she was hunted down and killed long before she could master the mark's magic. Her mother, [[Minara Vol|Queen of All Tears]], escaped with her daughter's body to the icy reaches of [[Farlnen]], far from the conflict. There, Minara unleashed all her necromantic power to raise Erandis as a [[lich]].

As an [[undead]] being, Erandis lost the use of her [[dragonmark]]. Thus, when the [[diviners|divination]] of [[Aerenal]] asked if the line of Vol had been exterminated and the Mark of Death destroyed, they received a vision affirming that the bloodline of Vol was no more. To the world, Lady Illmarrow is merely a mysterious [[lich]] of the [[Grim Lords]] of [[Farlnen]]. But in truth, she is Erandis Vol, the last "survivor" of that cursed bloodline, heir to the [[Mark of Death]].

When Minara restored Erandis as a lich, she hid her daughter's phylactery, weaving enchantments into it that cause Erandis to be reborn in a random safe haven after she is destroyed. Thus, even Erandis herself doesn't know the location or form of her phylactery.

!! Restoring the Mark

Though she takes great pleasure in fighting the dragons and elves who destroyed her ancestors, Lady Illmarrow has a more important goal: restoring her [[dragonmark]] and unlocking godlike powers. The agents of the [[Emerald Claw]] who serve her fight either for the good of [[Karrnath]] or for personal gain, but Illmarrow cares for nothing except increasing her necromantic knowledge and finding a way to restore her lost mark.

!! Lady Illmarrow and the Blood of Vol

The [[Blood of Vol]] and Lady Illmarrow are both legacies of the line of [[Vol]], but they aren't one and the same. As far as the world knows, the line of Vol was exterminated. Followers of the Blood of Vol who have heard of Lady Illmarrow believe that she's a champion of their faith, but they don't worship or serve her. And the powers of priests of the Blood of Vol don't come from Lady Illmarrow.
