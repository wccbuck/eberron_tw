Tuura Dhakaan is the leader of the [[Kech Volaar]] and one of the mightiest [[dirge singer]]s of the age. She is one of the few "[[Keepers of the Empire|Heirs of Dhakaan]]" who has revealed themselves to the world. However, like the [[Kech Shaarat]], the Volaar have concealed their true history and power. Tuura has sent [[dirge singer]]s to travel among the [[Ghaal'dar]] sharing stories, helping to educate them about their glorious past and the traditions of [[muut and atcha]]; this ties to Tuura's hopes that the “[[goblin]]s” can be redeemed and drawn back to their past glory. Tuura is determined to claim the throne of the Emperor Yet to Come; she hopes to find the strength needed to compel the Kech Shaarat through reclaiming powerful artifacts and building allies.

The artifacts Tuura is especially keen to find include: [[Ur'taash]], the First Crown; [[Guulen]], the Rod of Kings; and [[Ghaal'duur]], the horn of [[Jhazaal Dhakaan]]. Ur'taash is currently in the possession of the [[Kech Ghaalrac]], though she questions its authenticity. The whereabouts of Guulen and Ghaal'duur remain unknown. Beyond this, Tuura is evaluating the modern world, working to see if others could be useful allies. So while the [[Kech Shaarat]] remain convinced that this conflict is solely based on dominance within the dar, the [[Kech Volaar]] believe that knowledge of the modern world is vital to any long-term success.

Tuura believes that the [[Kech Ghaalrac]] isn’t what it claims to be. Because this clan fought [[Dyrrn]] the Corruptor for thousands of years, she believes that it has been subverted by the [[daelkyr]]—and that [[Khaas]] is simply building an empire on Dyrrn’s behalf. Most of the Kech Ghaalrac forces are still in [[Khyber]]; do they include armies of [[dolgaunt]]s and [[dolgrim]]s? If this is true, it must be because of the coercive power of what Khaas claims to be the [[First Crown|Ur'taash]]—it’s not just Khaas’s reputation that’s winning followers, it’s dark magic. The crown must be destroyed, Tuura believes, if [[Khaas]] is to be stopped.
