A master deceiver, his title comes from his ability to convince others to break their oaths. He is not a force of warâ€”he corrupts the innocent, using ambition, jealousy, and paranoia as his tools. Like [[Sul Khatesh]], Eldrantulku's release might initially go unnoticed; he would drift into the background, causing princes and [[dragonmarked house]]s to turn on one another.\n\nEldrantulku's [[prakhutu]] among the [[Lords of Dust]] is [[Neabaz]], the \"Voice of Chaos.\" He is also served by the exiled [[Mabar]]an [[succubus|incubus/succubus]] [[Thelestes]], the [[rakshasa]] [[Lorishto]], and the [[pit fiend]] [[Bethageh]]. His heart [[demiplane]] is known as the [[Sprawl]].",
