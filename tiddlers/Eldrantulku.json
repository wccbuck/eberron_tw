        "text": "Eldrantulku is a spirit of discord who turns allies into enemies and lovers into mortal foes. A master deceiver, his title comes from his ability to convince others to break their oaths. He is not a force of warâ€”he corrupts the innocent, using ambition, jealousy, and paranoia as his tools. Like [[Sul Khatesh]], Eldrantulku's release might initially go unnoticed; he would drift into the background, causing princes and [[dragonmarked house]]s to turn on one another.\n\nEldrantulku's //prakhutu// (speaker) among the [[Lords of Dust]] is [[Kashtarhak]], the \"Voice of Chaos\".",
