title: Jaunt
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Jaunt is one of the few [[eladrin]] in House [[Orien]], a child of explorers who fell in love with [[Eberron]] and chose to abandon [[Shae Loralyndar]] two
centuries ago. Jaunt is one of the most respected
[[wizard]]s in the [[First Step]]; she is fascinated by teleportation, and has been exploring traditional ritual magic, her [[human]] housematesâ€™ [[Mark of Passage]],
and her own fey abilities in her quest to unlock
greater secrets. She is brilliant, but overconfident and
impetuous.
