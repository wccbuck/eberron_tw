Maurezhi are contagion incarnate. Their bite can drain a victim's sense of self. If this affliction is allowed to go far enough, the victim is infected with an unholy hunger for flesh that overpowers their personality and transforms them into a [[ghoul]]. Sometimes maurezhi are found on the Material Plane leading packs of ghouls and ghasts.

When a maurezhi consumes the corpse of a [[humanoid]] it has slain—a process that takes about 10 minutes—it instantly assumes the creature's appearance as it was in life. The new appearance begins to rot away over the next few days, eventually revealing the [[demon]]'s original form.
