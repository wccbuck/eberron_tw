This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 of its charges and cause plants in a 30-foot radius, centered on yourself, to sway as if in the wind.

The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge,  the [[consequence]] of a [[failed roll|bad outcome]] or [[partial success]] may result in the wand crumbling to ashes.
