title: Riedran Consulate (Stormreach)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A short walk from the [[Wavecrest Tavern]], the [[Riedra]]n consulate is home to the [[Inspired]] consul, Lord [[Katanavash]], his assistant [[Hope|Hope (changeling)]], and the rest of his staff. Most [[Riedran|Riedrans]] sailors see [[Stormreach]] as proof of all the horrible stories about humans beyond Riedra and prefer to remain on their ships when in port. Merchants stay at the consulate for the minimum time required to transfer their goods; they leave the business of trading to the consul and his staff.
