After drinking this foul potion, your appearance changes to become slightly more catlike, with blue-black fur like that of the [[displacer beast]]. Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you, and creatures who attempt to attack you must do so at a [[disadvantage]]. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, as with [[blindsight]], or can see through illusions, as with [[truesight]]. The effect ends immediately if you suffer damage or perform a hostile action. Otherwise, the effect lasts for 30 minutes.
