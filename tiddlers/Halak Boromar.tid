type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Halak Boromar is the family's chief enforcer. The [[Boromar Clan]] still exists in the [[Talenta Plains]], and Halak is a recent immigrant. As a result, he has more of a taste for blood than his city-bred kinfolk, and he likes nothing better than tracking and killing [[Daask]] [[goblin]]s and [[gnoll]]s. He is illiterate and not the brightest [[halfling]] at the best of times, but he is quick, strong, and surprisingly deadly. Halak commands the Clawfoots, the family's personal guard; there are 15 Clawfoot warriors, all of whom are fierce halfling [[barbarian]]s.
