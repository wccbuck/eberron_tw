Yarkuun Draal is a [[Dhakaan]]i ruin on the southern shores of [[Breland]], overlooking the [[Redcliff Bay]]. It was once a great city and thriving port of the Empire of Dhakaan, built into a natural gorge. Today, it lies in ruinsâ€”but it is far from dead. Gardens and lush palms decorate the city's many airy walkways and balconies, but they are all poisonous or carnivorous, and twisted [[plant creature]]s slither through the streets. These gardens are maintained by a powerful entity known as ''Bhodex'av'gr'', an ancient and evolved cultist of the [[daelkyr]] [[Avassh]].
