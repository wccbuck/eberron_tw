The tribes of the [[Shadow Marches]] who follow ancient [[Cults of the Dragon Below]] possess widely varying beliefs. Some tribal warriors embrace madness as a path to strength, wielding rage as others use swords. Others among the tribes are born with supernatural powersâ€”dark gifts that reflect the touch of the [[daelkyr]] so many generations ago. These gifted children often become religious leaders, with whole tribes hanging onto every word of their //jhorkaanta// (old [[Orcish]] for "blood sage"). The source of these sages' power may be [[divine|divine magic]] in nature, or may draw from the lingering influence of the [[daelkyr]] and their own tribe's crazed cabalistic fervor. The beliefs and goals of a Dragon Below tribe often shift with each new generation, making these groups chaotic and unpredictable.
