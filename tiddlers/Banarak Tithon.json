He has a thick mustache and a neatly trimmed beard. The symbol of the Citadel hangs on a heavy gold chain around his neck, and a greatsword rests at his side.//\n\nThe [[Sharn]] commander of the [[King's Citadel]] is Knight-Marshal Banarak Tithon, renowned as one of the deadliest swordsmen in the kingdom of [[Breland]]. Tithonâ€™s wife and children were killed by an [[Aundair]]ian mystical assault near the end of the [[Last War]], and his service to the [[Crown|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] is all that he has left. Banarak has a good heart, but he is increasingly distant and distracted, and leaves more and more of the daily work in the hands of his subordinates.\n\nReporting directly to Tithon are:\n\n* Captain [[Talleon Haliar Tonan]] of the [[King's Dark Lanterns]]\n* Lieutenant [[Eld ir'Zarna]] of the [[King's Swords]]\n* Lieutenant [[Zaira Dane]] of the [[King's Wands]]",
