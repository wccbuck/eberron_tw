        "text": "The Queen of All Tears, a [[Dark Power]] of [[Mabar]], is an embodiment of misery,\nand her subjects are largely incorporeal [[undead]], [[shadow]]s and\n[[wraith]]s from the barren sand. Meanwhile, cruel [[specter]]s and [[banshee]]s attend the Queen, along with [[succubi and incubi|incubus/succubus]] who\nbask in the delicious misery that suffuses the region. The Queen\nherself takes the form of a mummified corpse, enshrouded by a\nspectral image of a beautiful [[elf]] woman. The suffering of others\nis her mead, and her only pleasure is the slow torment of the\nhostages in her [[Hinterland|Hinterlands]] fragments.\n\nThe Queen of All Tears is one of the youngest of the Dark\nPowers. She was once a mortal who dreamed of mastering life\nand death, but her pursuit of these goals resulted in the deaths\nof everyone she ever loved and everyone who shared her blood.\nHer kingdom was razed, and she killed her own daughter\nand transformed her into a [[lich]], so at least one piece of her\nlegacy might survive. Her name was Minara Vol, and she was\nthe mother of [[Erandis Vol|Lady Illmarrow]]. In the process of becoming a [[Dark Power]], she's lost much of her own identity and sense of her\npast. She despises both [[elves|elf]] and [[dragon]]s, but has forgotten\neven her own daughter. If the Queen were to somehow regain\nher memories, she might seek to strike at the [[Undying Court]]\nand [[Argonnessen]], or to aid Erandisâ€”or it may be that she\ncontinues to dwell in her despair and ignore her past.",
