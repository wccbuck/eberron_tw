        "text": "Like the [[Azure Gateway]], the Cloud Dragon is an upscale,\nelegant restaurant with breathtaking views, but without the crowds and long waits typical of the [[Celestial Vista]] Restaurant. Its menu concentrates on the best of [[Brelish|Breland]] [[fare|Culture of Breland]]—spicy ginger soup, sautéed garlic beef, curried chicken, and the like. In contrast to the secretive owner of the Azure Gateway restaurant, the owner of the Cloud Dragon ([[Kathya Morn]]) is very forthright about her identity, making sure to meet and greet every customer and ensure that everyone has an enjoyable dining experience.",
