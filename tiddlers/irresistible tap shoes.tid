While you dance while wearing these tap shoes, you can cast the spells [[charm]] and [[irresistible dance]].

These shoes are [[cursed]] and becoming attuned to it
extends the curse to you. You are unwilling to part
with the item, and when you hear music you must
dance until the music stops or you fall unconscious.
