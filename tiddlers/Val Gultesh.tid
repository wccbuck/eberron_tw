Many [[overlord]]s embody something that is feared; Val Gultesh feeds on fear itself. It thrives on paranoia and on lives torn apart by unfounded fears, and crafts nightmares that help spread terrifying and disruptive ideas. While it can shape nightmares, it does so from [[Eberron]]—effectively, using a powerful form of the [[dream]] spell that can potentially affect hundreds of people at once—as opposed to entering [[Dal Quor]]. The [[quori]] of the present age haven’t encountered an unbound Val Gultesh; it’s quite possible the overlord would pose a threat to them, especially to quori manifesting in Eberron as [[Inspired]] or [[kalashtar]].

Val Gultesh is imprisoned somewhere in [[Zilargo]], and it’s possible that, should its power grow, it could corrupt the [[Trust]] to serve its purposes; however, the Trust could be aware of this threat, and may have ruthlessly eliminated cults of Val Gultesh in the past.
