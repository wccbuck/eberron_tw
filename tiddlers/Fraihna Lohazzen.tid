//"Big country, Syrkarn. Lot of places for someone to hide. Just not from me.//

Fraihna is the best tracker in the steppes of [[Syrkarn]]â€”hard to find and
expensive to hire, but well worth both effort and price.
A lifetime in the wild has burned his leathery skin to the
color of a Syrkarn sunset, and his distinctive shock of
bleached hair is often the first indication of his approach
across the plains. Fraihna roams at an easy pace between
the farmsteads of the [[Lamecha]] Lowlands and
the clanholds of the [[Marrah|Mae-Kree]]. Messages can be passed to
him through any of the veteran drovers of the trade roads,
and such are usually returned within the month.

It's possible that Fraihna (and his enhanced hunting hound, Creysaa) could be an adversary of the PCs, hired to track them for an enemy or rival group. The
[[eneko]] [[ranger]] cares more about survival and his reputation
than about the moral particulars of a given situation.
