''Population:'' <<ntls>>

Dor Maleer shares a border with the [[Tashana Tundra]]—a
border that has been slowly shifting north over the centuries. Prior to the [[Sundering]], Dor Maleer was a loose federation of clans of many races, including [[Akiak]] [[dwarves|dwarf]],
[[Qiku]] [[shifter]]s, and [[ogre]]s. During the Unification, the [[human]]s and [[shifter]]s of the region were absorbed into the [[Riedra]]n alliance, but the [[dwarf]] population was virtually exterminated in the [[Night of Razor Dreams]].

Dor Maleer is the Riedran frontier, and its people
are not as fanatical as their counterparts in many of the
southern provinces. Maleeri are more tolerant of nonhumans than most [[Riedrans]], though [[dwarves|dwarf]] typically receive an unfriendly reaction. Although they perform
what agriculture they can in the harsh mountainous environment, the
Maleeri are primarily hunters, and they respect such
skills. Traditionally, anyone who brings meat to a Maleeri
village is invited to stay and join in the meal.

!! Wild Zones of Dor Maleer

The plains of Dor Maleer lack the resources to support large settlements, and its inhabitants have always lived in small communities, splitting and forming new clans when the population began to outstrip local resources. Dor Maleer contains multiple [[wild zone]]s and [[manifest zone]]s tied to [[Lamannia]], but rather than enhancing the fertility of plants and animals like many other Lamannian zones, these regions embody the more destructive aspects of nature. These include deadly storms, frigid tundras, raging volcanos, and more. The plains of Dor Maleer are broken up by regions of environmental extremes at odds with the surroundings. Wild zones could cause endless hurricanes, with free-roaming air [[elemental]]s howling with the winds. There are vast pools of lava in the Maleeri plains, and fire elementals occasionally emerge to scorch the soil. There are also a few [[wild zone]]s where the environment is more welcoming—a stretch of dense forest, an impossibly verdant valley. Maleeri hunters forage and hunt in these regions, but attempting to settle them is unwise. These zones exemplify the indomitable force of the wild, and resist the intrusion of civilization. Disease, accelerated decay, and hostile wildlife will all plague any would-be settlers. In addition, these regions produce megafauna, massive beasts similar to [[roc]]s in size and power, though they can take many forms. These powerful [[beast]]s are sterile outside their zones, and thus haven't spread. But there are tales of ancient hunters feeding a village for a month with the corpse of a mighty bear dragged from the deep forest. These wild zones cannot be tamed, but there are a few manifest zones with less extreme effects, and these were the sites of Dor Maleer's largest communities before the [[Sundering]].  

The mountains of Dor Maleer contain [[wild zone]]s tied to [[Risia]] and [[Dolurrh]]. In the Risia zones, chasms are filled with ice and temperatures are far more severe than nature should allow. But the ice of Risia preserves, and time ceases to flow for creatures or objects encased in ice in such a zone. It's possible explorers could find ancient champions from the [[Sundering]] or the days of the old kingdoms—or even a frozen [[dragon]] from the [[Age of Demons]]! The influence of [[Dolurrh]] is unpredictable. The most dramatic landmark in the [[Frostwall Mountains]] is the ''Final Passage''. When the moon [[Aryth]] is full, those who venture into this cavern can enter the [[Catacombs]] of Dolurrh. This offers a way to recover a soul that cannot be resurrected through normal means. But the Catacombs have guardians, and the [[Queen of the Dead]] doesn't surrender her subjects easily. 

!! The Old Kingdom

In the days before the [[Sundering]], the [[Paqaa Mountains]] were claimed by the [[Akiak]] [[dwarves|dwarf]], while the harsh plains and cold deserts were claimed by the //Hual Maleer//, a loose confederation of [[human]] and [[shifter]] clans.

!!! The Fall of Dol Maleer

Dor Maleer was never a strongly united nation. The first step for the [[Dreaming Dark]] was to build a force among the //Hual Maleer//—causing tensions between clans and between [[human]] and [[shifter]]. [[Inspired]] champions arose within the clans, uniting them and spreading the word of the Path of Unity. The [[psychic|psionics]] [[Akiak]] proved resistant to the manipulations of the Dreaming Dark, but the [[quori]] amplified fear and conflict between them and the people of the lowlands. As the [[Unity]] of [[Riedra]] emerged, the first true [[Inspired]] offered peace to the Akiak, and paid them handsomely for their aid in creating the [[hanbalani|hanbalani alta]] and other elements of Riedran infrastructure. But once the [[dwarves|dwarf]] had served their purpose, Riedra turned on them—launching a [[brutal preemptive strike|Night of Razor Dreams]]. Survivors were driven from their mountain home and into the [[Tashana Tundra]].
