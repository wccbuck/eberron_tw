title: feather token
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This small metal disk is inscribed with the image of a feather, and enchanted with a [[feather fall]] effect. When you fall at least 20 feet while the token is on your person, you descend 10 feet per second and take no damage from falling. The token's magic is expended after you land, whereupon the disk becomes nonmagical.
