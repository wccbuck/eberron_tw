It is an elite core of [[abjurers|abjuration]] and\n[[diviners|divination]], charged with investigating and containing\nmagical threats. These [[wizard]]s are highly dedicated\nto their work and their city, and generally don't take\nbribes. It's up to the higher-ups, however, to decide what\nmissions to assign to the Blackened Book; if there's a\ncase that a noble doesn't want investigated, it probably won't be.\n\nLady Warden [[Maira ir'Talan]] leads the Blackened Book.",
