They believe that by using its power as they do, they keep the hungry spirits from venturing further afield to prey on innocents. Some Tolashcara are drawn to pursue [[undead]] threats elsewhere in the Plains or in the world, and a small group of Tolashcara [[halfling]]s patrol the edge of the [[Boneyard]] in the [[Blade Desert]] hoping to keep the dead quiet.
