        "text": "The Tolashcara, sometimes referred to as the “Keepers of Bones that Rustle and Moan,” are a [[halfling]] tribe of the [[Talenta Plains]] who guard a [[manifest zone]] to [[Dolurrh]] in the northern plains and draw on its power to [[bargain with the dead|speak with dead]] and soothe restless [[ghost]]s. They are skilled in dispelling hauntings and other hostile gatherings of [[undead]] spirits unable to pass beyond the [[Gateway|Dolurrh]]. Some Tolashcara are drawn to pursue undead threats elsewhere in the Plains or in the world, and a small group of Tolashcara [[halfling]]s patrol the edge of the [[Boneyard]] in the [[Blade Desert]] hoping to keep the dead quiet. \n\nLike the magic of the [[Maskweavers]], the unique system of [[necromantic|necromancy]] [[primal magic]] wielded by the Tolashcara is closely tied to the spirits of the [[Talenta Plains]] themselves, and it typically ceases to function outside of that realm. Only exceptional Tolashcara halflings are able to maintain their connection to the spirits of Talenta while traveling abroad.",
