A House [[Lyrandar]] galleon, also called an elemental
galleon, resembles a Lyrandar [[airship]] except that it has
a [[water elemental]] ring that propels it across oceans and
seas instead of through the air. This vessel has a speed
of 10 miles per hour but otherwise is similar to a Lyrandar airship.
