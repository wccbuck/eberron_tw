        "text": "A [[Darguun]] mercenary troop known as the Va'khor (a [[Goblin]] word translating to “Blackbloods”) uses the [[Bloodstone Inn]] in [[Malleon's Gate]] as a base of operations. The [[hobgoblin]] war leader, [[Margaash]], is not a merchant, and he generally relies on House [[Deneith]] to negotiate contracts on his behalf. However, for the right price, he may be willing to provide information or even a [[goblin]] guide to help a party traveling to [[Darguun]]. Margaash only respects strength; fighters get better results than [[wizard]]s.",
