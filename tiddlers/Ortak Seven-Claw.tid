Ortak Seven-Claw is a [[silver|silver dragon]] [[rogue dragon]] in [[Khorvaire]]. Some say Ortak suffered a head injury in his youth, others that he came from poor stock. Whatever the cause, Ortak displays a lower level of intelligence than most of his peers, and politics annoy and frustrate him. Ortak retired to [[Khorvaire]] so that he could live out his life hunting, fighting, and gorging himself.
