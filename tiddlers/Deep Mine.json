This mine extracts pure platinum from veins more than a mile below the surface.\nClan Mroranonâ€™s smiths make ingots of the platinum\nbullion, which House Kundarak uses as internal currency when transferring wealth from a Kundarak bank to a national government or to another Kundarak\nbank. Security is omnipresent, both to prevent theft by\nsurface dwellers and because the miners sometimes\ndisturb monsters from the depths of [[Khyber]].",
