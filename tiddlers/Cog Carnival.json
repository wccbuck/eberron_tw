        "text": "The Cog Carnival is a dive bar in [[High Walls]], [[Lower Tavick's Landing]], [[Sharn]] which is frequented by [[warforged]]. Just about any resident can give directions to the bar, as it is the only warforged bar in High Walls.\n\nThe bar has a crumbling stone facade marred with graffiti such as \"Forged are Scrap!\" and \"Leave, Metalheads!\" ''Ingot'', a [[warforged]] bouncer with a carved chunk of wood replacing a severed foot, collects a cover fee from those who wish to enterâ€”though warforged get in for free.\n\nInside, smoky, low flames in a fireplace barely illuminate the cracked stone walls and filthy floor of this establishment. The single-room space is crowded with [[warforged]] with severed digits or limbs, scars, burns, and other wounds. Other warforged in the area are gathered around traditional dice, card, dart, and board games as well as carnival competitions such as throwing metal rings onto posts, tossing a ball at a tower of weighted iron cups hard enough to make them fall down, and striking a homemade machine hard enough with a hammer to make it ring a bell.\n\nA small bar in the corner serves cheap ale. Behind this bar, a warforged bartender shouts jeers at patrons losing games. The bartender, ''Smelt'', is also the owner of the Cog Carnival. She wanted to create a safe place where [[warforged]] could gather and socialize in this district. She can't afford the city's expensive gambling license, so she made the Cog Carnival a place where warforged can play games for free.",
