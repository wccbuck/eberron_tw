The family had been healers for generations before the arrival of the [[dragonmarked house]]s, but couldn't match the healing capabilities of House [[Jorasco]]. Over time, the Jolnar shifted their focus to cultivating medicinal herbs and other supplies needed by Jorasco. They are still devoted to the health of others, but theyâ€™ve found a way to work with Jorasco instead of directly competing with the house.",
