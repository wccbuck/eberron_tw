Halas Martain is a member of the [[Wayfinder Foundation]].
While he is quite intelligent and erudite, he is an unscrupulous individual who has no compunctions about using
treachery and deception to steal the accomplishments of
others. Despite his faults, he knows more about [[Xen'drik]]
than many sages, and he has contacts among groups of
[[drow]] and [[giant]]s. Recently, he has been approached by
agents of the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]]; there are artifacts that [[Lady Illmarrow]] herself wishes to recover from Xenâ€™drik, and
Halas may be the man for the job.

Halas comes from [[Aundair]], but little is known about
his past. He has a dark secret: He is the child of forbidden love between members of House [[Lyrandar]] and House [[Phiarlan]], and possesses an [[aberrant dragonmark]] ([[pass without trace]]). He was banished from House Lyrandar and ordered never
to return; this has fueled his anger and desire for personal fame. Halas can be charming when he wants to, but when dealing with other explorers he tends to be condescending and demeaning. He constantly boasts of his own achievements and belittles those of his competitors, taking particular joy in mentioning finds that he has stolen from other explorers.

Halas sells his services to others, and as a result he can
be found working for the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]], the
[[Aurum]], the [[Dreaming Dark]], or some other group.

Halas Martain despises combat. He dislikes
armor and wears a sword more as a point of style than
anything else. He prefers to let others do his fighting for
him, and uses his exceptional skill with diplomacy to gain
the assistance of local toughs.
