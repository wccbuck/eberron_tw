type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This large city in [[Riedra]] is the seat of the [[Edgewalkers]]. Dar Mun is located
between four separate [[wild zone]]s; two are tied to [[Shavarath]], one to [[Daanvi]] (the site of the ancient imperial capital of [[Nulakar]]), and one to [[Dolurrh]] (the [[Imperial Crypt]]). Despite the "Dar" prefix, meaning "Port", the city
is an inland community; the [[Riedrans]] view it as a "world port."

In addition to holding garrisons and training facilities for
Edgewalkers, Dar Mun has one of the
finest arcane libraries and workshops
in [[Riedra]]. A permanent psionic [[teleportation circle]] links the [[bastion|bastion city]] to [[Durat Tal]]. The [[Inspired]] conduct most of their planar research in Dar Mun, and PCs could be sent to steal data from the bastion or to sabotage an [[eldritch machine]] being
constructed there.
