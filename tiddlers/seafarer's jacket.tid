Water glides off this long captain's jacket with ease, granting you the ability to swim as fast as you can walk while wearing it. In addition, the jacket magically grants you -1 [[risk]] when operating a water vehicle or using [[navigator's tools]]. Finally, once per day, you can cast the [[fog cloud]] spell.
