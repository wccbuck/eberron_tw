Her years weigh\nupon her, and she is looking for a successor—not someone to lead the house, but someone to learn the secrets that she has borne for centuries. She knows tales long\nforgotten—stories that might be the key to great adventures. If she takes a PC Phiarlan as her apprentice, these secrets could inspire a campaign.",
