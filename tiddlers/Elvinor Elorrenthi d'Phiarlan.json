As the master of the [[Demesne of Shadow]], they are a remarkably evocative orator, and they can inspire trust or fear with their words. Despite\nshowing signs of slowing down in their middle years, they return to the stage annually to perform the Dance of Twenty Shadows, weaving [[darkness]], [[mirror image]], and other illusions into an unforgettable experience.\n\nElvinor's years weigh upon them, and they are looking for a successor—not someone to lead the house, but someone to learn the secrets that they have borne for centuries, including an [[heirloom performance]]. They know tales long forgotten—stories that might be the key to great adventures. If they take a [[Phiarlan]] player character as their apprentice, these secrets could inspire a campaign.\n",
