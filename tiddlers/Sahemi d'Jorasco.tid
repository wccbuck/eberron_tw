title: Sahemi d'Jorasco
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Sahemi "the Emissary" was one of House [[Jorasco]]’s brightest young healers when he was called to tend to the flood of refugees and wounded fleeing
what was once [[Cyre]] on the Day of [[Mourning]]. Dealing
with that crisis changed him somehow, and one night
he started walking northwest, disappearing into the
wilds of southern [[Thrane]].

After a two-year absence, Sahemi returned to
tell House [[Jorasco]] that the [[Mark of Healing]] should
be used not just to heal people, but to heal the land
as well. Using [[druid]]ic knowledge he learned in the
[[Eldeen Reaches]], Sahemi has started training young
members of House Jorasco in the ways of the [[Wardens of the Wood]]. Eventually, Sahemi wants to find a way to ritually cleanse the [[Mournland]] and make
it habitable again. He has not yet learned the entire
ritual, but every night he gains another piece of the
information while he dreams. A charismatic speaker,
Sahemi is something of a polarizing figure within
House Jorasco. Many of the elders distrust him, but
Sahemi’s expansive view of what the [[Mark of Healing]]
is capable of appeals to younger Jorascos.
