Solei plays the part of a native [[drow]] “savage” with panache. In truth, he is a city slicker born and bred to [[Stormreach]]’s urbane [[Cross]] district. Solei rarely leaves
the city, and on such occasions he never strays farther than a mile into the wilds. Recently Solei’s mother took ill with a bad case of cackle fever, and the young drow is desperate for money to pay for a [[restoration]] spell or similar treatment for her. The young [[rogue]] dreamed up a great scam to cash in on foreigners’ bigoted idea of his people as jungle-dwelling savages. Solei paints himself up like a native, and bluffs to offer his services. He claims he can guide travelers safely through “my people’s” [[jungle|Jungles of Xen'drik]]. Shortly after his clients pay his advance fee, he leads them out of town a short distance and disappears into the brush. Solei then beats a hasty a retreat back to Stormreach, hoping to cure his mother’s disease and hide from those he swindled.
