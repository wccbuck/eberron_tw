Shadar-kai are servants of the [[Queen of the Dead]], [[shade]]s
granted new life. Though their new forms appear [[elf]]-like, they
might've been any sort of humanoid in their previous life; when
they caught the Queen's attention, she preserved their soul from
entrapment. The shadar-kai serve in the [[Vault of Memories]], and
occasionally as her hands on [[Eberron]]. They might clash with
[[necromancers|necromancy]] (especially the agents of [[Lady Illmarrow]]), collect
trinkets, or target mortals with no rhyme or reason. Many sages
attempt to explain these enigmatic actions, often speculating that
they're collecting especially tragic memories for the Vault.
