Sword spiders are a type of giant arachnid that stalk forests and caverns, walking on legs that resemble razor-sharp blades. These solitary predators move incredibly fast and with great stealth for their large size. The sword spider's sleek, 12-foot-long body is encased in a durable black exoskeleton covered in fine dark hairs. Although their eyesight is poor, sword spiders locate their prey using [[tremorsense]] to feel for minute vibrations in the ground.

//''Natural Weapons.''// All eight legs of a sword spider end in thick chitinous plates with serrated ridges. However, its primary weapons are its front two legs, which look like a pair of massive curved swords. Its victims are impaled upon these limbs and brought close enough for the spider to deliver its poisonous bite. Once slain, its prey is then chopped up into manageable morsels that can be fed into its cavernous maw lined with multiple rows of crooked fangs.

//''Death From Above.''// Rather than trapping its food within a pre-constructed web, sword spiders prefer to wait for prey high up in tree branches and on cavern walls. (Despite their large frames, sword spiders retain the ability to cling to most surfaces, making them adept climbers.) Once it spots its prey, the spider sprays the creature with a restraining web and drops down with all eight of its lethal legs extended to impale its meal. When hunting in areas not conducive to this strategy, sword spiders instead stalk and chase their prey like big cats and are able to leap forward up to 30 feet, lashing out with their forelimbs.
