While wearing this fell bracer, you can speak its command word. The bracer severs your hand, dealing 1 [[harm]] to you, and animates it as an undead [[crawling claw]]. The creature acts on its own but follows your mental commands, as long as it remains within 30 feet of you. You can return your hand by holding it to your arm and speaking the command word again.
