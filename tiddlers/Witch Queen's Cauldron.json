The cauldron has two forms (see below). Only the Lady in Shadow can change the cauldron from one form to another, which it can do with a touch. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight\nclawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid.\n\nAny [[humanoid]] creature (or coven of three [[hag]]s) that attempts to use cauldron must attune to it first. The process of attunement is an ordeal of magical resolve. The humanoid must resist the cauldron's magic or else be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature has [[disadvantage]] on all actions, and will reach the end of its natural life span in about 10 days. Only a [[wish]] spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.\n\n!!! Gold Cauldron\n\nIn its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and is embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. It has the following properties.\n\n* If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew that provides one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.\n* If wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains an extra temporary [[harm]] box that lasts for up to eight hours. Any of the elixir that isn’t consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n* When the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a [[scrying]] spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell is unable to resist it, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different [[plane]]s of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.\n* Dipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a [[broom of flying]] for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\n!!! Iron Cauldron\n\nIn its second form, the cauldron is made of solid iron and is embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. It has the following properties.\n\n* You can scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a swarm of bats ([[creature tier]] ''1'') that flies out of the cauldron. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn’t been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n* If at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all [[humanoid]] creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it suffers [[harm]] or if someone shakes or slaps it awake. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n* Tying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water filled cauldron transforms the branch into a [[wand of polymorph]] with 3 charges. This wand can’t recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again for 8 days.\n* If you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a [[unicorn]]’s horn while reciting the poem called “The Witch Queen’s Cauldron” (see above), all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, can’t move or speak, doesn’t age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can’t be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another [[plane]] of existence, or touching it with a [[unicorn]]’s horn for 1 minute while reciting “The Witch Queen’s Cauldron” ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an [[antimagic field]] or is touched by a unicorn’s horn.\n\n!! Destroying the Cauldron\n\nThe cauldron is immune to damage to any source other than a [[flame tongue]] or [[frost brand]] weapon. Destroying the cauldron with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.\n\nIf all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a [[wish]] spell can reassemble them,\nrestoring the cauldron and all its properties.",
