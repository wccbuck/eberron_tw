        "text": "The prisoner in the Deep Ward of [[Dreadhold]], cell fourteen, is a mystery even to his jailers. Only Lord Warden [[Zaxon d'Kundarak]] knows the identity of this man, although it is common knowledge that he was shipped to Dreadhold by order of King [[Kaius III|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]]. He arrived at Dreadhold in 995 YK, and was immediately sent to his cell. His head and face are hidden beneath a steel mask sealed with an [[arcane lock]]. While this leaves his mouth free, some enchantment woven into the metal prevents him from speaking, and the guards have instructions not to allow him near anything that could be used as a writing implement. His movements are sluggish, leading some to believe that he has suffered brain damage, while others say this is another magical effect of the mask. All that is known for certain is that Kaius III wants this man kept aliveâ€”but he must not communicate with anyone.",
