The stamp of\nthe [[gorgon]]—the symbol of House Cannith—is a sign of\ngood quality and reasonable price, and can be found\non items as varied as horseshoes, longsword hilts, and\nwatertight barrels.\n\nThe guild maintains some retail establishments,\nbut it is largely content to focus on production and\nleave the selling to others. [[Cannith]] goods can be\nfound everywhere, both in the emporiums of [[Khorvaire]]’s largest cities and in the general stores on the edges of civilization.",
