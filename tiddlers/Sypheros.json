Recent observations using powerful spyglasses have confirmed that a jagged crack runs down the center of the moon, as if the moon is splitting in two. Many believe that children born in the month of Sypheros inherit a shifty, untrustworthy nature, and parents often seek to time pregnancies to avoid this month. However, the [[druid]]s say that the children of Sypheros are not evil; rather, they are comfortable with the shadows and can face them without fear.",
