Here,\nyou'll hear the howls of fading wolf spirits, and see flocks of\nspectral birds flying through grand halls, along with larger and\nfiercer creatures. Beast spirits rarely linger long in [[Dolurrh]], as\nmost have fewer memories to erase. But all dogs go to Dolurrh!\n\nThe [[Queen of the Dead]] might have created special servants\nthat wander these halls, just as she made the [[shadar-kai]]. It's\npossible adventurers could be questioned by a clever raven\nwith the soul of a poet.",
