title: whirlwind bolas
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The metal weights of this weapon are inscribed with spiraling sigils of the wind. If a creature's legs have been tangled with this weapon, you may say a command word. When commanded, the weights of the bolas begin to spin, creating a vortex of wind around the target. The vortex lifts the target 30 feet into the air, then releases it. The whirlwind bolas then return to the thrower.
