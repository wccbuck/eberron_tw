Zorlan d'Cannith leads House [[Cannith]]'s [[east faction|Cannith East]]. From the house’s [[enclave|Korth Enclave]] in
[[Karrnath]], Zorlan schemes against both [[Merrix|Merrix d'Cannith]] and
[[Jorlanna|Jorlanna d'Cannith]].  Zorlan’s mother was [[Starrin d'Cannith]]’s cousin, and
when he was young, Zorlan was one of Starrin’s chief
financial advisors. But he is as dry and calculating
as the ledgers he pores over, say his enemies. Others
decry his worship of the [[Blood of Vol]]; although the
faith is common in Karrnath, it is less so within the
ranks of House [[Cannith]]. Zorlan finds inspiration
in the teachings of the Blood of Vol, however, and
many of the best minds in the house are working on
developing the [[necromantic|necromancy]] creations that Zorlan first
conceived.

Though [[Zorlan d'Cannith]] grew up in [[Cyre]], he traveled to [[Karrnath]] as a house emissary along with the first [[warforged]] ordered by that nation. He took up residence there, advising King Jaron (son of [[Kaius II|Kaius ir'Wynarn II]]) and strengthening his house’s influence. He used profitable arrangements with the [[Mror Holds]] and the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] to fill his coffers and make himself an advisor to the Gorgon, [[Starrin|Starrin d'Cannith]].
