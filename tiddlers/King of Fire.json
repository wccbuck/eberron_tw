        "text": "The most common deck of\nplaying cards used in [[Khorvaire]] has four suits, each\ntied to one of the four elements. The largest tavern\nin Hareth's Folly uses the King of Fire as its trade\nsign. The tavern, a strange structure supposedly\ninspired by Hareth's visions of [[Fernia]], consists of\nblack stone and brass, and [[continual flame]] spells have\nbeen placed on fixtures throughout the buildingâ€”\nincluding tables and chairs. Half a dozen card games\nconstantly play out in the back rooms of the King,\nand the place does a brisk business in gambling on\nraces and [[skyblade]] matches.\n\nLat Horasca, a former [[glidewing]] jockey, owns the tavern, which he won in a\ndramatic hand of cards. Lat is a gambler, not an innkeeper, but he has married into House [[Ghallanda]] and\nhis wife Kela manages the day-to-day affairs of the business. Things\ncan get rowdy during the [[Race of Eight Winds]], but Lat\nhas wisely invested in an excellent bouncer, an [[ogre]]\nnamed Korrla. When she's\nnot working, Korrla often fights at the [[Burning Ring]]\nin [[Lower Menthis]].",
