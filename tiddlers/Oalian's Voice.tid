type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The [[Wardens of the Wood]] maintain a network of [[awaken]]ed birds and other animals who act as scouts and messengers across the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. Many of these creatures have been awakened by [[Oalian]] themself, and roost in the branches of the Great Druid when they return to [[Greenheart]]. Given how few Eldeen communities have [[Sivis]] [[message stations|speaking stone]], these [[beast]]s play an important role in maintaining connections between communities. Theyâ€™re far more than [[animal messenger]]s; while they carry important messages between sect leaders, they also share stories and news with the general community, and many are celebrated entertainers. Beyond this, part of their work is to gather and spread information; in may ways, the Voice is the [[Eldeen|Eldeen Reaches]] answer to the [[Korranberg Chronicle]]. So adventurers could very well find themselves being interviewed by a raven, who then spreads word of their deed across the Reaches!
