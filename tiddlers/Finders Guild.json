In addition to locating\n[[dragonshard]]s and other precious resources, the guild\nundertakes more mundane tasks, such as helping\nvillages find sources of water or helping archaeologists locate relics. The guild has even worked with\n[[Riedra]]ns in [[Xen'drik]], finding the crystals that the\nRiedrans use in their architecture.\n\nThe Finders Guild also dominates the urban [[inquisitive]] trade, providing a wide range of investigative services. Its primary competition in this field is House [[Medani]], but whereas Medani provides counter-espionage to wealthy clients, the Finders Guild makes\nits services available to the common folk.\n\nFinally, the Finders Guild trains and licenses bounty huntersâ€”both those who hunt fugitives (and who must compete with the [[Sentinel Marshals]] of House [[Deneith]]) and those\nwho eliminate dangerous monsters.",
