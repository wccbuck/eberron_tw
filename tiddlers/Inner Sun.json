        "text": "Collectively, the [[Cults of the Dragon Below]] are anything but monolithic. Creeds vary wildly from one group to another. However, one shared precept is that the world is an imperfect place. [[Khyber]] sought to perfect it—to eliminate pain, suffering, death and all other woes—but the other [[Progenitors|Progenitor Dragons]] turned on her, and when [[Eberron]] couldn’t defeat Khyber, she trapped her.\n\nThe cult of the Inner Sun takes this credo quite literally. This ancient and widespread cult can be found across the west coast of [[Khorvaire]], from the [[Shadow Marches]] to the [[Demon Wastes]]. The belief is particularly popular among the [['Aashta]] clan of House [[Tharashk]]. Cultists believe that there is a paradise within [[Khyber]]: the [[Vale of the Inner Sun]], a place free from suffering and death. To earn passage to the Vale, a champion must defeat a host of worthy foes, dedicating their souls to an entity they call the \"[[Gatekeeper|Katashka]]\" (not to be confused with the [[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]] [[druid]]ic sect). Cults vary on the criteria for “worthy foe”—while some cultists are serial killers, others only consider monsters or evildoers as qualifying for their passage.\n\nMost Inner Sun followers consider the [[Vale|Vale of the Inner Sun]] to be a place that can be reached only after death, but many maintain that the Vale is a physical place that can be found by thoroughly exploring the depths of [[Khyber]].",
