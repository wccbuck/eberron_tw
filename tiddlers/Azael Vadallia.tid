One of the deadliest [[wight]]s of the last century, Azael [[Vadallia]] is a [[Valaes Tairn]] wight who is said to be searching for warriors worthy to join his [[undead]] [[warband]]. Though most wights can only raise their victims as [[zombie]]s, the members of Azael's warband are [[wight]]s like him.
