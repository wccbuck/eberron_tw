        "text": "Jutting fiercely into the sky along the southern shores of [[Lake Galifar]], the Blackcap Mountains (or \"Blackcaps\") in [[Breland]] form the nation's border with [[Aundair]]. Few trees grow on the lower slopes of the ominous mountains, and thick banks of clouds cling to the bare peaks. The mountains take their name from the complete lack of snow on the dark stone. Explorers who have dared the heights report that the rock faces are almost uncomfortably warm day and night, and any snow that falls melts immediately as it hits the surface. Dozens of streams flow from the mountains into [[Lake Galifar]] and [[Silver Lake]].\n\nThe highest point in [[Breland]] is found in the Blackcap Mountains: Erix Peak, at 13,256 feet. But perhaps the strangest mountain in the Blackcaps is Kyrrilspire, which exists inside a permanent [[manifest zone]] to [[Kythri]]. The mountain changes shape from day to day.\n\nThe Blackcaps are also home to the infamous [[Black Pit]].",
