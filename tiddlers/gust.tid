You seize the air and compel it to create one of the following effects at a point you can see within 30 feet:

* One [[human]]-sized or smaller creature that you choose must withstand the winds or be pushed up to 5 feet away from you.
* You create a small blast of air capable of moving objects within a five-foot cone that are neither held nor carried and that weigh no more than 5 pounds. The objects are pushed up to 10 feet away from you. They aren't pushed with enough force to cause damage. This effect also displaces vapor, gas, or fog within the five-foot cone.
* You create a harmless sensory effect using air, such as causing leaves to rustle, wind to slam shutters closed, or your clothing to ripple in a breeze.
