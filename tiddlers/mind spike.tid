You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within 60 feet. The target must resist your magic or else suffer psychic damage. On a success, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends (up to 1 hour, or until your concentration breaks), but only while the two of you are on the same [[plane]] of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can't become hidden from you, and if it's invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.
