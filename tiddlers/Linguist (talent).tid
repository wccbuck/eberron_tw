Gain the ability to speak and write two additional [[language]]s. Also, for all languages you know, gain a limited ability to understand closely related languages. 

For example, if you know [[Aerenese]], you may be able to understand the gist of a conversation spoken in [[Sylvan]], [[Giant]], or [[Liotian]]. If you also speak fluent [[Common]], you can fully understand and speak [[Liotian]].
