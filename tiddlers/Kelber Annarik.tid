title: Kelber Annarik
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Kelber Annarik, along with his twin brother, Vi Annarik, own and operate the Spicy Brothers stall in the [[Dinsiin Night Market|Dinsiin (Dyn Singh) Night Market adventure notes]] of [[Starilaskur]]. Their stall features rare peppers and spices. While Vi has a zest for life, Kelber is reserved and calculating. He's also the one behind the sabotage currently afflicting the [[Tyenmo|Lamai Tyenmo]] and [[Zunguun|Kusa Zunguun]] stalls.

Kelber wears a flashy green shirt with a high collar and gold filigree trim designed to look like hot peppers.

!! Kelber's Plan

Several weeks ago, Vi told his brother he's getting married and moving to [[Xandrar]]. Kelber knows he can't continue Spicy Brothers without Vi's charm, and concocted a plan to buy out another successful business. But most business in the Dinsiin Night Market are family shops the owners would never consider selling. 

While snooping around the market in advance of the grand opening, Kelber came across a box of "windlings" (as in to wind a watch, they look like wind-up toys) among the stock of Doseth the traveling merchant. (Doseth obtained these through a bargain with [[Granny Nightshade|Skabatha Nightshade]].) The written instructions say that the windlings would perform one favor for you if you wind them up and whisper your request. It would perform the favor "to the best of its ability, at the cost of the least of yours." Kelber thinks this is a bargain, since in his words, "I'm not good at anything anyway." The windling disappears after it's used once, but the wind-up key remains. 

Throughout the adventure, Kelber winds up a windling and sends it off to sabotage Tyenmo Noodles or Zunguun Family Seafood, or steal from their earnings. He doesn't want to hurt anyone, but he hopes to make life in the market uncomfortable enough that one of the families sells its shop to him for a low price.

However, each time he does this, he suffers a mild curse, losing "the least of" his abilities. When the party meets Kelber, he's already lost the ability to tie or untie rope. He whistles when they meet him. The next time they see him, he's lost the ability to whistle. Other minor curses:

* Can't catch items thrown at him
* Cannot turn right
* Cannot conceptualize "eleven"
