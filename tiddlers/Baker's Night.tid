On this night, families
and friends gather to share magnificent pastries and similar treats, prepared by bakers and confectioners faithful
to the [[Silver Flame]]. This is one of the most popular Flame holidays, particularly among children, yet it is also the least
understood. It has been a tradition since the earliest days
of the church, yet not even the [[Cathedral of the Silver Flame]] in
[[Flamekeep]], [[Thrane]], has records suggesting where it came
from, when it was adopted, or what it celebrates. Practice
of Bakerâ€™s Night has begun to fade in some of the more ascetic Thrane communities, and it might slowly disappear from the calendar in coming generations.
