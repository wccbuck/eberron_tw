title: Mark of Finding
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Mark of Finding sharpens the senses, guiding the
hunter to prey. It first appeared in the [[Shadow Marches]], where
clan hunters used it to find their quarry. Today, bounty hunters and prospectors use the mark to track down people of interest or valuable items.

Only a [[half-orc]] (or [[human]] with just a bit of [[orc]] ancestry) with ties to House [[Tharashk]] can manifest this [[dragonmark]].
