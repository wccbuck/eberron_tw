title: Galifar-Lhazaar War
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The [[Lhazaar Principalities]] developed during the same period
when the [[Five Nations]] were formed, more than a thousand
years before the birth of [[Galifar]]. By the time King [[Galifar I|Galifar Wynarn]] was uniting the Five Nations, the Principalities were well
established, as was their inhabitants’ well-deserved reputation as raiders and pirates. When Galifar proclaimed that his kingdom “stretched across the width and breadth
of [[Khorvaire]],” the Lhazaar princes ignored him. Their
domains were far from the great cities of the Five Nations,
separated by a formidable [[mountain range|Ironroot Mountains]] and the endless seas over which the princes ruled supreme.

By 28 YK, King Galifar had fortified his hold over the
[[Five Nations]] and turned his attention to the threat from
the east. The Lhazaar princes and sea barons were wreaking havoc among the coastal communities, interfering with
shipping and refusing to bend to the will of the crown.
Thus began the Galifar-Lhazaar War, a series of naval
engagements that lasted nearly a decade. The sea barons
knew the currents better and started out with better vessels,
but Galifar dedicated his efforts to building a powerful
navy. Aided by magic and the help of some of the [[dragonmarked house]]s, Galifar was able to garner enough victories to force the Lhazaar princes to meet to discuss terms. In the end, the Principalities became part of Galifar’s kingdom but remained autonomous, the Lhazaar princes more or less independent within their own domains yet agreeing to
pay tribute to Galifar and recognize him as the legitimate ruler of the mainland kingdom.
