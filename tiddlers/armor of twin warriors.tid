This suit of green-hued half-plate armor allows the wearer to summon a double of themselves as a [[rare-tier|spell tier]] [[spell]]. The double will attack designated enemies until it suffers a mortal injury, or until one minute has passed, after which it will crumble away into dust. The double cannot speak, and its physical details seem slightly blurred.
