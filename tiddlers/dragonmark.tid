type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A [[halfling]] healer touches a dying man; the mark on her
forehead blazes with blue fire as his wounds close and
vanish. A [[half-orc]] bounty hunter reaches out with the
power of his mark to find his prey. A [[human]] [[artificer]]
touches a [[creation forge]], and the symbol on her hand
flares as the eldritch machine rumbles to life. Each of
these people possesses a dragonmark, a symbol etched
on the skin in colors more vivid than any tattoo, magical
power made flesh.

A dragonmark enhances the user's ability to perform
certain tasks. For example, the [[Mark of Making]] guides
the hands of the smith, while the [[Mark of Shadow]]
helps its bearer avoid enemies. The power of a dragonmark can also manifest in more dramatic ways. The
[[Mark of Storm]] can scatter enemies with a blast of
wind, while the [[Mark of Shadow]] can weave illusions.

You can't buy or choose to develop a dragonmark;
each mark is tied to [[bloodlines|dragonmarked house]] within specific species,
as summarized in the table below. A dragonmark appears on a person around adolescence (usually with the help of the [[Test of Siberys]]), though not every heir manifests the mark.

{{DragonmarksTable}}

Long ago, the families that carry the marks joined
together to form the [[dragonmarked house]]s. Over the
course of centuries, these houses have used their gifts
to establish powerful monopolies. For example, only
House [[Lyrandar]] heirs with the [[Mark of Storm]] can
pilot [[airship]]s. This control over vital services gives the
houses tremendous power. 

!! Dragonmarks and Backgrounds

Dragonmarks are bound to certain bloodlines, and by
choosing a mark, you are establishing your character's
blood connection to one of the families in the dragonmarked houses. It's up to you to define your relationship
to the house. Were you brought up in the house? Or are
you independent from it? This is best represented by
a "[[background]]" talent. Consider the following options:

* ''Agent.'' You have a close, ongoing relationship with your house. The [[House Agent]] talent is a good choice if you are actively working for the house. Alternately, you could take the [[Noble]] talent to reflect a blood tie to the leaders of the house.
* ''Independent Scion.'' You were raised or trained by the house, but you've kept your independence. This means you don't have many special privileges, but you also don't have responsibilities. [[Guild Artisan]] is a good choice to reflect basic house training, but you could choose [[Entertainer]] for the [[Mark of Shadow]], [[Sailor]] for the [[Mark of Storm]], [[Rhetorician]] for the [[Mark of Scribing]], and so on.
* ''Excoriate.'' When a dragonmarked heir defies their house, they might be cut off from their family. In the past, your mark would be flayed from your body. Although this mutilation is no longer practiced, such exiles are still called excoriates. If you're an excoriate, consider what you did to deserve this punishment. Were you a [[Criminal]]? A [[Charlatan]]? Or perhaps a [[Sage]] who engaged in forbidden research?
* ''Foundling.'' Your ancestors left the house long ago. You have no ties to the house and may not have known you were connected by blood before you manifested your dragonmark. As an [[Outlander]] or an [[Urchin]], you might know nothing about the houses. As an [[Acolyte]], you could have put your faith ahead of worldly things, choosing not to pursue a connection with the houses. Whatever you decide, this is an opportunity to talk with your GM about the role you'd like the house to play in a campaign. Do you want them to be your enemy? Would you prefer to avoid them completely? Or do you want to work your way into a position of power in the house, despite being an outsider? 

!! The Powers of the Mark

Each dragonmark grants a set of abilities that reflect the
inherent powers of the mark. Your dragonmarked race
gives you a set of traits derived from the magic of your
mark. If you are a spellcaster, your dragonmark also fuels or channels some of your spells. 

Over the centuries, the houses have developed tools that enhance and channel the powers of a mark, and these [[dragonmark focus item]]s give the houses much of their economic power. 

!! Dragonmark Appearance

A dragonmark appears on the skin. There are twelve
known dragonmarks, each unique in design and power.
A dragonmark can appear on any part of the body. One
[[half-elf]] could have the [[Mark of Detection]] across an eye,
while another has it in the palm of the hand. Dragonmarks appear with vivid shades of blue and purple and
shimmer or even move slightly. When used, they grow
warm to the touch and sometimes glow (though this
doesn't produce useful illumination). A dragonmark
can't be removed—even if a limb bearing a dragonmark
is cut away, the mark eventually manifests on another
part of the bearer's body. All dragonmarks share a similar initial appearance, but a dragonmark can grow in
size and complexity as a character gains levels and uses
it to cast more powerful magic.

While dragonmarks share the same general appearance, your dragonmark could have a unique quality. Roll
on the table below for inspiration.

| 6 |When you use your dragonmark, it animates and adopts the appearance of your dragon marked house's emblem for 1 minute. |
| 7 |Your dragonmark is an unusual color. |
| 8 |Your dragonmark changes size whenever you use it. |

!! Dragonmark Manifestation and the Prophecy

The dragonmarks are driven by more than simple genetics. In most [[dragonmarked house]]s, about half of the children develop some level of mark. Over the course of a thousand years of excoriates and voluntary departures, many people in [[Khorvaire]] have some trace of dragonmarked blood. And yet, foundlings—people who develop a dragonmark outside a house—are rare. Many houses allow outsiders to marry into their great lines, and the number of dragonmarked heirs born to such couples within the houses is dramatically higher than those born to excoriates outside of the houses. 

Scholars have proposed many theories to explain this discrepancy. Some say that it’s tied to proximity—that being around large numbers of dragonmarked people helps to nuture the latent mark within a child. Others say that it’s related to the tools and equipment used by the houses—that just being around a [[creation forge]] helps promote the development of the [[Mark of Making]]. One of the most interesting theories comes from the sage [[Ohnal Caldyn]]. A celebrated student of the [[Draconic Prophecy]], Caldyn argued that the oft-invoked connection between dragonmarks and the Prophecy might be misunderstood—that rather than each dragonmarked individual having significance, the Prophecy might be more interested in [[dragonmarked families|dragonmarked house]]. It’s been over two thousand years since the Mark of Making appeared on the Vown and Juran lines of [[Cyre]]—and yet those families remain pillars of House [[Cannith]] today.

!! Siberys Dragonmarks

Rarely, a dragonmarked character develops power that surpasses that of other dragonmarked heirs—a fighter with the [[Mark of Passage]] could teleport even though they have no other spellcasting ability, and a [[Ghallanda]] innkeeper could summon a [[magnificent mansion]]. These rarest and most powerful of dragonmarks are known as [[Siberys]] dragonmarks. They are larger and have a far more complex pattern than do other dragonmarks. Typically, a Siberys dragonmark evolves from an existing mark, following a dire situation in which the bearer performs a remarkable feat related to the abilities of their developing mark. However, on even rarer occasion, someone spontaneously manifests a massive, powerful dragonmark despite having never possessed a lesser one.

Regardless of whether they manifest on a dragonmarked heir or an unknown foundling, the [[dragonmarked house]]s value heirs with Siberys dragonmarks. A character who
displays such a mark is treated with more respect by other members of the house, but the barons and seneschals may also place greater demands on them. So a Siberys dragonmark is a blessing, but it can also be a burden. The manifestation of a Siberys dragonmark—especially one appearing spontaneously on an unmarked character—can be a sign that the bearer has an important role in the [[Draconic Prophecy]], as well as a warning that [[dragon]]s, [[fiend]]s, and other powerful forces may try to manipulate or harm the character.

!! Dragonmarks and Sarlona

[[Sarlona]] was the birthplace of humanity, and today [[human]]s make up the vast majority of the dragonmarked population, but no dragonmarks have ever
appeared on the people of Sarlona. Early signs indicate
that the children of dragonmarked parents don't develop
dragonmarks if they are conceived in Sarlona. The [[Twelve]]
has no explanation for this phenomenon, but many
believe that it is one of the keys to the ultimate mystery of
the dragonmarks and their purpose in the world.
