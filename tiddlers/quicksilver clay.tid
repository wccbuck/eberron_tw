title: quicksilver clay
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This small orb of silver liquid is strangely dry to the touch. While holding the 1-inch-diameter sphere in the palm of your hand, you can mentally control the form that it takes. The orb reshapes itself as you see fit and remains centered in your hand. Regardless of the form, it can be no larger than the palm of your hand in any dimension, and is always a semi-liquid. The form returns to its natural orb state when you end your focus on the quicksilver clay, or it leaves your hand.
