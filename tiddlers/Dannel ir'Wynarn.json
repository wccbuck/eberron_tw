Dannel’s uncanny charisma inspired her nation and kept spirits high despite Cyre's losses near the end of [[Last War]].\n\nQueen Dannel was in [[Metrol]] on the Day of [[Mourning]] and is presumed dead. Her grandson, Prince [[Oargev ir'Wynarn]], is the last surviving member of the [[Cyran|Cyre]] ruling family, and holds court in [[New Cyre]]. \n\nRumors still swirl that before the\nconflagration, Queen Dannel planned some great\nnew offensive to save [[Cyre]]. At the time, her struggling\nnation still had patriots willing to fight and die for\ntheir land. Huge battles were taking place on Cyran\nground when the [[Mourning]] occurred—battles that,\nwithout the Mourning, might have silenced Cyre’s\nambitions forever. Some speculate that the queen had\nsomething to do with the Mourning.",
