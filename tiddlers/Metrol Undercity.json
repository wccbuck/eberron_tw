        "text": "[[Metrol]] was designed to be a showpiece, a vision\nof what [[Galifar]] could be—and its less attractive\naspects were pushed underground, making use of\nold [[Dhakaan]]i foundations. Before the [[Mourning]] there were no slums on\nthe surface of Metrol, because they were all hidden\nbelow the surface. The Undercity contains the\nsewers and the actual workings of the city, along\nwith vast tenement housing and anything considered too unsightly to have on the surface. \n\nThe Undercity stretches across [[Metrol]], each section\nlargely reflecting the character of the quarter above\nit. So the Undercity beneath [[Market Triangle|Northshore]]\nhoused seedy businesses, while the Undercity\nbeneath [[Southshore]] included both cheap housing\nfor actors and venues for the lowest forms of entertainment. The [[Lycaeum]] has an Undercity of its own, but it’s still separated from the rest of the city\nby the [[River Melandor]].\n\nToday, the Metrol Undercity is thought to be where the mysterious [[ghostbeast]]s dwell during daylight hours.",
