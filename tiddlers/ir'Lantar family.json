        "text": "The [[half-elf]] ir’Lantar family has enjoyed success\nwithin [[Aundair]] since before [[Galifar]] was sundered.\nExtensive holdings outside [[Fairhaven]], as well as its\nmanor and grounds within, attest to this success.\nFamily history has it that ir’Lantar ancestors lived\nhere when the foundations of Fairhaven were being\nset. Countess [[Tesyn ir'Lantar]], a well-known [[warlock]], has encouraged all her children into service to the [[Aundairian Crown|Aurala ir'Wynarn]]. Her youngest twins, [[Alais and Helais|Aundair Embassy (Sharn)]], serve as the queen’s ambassadors to [[Breland]] in [[Sharn]].\n\nThe truth is that the ir’Lantar family has been in league with fiendish servants of [[Sul Khatesh]] for generations. They owe numerous triumphs to\ntheir affiliation with the [[rakshasa]]s. All the adults\nknow of the family’s true history, and the children are\nraised to be decorous in appearance but cruel. Helais,\none of the [[Royal Eyes]] of [[Aundair]] who regularly\nreturns to [[Fairhaven]], is a guise used by two rakshasas,\n[[Zathara]] and [[Nethatar]]. The ir’Lantars are willing to go\nto any length to protect their secret, and their public\nactions are rarely suspicious.",
