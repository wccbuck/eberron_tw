The mighty fiend known as Yad-Raghesh is a mystery; [[loredrake]] scholars question whether they were actually a minor [[overlord]], or merely an exceptionally powerful champion of [[Sakinnirot]] or [[Ran Iishiv]]. What is known is that during the wars of the [[Age of Demons]], Yad-Raghesh fought in the form of a colossal two-headed [[rakshasa]]; that they were defeated with surprising ease; and that it was later discovered that they had somehow imbued their essence into the region in which they were slain, permanently corrupting it. The corpse of Yad-Raghesh remains in this [[Vale of the Fallen Rajah]], which seethes with hatred and [[fiend]]s. There is no evidence that the consciousness of Yad-Raghesh remains as an active force, and they play no role in the [[Lords of Dust]].
