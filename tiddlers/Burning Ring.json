It moves frequently\nas the [[Sharn Watch]] keeps trying to shut it down, but\nit seems to find a place to operate every night. It\noffers blood sport, gladiator-style combat conducted\nby amateur and professional warriors. The combat\nis real—the combatants use a variety of weapons but\nwear no armor—and sometimes matches end in\ndeath. Ideally, the healer on hand for every fight\nreaches a fallen combatant before he dies, but sometimes the fallen are beyond help. Death only seems\nto make the crowds cheer louder.\n\nThe ringmaster is Hoas Junter ([[shifter]]), who has extensive connections to the [[Daask]]\ngang. Sometimes his connections help him bring in a\nmonster as a combatant to the crowd's utter delight.\nThe monster usually wins.\n\nFinding the Burning Ring on any given night requires gathering information from the locals in [[Firelight]] or [[Torchfire]].
