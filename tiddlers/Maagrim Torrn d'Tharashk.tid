Maagrim Torrn d’Tharashk represents the [[Torrn]] clan in the [[Tharashk triumvirate]]. The oldest triumvir and a skilled [[druid]], she is known for her wisdom and her patience, though she’s not afraid to shout down [[Khandar'Aashta]] when he goes too far. Maagrim supports the [[Valshar'ak Seal]] and helps direct resources to the sect, but as a triumvir her primary focus is on the business and the success of the [[house|Tharashk]]. On a day-to-day basis she is most concerned with monitoring mining operations and maintaining infrastructure. Maagrim is firmly neutral, driven neither by cruelty or compassion; she does what must be done.
