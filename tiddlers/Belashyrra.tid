Belashyrra is the Lord of Eyes, also known to its cultists as the All-Seer or the Glorious Eye. Stories told of Belashyrra in the [[Shadow Marches]] whisper that the Lord of Eyes can see every evil deed a person commits, and that those touched by this [[daelkyr]] suffer terrible hallucinations that inevitably drive them to violence or death.

//''Dreadful Visions.''// The madness of Belashyrra is tied to sight: images that can't be unseen, horrific hallucinations, the fear of blindness and of being watchedâ€”or realizing that something else is using your eyes. Belashyrra can force its victims to question whether what they perceive is real, or can fill their world with such terrors that they willingly blind themselves to escape.

Belashyrra sees mortals as raw materials to be exploited or insects to be exterminated. However, the Lord of Eyes has been known to take an interest in specific mortals. Belashyrra's [[warlock]]s serve as its envoys in the world and are often directed to seek out creatures and sites that the daelkyr wishes to see through their eyes.

//''Belashyrra's Cults.''// The Lord of Eyes has followers across Khorvaire, and its cults are typically driven by mad visions. Devoted cultists, such as members of the [[Vigilant Eye]], can grow eyes in unusual locations, and might have [[darkvision]] or other supernatural abilities when they view the world through those eyes. [[Beholderkin|beholder]] often advise or lead Belashyrra's cults, and cultists typically treat these [[aberration]]s as divine beings.
