{"created": "20210120013819330", "text": "The Thunder Sea lies between [[Khorvaire]], [[Aerenal]],\nand [[Xen'drik]]. [[Zarash Bay]] marks its western extent,\nand to the east it flows into the [[Dragonreach]] (via the [[Aerenal]] Channel) and the [[Dark Sea]]. It takes its name from the unnatural storms that rage over some\nareas, never-ending tempests fueled by the elemental power of\n[[Lamannia]]. As dangerous as these waters are, this is a crucial crossroads for trade, and there\u2019s a constant stream of ships\nflowing between [[Sharn]], [[Stormreach]], and [[Pylas Talaear]]. It\u2019s here\nthat the [[sahuagin]] first arose, the seat of their greatest civilization.\n\nToday, the sahuagin of the [[Eternal Dominion]] are spread far\nand wide across the floor of the Thunder Sea. Their mightiest\ncities are built around\u2014and into\u2014massive slumbering\ncreatures known as [[kar'lassa]], \u201cgreat dreamers.\u201d The [[merfolk]]\nlive in the upper waters above the sahuagin. Their permanent\nsettlements are tied to [[manifest zone]]s, and they perform\nrituals to contain the threat posed by these zones. The other\nmajor power in the Thunder Sea is the [[Valraean Protectorate]],\nthe domain of the [[sea elves|sea elf]]. These elves laid claim to the\nwaters around [[Aerenal]], conquering the local [[sahuagin]] and\nother species, and bending them to their will. The [[Dominion|Eternal Dominion]]\n[[sahuagin]] despise the Valraean elves, but thus far, the power\nof the [[Undying Court]] has repelled every assault.\n\nWhat will bring your adventurers to the Thunder Sea? Will\nyou delve into the depths to explore ruins built by long-dead\n[[giant]]s? Will you negotiate with [[sahuagin]] and work to prevent a\nwar between land and sea? Or will you struggle to survive after\nyou\u2019re pulled down by the [[aboleth]]s and the ancient evils that\nlurk in the ultimate darkness?\n\n!! Ports and Travel\n\nThe Thunder Sea is a critical path for trade. Any traffic with\n[[Xen'drik]] crosses the Thunder Sea. In addition to the ships of\nHouse [[Lyrandar]] (both elemental galleons with [[dragonmarked|Mark of Storm]] captains and mundane ships licensed by the house), the\nThunder Sea sees traffic from [[Aerenal]], [[Zilargo]], [[Breland]],\nand [[Riedra]]. The most important ports include [[Pylas Maradal]]\n([[Valenar]]), [[Pylas Talaear]] ([[Aerenal]]), [[Sharn]] ([[Breland]]), [[Stormreach]]\n(Xen\u2019drik), [[Trolanport]] ([[Zilargo]]), [[Wyvernskull]] ([[Darguun]]), and\n[[Zarash'ak]] ([[Shadow Marches]]).\n\nThese major ports see both commercial, diplomatic,\nand military traffic. [[Aereni]] merchants carry shipments of\nexotic lumber, [[Riedra]]n vessels are laden with [[crysteel]] and\n[[dragonshard]]s, [[Lyrandar]] ships carry all manner of trade goods,\nand smugglers sneak barrels of [[kuryeva]] and [[tilxin blood]] into\nhidden coves. While the standard map of [[Khorvaire]] focuses on\nthese major ports, there are also countless smaller ports and\nfishing villages scattered along the coastline.\n\nThe masters of the Thunder Sea\u2014the [[sahuagin]]\u2014don\u2019t\nwant dryskins blundering through their territory. Traveling\ndirectly along the coastline is reasonably safe, and local\nfisherfolk don\u2019t need to negotiate with sahuagin every time\nthey set sail; the sahuagin don\u2019t lay claim to the waters within\n6 miles of [[Khorvaire]]\u2019s coast, and permit fishing an additional\n20 miles beyond that. But crossing the Thunder Sea is an\nentirely different story. Setting aside the territorial claims of\nthe sahuagin, the sea is filled with deadly hazards\u2014endless\nstorms, [[demonglass]] spires, and hungry [[monstrosities|monstrosity]].\n\nThe [[Eternal Dominion]] has established specific routes that\ncaptains must follow, safe from hazards and monitored by\nthe Dominion. Captains who wish to use these routes must\nobtain //beacons of passage//\u2014[[common|rarity]] [[magic item]]s that tell the\n[[sahuagin]] their travel is authorized, charged to last for a set\ntime. Even with a beacon, there are places\u2014such as [[Shargon's Teeth]]\u2014where a wise captain pays for the services of a [[sahuagin]]\nor [[merfolk]] guide.\n\nSome brave (or foolish) souls deviate from these approved\nroutes, whether desiring speed or avoiding the cost of local\ncustoms and the price of a beacon. The Thunder Sea is nearly\nthe size of [[Khorvaire]] itself, and the [[sahuagin]] aren\u2019t everywhere;\nhowever, those regions shunned by the sahuagin and [[merfolk]]\nare usually avoided with good reason, and smugglers may face\ndangerous environmental hazards or hungry sea monsters.\n\n!! The Power of Lamannia\n\nThe storms of the Thunder Sea are legendary. Beyond wind\nand rain, tales speak of maelstroms that drag down even the\nlargest vessels and masses of vegetation that rise from the\nwater to entangle ships. All of these are very real threats,\neven more so because these dangers don\u2019t obey simple laws\nof wind and water. The Thunder Sea is home to a wide range\nof [[manifest zone]]s, but the most powerful and numerous are\nthose tied to [[Lamannia]]. The endless fury of the [[First Storm]]\nlashes ships with lightning and storm winds, and great\nmaelstroms can pull a ship down into the [[Endless Ocean]].\nThe vast masses of vegetation are tied to the [[Twilight Forest]],\nfueling unnatural growth that can latch onto a vessel and trap\nit in the sargassum. Though the influence of Lamannia is\nmost strongly felt here, it\u2019s also possible to find an unexpected\nregion of icebergs surrounding a [[manifest zone]] tied to [[Risia]],\nboiling waters around a [[Fernia]]n zone, or a region tied to\n[[Mabar]] where the shadows of sailors turn on the living.\n\nAs any skilled ocean navigator can tell you, [[manifest zone]]s\nare stable, physical locations. While a manifest zone\u2019s influence\nextends beyond its focal point, the worst storms of the Thunder\nSea remain confined to specific areas. However, when the\nplane linked to a manifest zone is coterminous, its impact is\ndramatically enhanced, with storms extending beyond their\nusual radius and becoming far more powerful. This is why\nknowledge of the sea is vitally important for sailors; if you\nventure off the approved trade routes, you need to chart a\ncourse that will avoid the storms.\n\n[[Lamannia]]n [[manifest zone]]s often release [[elemental]]s into\n[[Eberron]]. An eternal storm may contain air elementals,\nwhile water elementals can be found in the region around a\nmaelstrom. Such elementals aren\u2019t intentionally cruel, but\nthey\u2019re driven to express their elemental drives\u2014which often\nmakes them dangerous to ships, which they perceive as alien\ninvaders. Manifest zones can also produce [[dire beast]]s\u2014octopi,\nsharks, and other creatures of remarkable size.\n\nThe [[merfolk]] of the Thunder Sea serve as planar shepherds, tending\n[[manifest zone]]s and helping to contain and mitigate their\neffects. This isn\u2019t absolute; the merfolk can\u2019t entirely disperse\nthe power of the [[First Storm]], or stop the growth of the [[Twilight Forest]]. But they seek to direct it, choosing to vent its power at times when there is minimal danger to innocents. Even when a region has especially bad storms due to a manifest zone,\nthose storms could be far, far worse if the merfolk stopped\nperforming their rituals or were driven away entirely.\n\n!! Haunted Ruins and the Deepest Darkness\n\nThe Thunder Sea is vast and ancient. The [[sahuagin]] call their\ncivilization the [[Eternal Dominion]], but in truth, it\u2019s risen and\nfallen multiple times. The [[Lurker in Shadow]], as well, has nearly risen\nseveral times, and [[aboleth]]s have set the sea devils against one\nanother in vicious civil wars. There are a handful of [[storm giant]]s\nin the depths, but any nation they once possessed was destroyed\nlong ago. Remnants of these conflicts are spread across the\nThunder Sea. Explorers could find an ancient temple haunted\nby the ghosts of the storm giants that built it, an overgrown\nsahuagin fortress from a previous age of the Dominion, or the\ntomb of a [[dragon]] sealed tens of thousands of years ago.\n\nMost dangerous of all are the deepest abysses, strongholds of the surviving servants of the [[Lurker in Shadow]]. These cracks in the ocean floor might hold mighty artifacts forged during the [[Age of Demons]], but they\u2019re home to [[aboleth]]s, [[fiend]]s, and even more terrifying creatures.\n\n!! What Roams the Sea?\n\nWhen dealing with the Thunder Sea, remember that it\u2019s just as\ncivilized as the [[Five Nations]]. It does have wilderness regions\nwith feral beasts roaming at will, and you might find wild\nplesiosaurs, a scheming [[sea hag]], or a hungry [[scrag|troll]]. But in\nthe areas above and around [[sahuagin]] city-states, such beasts\nhave been tamed or destroyed. All cultures of the Thunder\nSea farm fish like the people of the land farm sheep or cattle;\na pod of whales may be carefully managed and cultivated, and\ntheir farmers will be quite angry with dryskins who poach their\nichthyic livestock. There are sharks\u2014and giant sharks\u2014in the\nwild waters, but in the civilized zones, the sahuagin use them\nmuch as humans use hounds. [[Drake turtle|drake turtle]]s serve different\nroles depending where they\u2019re found; in the [[Dominion|Eternal Dominion]], drake\nturtles are forced to serve as beasts of burden and living\nengines of war, while the [[merfolk]] form alliances with drake turtles and consider them partners in a community.\n\n!! Random Discoveries\n\nWhat might a vessel find if it leaves the sanctioned trade routes\nand ventures into forbidden territories? The table below provides a few possibilities.\n\n| !<<dr d12>> |!Discovery |\n| 1 |What seems to be a powerful storm is actually a [[Lamannia]]n [[manifest zone]] with air [[elemental]]s within its radius. The storm has strong winds and sporadic lightning strikes. |\n| 2 |A [[Lyrandar]] [[elemental galleon]] is drifting on the water. There\u2019s nobody visible on the deck, and no response to signals. |\n| 3 |[[Demonglass|demonglass]] spikes in the water threaten to cripple the ship unless the acting captain succeeds on an attempt to avoid it. There\u2019s a [[sahuagin]] outpost on a stone spire in the center of the field of teeth; they may be willing to assist stranded sailors. |\n| 4 |What at first appears to be a small island is a mass of floating vegetation\u2014sargassum and exotic plants flowing from a [[manifest zone]] tied to [[Lamannia]]. Vines grow at an unnatural rate to entangle a ship that gets too close. Other vessels can be seen trapped deeper in the mass; how long have they been there? Could there be any survivors? |\n| 5 |A [[drake turtle]] surfaces nearby. Is it patrolling on behalf of the [[Eternal Dominion]]? Is it supporting a [[merfolk]] community? Or is it just curious? |\n| 6 |The waters are unnaturally cold, and chunks of ice can be seen ahead. This is a [[manifest zone]] tied to [[Risia]]; icebergs pose danger, but there could be ancient ships\u2014and treasure\u2014trapped in unnatural ice. |\n| 7 |A [[Dominion|Eternal Dominion]] patrol\u2014a [[sahuagin]] baron and a squad of sahuagin using a giant shark as a battle mount\u2014surface and hail your ship. |\n| 8 |A [[demonglass]] spire rises out of the water, but this is no simple spike; it seems to be a ruined temple dating back to the [[Age of Demons]]. |\n| 9 |A ship is anchored at a small, uncharted island. Is this a smuggler\u2019s outpost? Or are the sailors conducting secret negotiations with the local [[sahuagin]]? |\n| 10 |Skeletal fish can be seen in the water around the ship. This is a [[manifest zone]] tied to [[Mabar]]; there may be stronger [[zombie]] beasts in the water, or a shipwreck infested with [[shadow]]s. |\n| 11 |A sudden shift in currents starts pulling the ship towards an immense maelstrom generated by a [[manifest zone]] tied to [[Lamannia]], with water [[elemental]]s in the vicinity. If the ship is pulled in, it might be destroyed... or drawn into the [[Endless Ocean]]|\n| 12 |The hand of a massive statue protrudes from the water, surely made by [[storm giant]]s.
