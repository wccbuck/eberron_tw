!! Gladiator Fight Legalization

[[CENTRAL|Central Plateau]], [[SHARN|Sharn]]—[[Sava Kharisa]], [[Sharn Council]] representative for the [[Lower Central]] ward, said the city should rescind laws forbidding gladiator matches within the city limits. "Today a shadowy network sponsoring pit-fights and other gladiator matches is forced to play hide-and-seek with the city guards," she said. "Certainly our guards have more useful things to do than arrest citizens seeking an evening's leisure. As long as the gladiator matches are safe and the participants are willing, we should give the people of [[Sharn]] what they clearly want," she insisted.

Gladiator matches are forbidden by a variety of anti-gambling, anti-dueling, and anti-bloodsport statutes. Therefore, participants must change the locations of their matches frequently to avoid the [[Sharn Watch]]. Rescinding the statutes, however, would take the agreement of the full [[City Council|Sharn Council]], and such consent may not be forthcoming.

[[Savia Potellas]], who represents the [[Firelight]] district where the famous [[Burning Ring]] matches usually take place, accused [[Kharisa|Sava Kharisa]] of meddling in the affairs of other wards. "It's a known fact that the [[Daask]] gang runs the Burning Ring and a lot of other pit-fighting spectacles. [[Lower Menthis]] has enough problems without the crime that these monster-created bloodsports spawn," she said.

[[Kharisa|Sava Kharisa]] countered that [[Sharn]] already supports several other rough sports and diversions, including [[hrazhak]] and [[skyblade]] events. Therefore, bringing the gladiators out into the open ought to reduce crime, not increase it. "Crime thrives in the darkness," she pointed out. "If we make gladiator matches legal, we shine the light on them. The only reason that organized crime has been so prevalent among the gladiators thus far is that we've forced them to operate outside the law."

Other council members, however, questioned Kharisa's motives. "[[Sava Kharisa]] wants to make bloodsports legal. Her attitude is hardly surprising, given that her cousin was arrested for attending the [[Burning Ring]] just last week," said [[Thurik Davandi]], city council member for [[Upper Menthis]]. "I'm just glad he wasn't arrested for robbery, or we'd have to sit through a speech about why purse-snatching should be legal."

!! Von Harrla Regiment Reunites in Sharn

[[TAVICK'S LANDING|Tavick's Landing]], [[SHARN|Sharn]]—The surviving members of [[Von Harrla's Regiment]] have gathered in [[Sharn]] this week to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Battle of [[Kennrun]].

The regiment, composed of mercenaries who fought for [[Breland]] throughout the latter years of the [[Last War]], was instrumental in Breland's victory at Kennrun. During that battle, the "Gauntlets" prevented three heavy brigades from reinforcing the [[Cyran|Cyre]] lines, enabling the Brelish 21st Cavalry to break through and liberate eastern Breland. The regiment also served with distinction in the [[Graywall|Graywall Mountains]] citadels during the late 980s, and during the "Great Thrust" battles of 992, when [[Breland]] pushed [[Cyran|Cyre]] forces back to the original Breland/Cyre border.

Fewer than two hundred veterans of Von Harrla are alive today because its members were engaged with Cyran forces on the Day of [[Mourning]]. The regiment's standard is among those hanging at Athalus's Tomb in [[Wroat]], dedicated to the Brelish victims of the Day of Mourning.

To commemorate the reunion, King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] issued a royal proclamation declaring the Gauntlets honorary members of the Army of [[Breland]]. This action is highly significant because the regiment's relationship with the regular army was often difficult.

House [[Deneith]], a minority owner in the regiment's contracts throughout the [[Last War]], also plans a ceremonial color guard ceremony in honor of [[Von Harrla's Regiment]] next Sul. On that day, Deneith soldiers across [[Breland]] will wear red gloves in honor of these brave veterans.

"The ceremonies and proclamations are appreciated," said Von Harrla Sergeant Darius Pike. "But the reunion is more about remembering the Gauntlets who never returned from [[Cyre]] in 994. I survived only because I was assigned recruiting duty in the winter of 993—an assignment I didn't particularly want.

"I used to know the thirty guys in my platoon better than their own families did," Pike said. "And my whole company was like family to me. Only three of those guys are still around. So we'll hoist a tankard for the other one hundred forty-odd brothers who are out there in the [[mist|dead-gray mists]] somewhere."

!! Dozens Claim to Have Seen Lantern-Bearer of Keshaware

[[DURA|Dura]], [[SHARN|Sharn]]—The mysterious—and some say folkloric—figure known as the Lantern-Bearer of Keshaware has been seen in [[Sharn]] this week at least four times, eyewitnesses said.

“He had these dirty white robes, a long gray beard, and tousled hair,” said Maretha Ducain, a cobbler from the [[Underlook]] district. “The lantern was covered in jewels—so much so that the jewels themselves seemed to be glowing. And just like in the woodcarvings, he has the lantern on the end of a staff, and he walks all bent over.”

Tales of the Lantern-Bearer of Keshaware are at least centuries old, said Charral Meers, a professor of history at [[Morgrave University]].

“It’s said that the original Lantern-Bearer was Keshaware, [[Lhazaar]]’s navigator some three thousand years ago. When Lhazaar discovered [[Khorvaire]], she wanted to establish a settlement right away. But Keshaware wanted to explore the whole continent,” he said.

“The folklore gets a little unclear at this point, but somehow Keshaware gets his wish—or he’s cursed. He won’t die until the light of his lantern has shined on every part of Khorvaire,” he said.

Meers noted that about two centuries ago, Keshaware became a popular subject for painters and other artists, probably because he can be depicted amid any landscape, and he brings his own light source with him.

That’s when the name got twisted around, from Keshaware, the bearer of the lantern, to the Bearer of the Lantern of Keshaware, to the Lantern-Bearer of Keshaware, Meers said.

Meers noted that about fifty years ago, [[Karrnath]] had a spate of Keshaware sightings—but the lantern-bearer was a young woman.

“These Karrnath sightings were probably a hoax of some sort, but there’s another possible explanation,” Meers said.

“It might be that the lantern itself holds the power, or the curse, or what have you. Maybe the lantern-bearer can pass on Keshaware’s legacy by giving the lantern to someone else, who then walks around [[Khorvaire]], unable to die,” he said.
