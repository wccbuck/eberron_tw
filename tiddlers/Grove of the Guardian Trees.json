Deep within the [[Towering Wood]], a region exists where\ngrowth is truly phenomenal: the grove of the\nGuardian Trees. The Guardian Trees dwarf the greatest\nredwoods, and a wide variety of [[dire beast]]s inhabit the\nrealm beneath the dizzying heights of the canopy. The\nGuardian Trees extend for thirty miles in all directions\nand shelter a number of [[druid]] and [[shifter]] communities,\nincluding [[Greenheart]]. Many [[druid]]s seek solace and meditate within the shelter of these giant trees.\n\nSome say that the Guardian Trees are not only [[awaken]]ed\nlike the Great Druid [[Oalian]] but were once the elder [[druid]]s\nof the [[Age of Monsters]]. Others believe that the place and\nits trees are simply ancient growths from the time before\ntime began, when the world was different and new. Whatever the truth, the place teems\nwith old magic and ancient life.
