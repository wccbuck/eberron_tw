The links of this chain mail have been stained to create the optical illusion that you are wearing a brown-and-russet feathered tunic. While you wear this armor, your attempts involving making performances with an instrument have [[advantage]]. Additionally, when you play an instrument, all creatures of your choosing who can hear you may become [[charm]]ed by you for up to 1 minute.
