Long before [[human]]s came to [[Stormreach]], this fallen tower was built by [[giant]]s.\nParts of it project above the street, but most of the old\nbuilding is buried. Five years ago, the catacombs were\noverrun by [[undead]]. Many of them were destroyed, but\nenough remained that the [[lower levels|Undercity]] were sealed with\nwards and stone to contain the evil, and the upper levels\nwere abandoned. Secrets remain in the catacombs for\nthose prepared to brave the darkness.\n\n[[Yannick Drumdoom]] can often be found here, endlessly reciting the names of the dead.",
