        "text": "For thirty generations, the people of [[Io'lokar]] have lived and died within their city\nwalls. At the end of a nondescript lane in the [[Terrace]], an unlocked black\nonyx gate opens to a well-worn spiral staircase leading\ndown into the mountain.\n\nAlong miles of magically carved corridors stand the burial chambers of the [[Io'lokari]]. Their placement follows no pattern; old and new tombs can be found side by\nside throughout the complex. No map or plan of these\ncaverns exists—the Io’lokari who come here to meditate\nknow where their loved ones lie.\n\nThough few contemporary city folk have ever explored the full extents of the necropolis, it is rumored that its thousand-year-old caverns connect to\nan even older series of caves where the remains of great\n[[dragon]]s are entombed. If this draconic ossuary has\nany connection to the [[Warders]]’ placing [[Io'lokar]] here, it\nremains unknown.",
