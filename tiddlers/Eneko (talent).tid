As an [[eneko]], you gain the following benefits. Note that this [[talent]] costs two [[experience point]]s.

* Gain +1 [[impact]] when performing feats of strength or athletics.
* Gain an additional [[harm]] box.
* You are resistant to [[fire damage|damage type]]. You are also acclimated to hot climates and aren't adversely affected by extreme heat.
** Alternatively, if you are one of the [[pathadrik]] mountainfolk of [[Adar]], or perhaps have the blood of [[frost giant]]s in your veins, you can replace this benefit with a resistance to [[cold damage|damage type]], and an acclimation to cold climates.
