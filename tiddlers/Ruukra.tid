title: Ruukra
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This [[oni]] is an imposing sight, ten feet of
muscle sheathed in chainmail. Her skin is icy blue, and
her horns are glistening black ivory. Ruukra is especially
devoted to the [[Path of Inspiration]] and the belief that
through good works, she can purify the [[demon]] within.
She is dedicated to honor and grace, and when she is off the battlefield
she goes out of her way to show compassion to others. In
battle, she acts with honorâ€”she shows no mercy to those
she believes to be tools of evil, but she will not condone
unnecessary cruelty among her companions. Although
brave, she is a wise warrior and knows when to retreat to
fight another day. If she is seriously injured, she typically
turns invisible and takes to the air, staying out of her
enemy's reach while she regenerates. As with all members
of the [[Horned Guard]], she has been forbidden from using
her //change shape// power. The priests say that the body of the
[[oni]] is designed to hold the //altavar//, and changing
shape weakens those bonds and lets the spirit influence
the individual. 

Ruukra can be encountered on the borders of [[Adar]],
or as a guardian of the peace in a [[bastion city]]. She initially opposes the PCs, but if they act with honor, she might come to respect them. Ruukra is violently opposed
to the [[Horned Shadow]], and a joint battle against the
Shadow could easily cement a bond between her and the
PCs. Eventually, she might come to realize that the PCs
are more honorable than her [[Inspired]] masters. Although
she will never abandon the [[Path of Inspiration]], she could
turn against the Inspired.

Despite her fearsome appearance, Ruukra is calm and
compassionate. She never lets anger show, even in battle.
She pities her opponents rather than hating them.
