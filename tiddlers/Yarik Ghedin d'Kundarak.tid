Viceroy [[Korbek Ghedin d'Kundarak]] is almost never encountered without his bodyguard Yarik, a hulking brick of a [[dwarf]] clad in [[mithral]] plate. Nobody knows just what
Yarik’s title or role is (aside from guarding Korbek), but some dwarves whisper of his connection to House [[Kundarak]]’s paramilitary arm, the [[Ghorad'din]].
