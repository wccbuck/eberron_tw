Murephan is an enigma. Born as the result of some
heinous crime against the [[Inspired]], and once one of
the [[Chosen]] of [[Riedra]], he is a permanent amalgam of
[[quori]] spirit and [[human]] flesh. He came to Adar long
ago—even he doesn't know how long—without memories
or possessions. He expected to die. But the [[kalashtar]] of
[[Malshashar]] slowly influenced Murephan even as they
imprisoned him, and his suppressed hatred for the
[[Inspired]] resurfaced. He began to work for the [[Summit Road]] and now spends much of his time in [[Syrkarn]], helping others out of situations all too familiar to him. The
ranger and [[psion]] has proven his loyalty and ability
time and again, but his race keeps him eternally an outsider. Only in the city-hive [[Zi'til'natek]] does he find any true company.

Murephan is hard-nosed, and he speaks unkind
truths more often than he should, but he is fair-minded
overall. His gruffness is perfect for testing others'
patience, which means it can be an asset in the risky business he's in. He is less likely to carry out threats of abandoning those he aids than he seems. He is, however,
a merciless killer of [[Riedrans]], and he's likely to give
anyone who attacks him a good thrashing. His closest
friend is the [[dromite]] [[Kelki]], who doubles as Murephan's
soft side.
