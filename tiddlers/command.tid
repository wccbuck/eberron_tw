type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within 60 feet. If the target cannot resist your magical imperative, they must follow the command. The spell has no effect if the target is [[undead]], if it doesn't understand your [[language]], or if your command is directly harmful to it.

Some typical commands follow, though you might issue a command other than one described here. If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends.

* ''Approach''. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route.
* ''Drop''. The target drops whatever it is holding.
* ''Flee''. The target moves away from you by the fastest available means.
* ''Grovel''. The target drops to the ground and lies face down.
* ''Halt''. The target stops moving.
