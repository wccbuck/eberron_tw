''Ruler:'' High King [[Shaeras Vadallia]]<br/>
''Population:'' <<ntls>>

The [[elves|elf]] of [[Valenar]] have little love for cities, but
they recognize that their nation and their king require
a capital. Taer Valaestas is a walled city built with
military precision. The wall surrounding the city is
a massive thicket of [[bronzewood]] thorns. Its wide streets are designed to allow mobility of mounted [[Tairnadal]] warbands, and its buildings are constructed of stone and dense wood for strength and resistance to fire.

High King [[Shaeras Vadallia]] maintains his seat in Taer
Valaestas. Though unimpressive by the standards of other nations, the royal palace is the
most ostentatious structure in Valenar. High King
Vadallia’s quarters are austere, but the palace’s regal
courtyard with its towering columns evokes memories of the forests of [[Aerenal]] and the great city of [[Shae Cairdal]].

In addition to the royal palace, outposts of most [[dragonmarked house]]s, and a [[market|Peasants' Market]] where foreigners sell their wares, Taer Valaestas hosts the primary [[temple|Temple of the Ages]] of the [[Keepers of the Past|Spirits of the Past]] and a vast arena used for horse training, races, and other displays of equestrian skill.

!! Entering the City

As travelers approach the [[bronzewood]] walls of Taer Valaestas overland, they are sure to encounter a warband of soldiers with their faces hidden behind veils, indicating they are ready for battle, and ensuring the glory of their victory will pass to their patron champion. These sentinels demand to know the business of any adventurers in the seat of the Darkwood Crown, as well as the details of their journey across their land. One can answer this challenge with steel, or with words, spinning compelling tales of their own great deeds. The simplest approach is honesty and humility.

!! The People of Taer Valaestas

!!! Elves
The [[Tairnadal]] are nomads and warriors, with no love for sedate urban life. Elf warriors found on the streets are typically on active police duty or else have come in pursuit of a specific goal: acquiring a new weapon, seeking aid for a sick horse, searching for religious guidance, or something similar. But a few elves are settled within the city.

The [[Keepers of the Past|Spirits of the Past]] perform religious duties and tend to the spiritual needs of the people. While most [[Tairnadal]] children are raised on [[Aerenal]], the Keepers also tend to the education of the young. The [[Siyal Marrain]] are [[elf]] [[druid]]s; while some assist with the defense of the city, their primary duty is to care for the [[horses|Valenar beast]] raised and quartered in this place, and to help match horse to rider. Finally, the most numerous of the settled elves are the //zaelantar//, [[Tairnadal]] artisans whose honored ancestors were crafters as opposed to soldiers. These elves work with teams of [[human]]s and [[Khoravar|half-elf]], producing weapons, armor, and other goods for the Host of [[Valenar]]. While some of the zaelantar are fledgling artisans who hope to prove their skills in the new land, others are among the finest smiths and laborers of the [[Valaes Tairn]]. The best of them are rarely interested in selling their services to outsiders... however, someone who earns the respect or favor of a Valenar smith could gain access to goods or services of far greater quality than the size of the city would suggest.

Elves of other cultures live and work in Taer Valaestas. [[Phiarlan]] entertainers, [[Aereni]] sailors, and traders from the [[Five Nations]] all work or wander in the marketplace. Such elves are generally treated with more respect than members of other races, but any [[Valenar]] soldier can still call them to account for themselves.

Whether priest, druid, artisan, or soldier, the [[Tairnadal]] lead ascetic, martial lives. As such, few of the Valenar maintain private residences. Soldiers are billeted in one of the garrisons spread around the city, but usually only return to eat, meditate, or spar. [[Keepers of the Past|Spirits of the Past]] live in the temple known as the [[Cenotaph|Temple of the Ages]], which stands next to the Darkwood Palace. The [[Siyal Marrain]] camp among their herds in the Green Quarter, while the zaelantar live in the buildings where they do their work.

!!! Khoravar

While [[half-elves|half-elf]] have been in the region since the destruction of the line of [[Vol]], most of the Khoravar of Taer Valaestas have migrated to the region since the [[Valenar]] claim 40 years ago. A significant portion of the half-elves of Taer Valaestas work in some capacity for House [[Lyrandar]]. The house has transferred much of the administration of the [[Windwrights Guild]] to its [[enclave]] in Taer Valaestas, along with the top arcane researchers of [[Lyran's Gift]], and have established a shipyard just outside the [[Redwater River]].

The [[Valaes Tairn]] have little interest in urban administration, and over the course of the last four decades House [[Lyrandar]] has assumed control over the municipal tasks of most major cities. Agents of Lyrandar oversee taxation and assistance, monitor matters of agriculture, and administer justice to the lower echelons. Viceroy Shyrrala d'Lyrandar is often seen seated alongside the [[High King|Shaeras Vadallia]] himself at dinners at the Darkwood Palace.

Not all of the [[half-elves|half-elf]] work for the House of Storms. House [[Medani]] has increased its presence in recent years, and Viceroy Jolan has become fast friends with the High King; the viceroy wants to ensure that the Khoravar of Valenar don't end up being tools of [[Lyrandar]] ambition. Other half-elves have no ties to either of the houses, and they have simply traveled across [[Khorvaire]] to be part of the Khoravar community. Some seek to emulate the [[Valenar]], while others see this as an opportunity for a true homeland for their people. Most are artisans working under zaelantar artisans, while a few have become farmers.

Khoravar can be found throughout the city, but most live in or around the [[Lyrandar]] [[enclave]] in the eastern quarter. Their homes are typically a mix of [[densewood]] buildings in the [[Aereni]] style and the baked clay structures of the khunan [[human]]s.

!!! Humans

If a [[human]] of the [[Five Nations]] sought to trace their ancestors back to [[Sarlona]], they'd likely find a trail leading to the ancient kingdom of [[Rhiavhaar]] or [[Nulakesh]]. The rituals performed in [[Sharn]]'s [[Pavilion of the Host]] were born in the [[Sarlona]]n nation of [[Pyrine]]. The humans of [[Valenar]]—the people of Taer Valaestas—come from different stock. Their ancestors came from [[Khunan]] in modern [[Syrkarn]], fleeing fierce magewars and the coming of the [[Inspired]]. Where the people of [[Galifar]] have let go of their Sarlonan past, the khunan folk of Valenar hold fast to the traditions of their ancestors. The [[Cyrans|Cyre]] forced the [[Common]] tongue upon them, but you can still hear the old language of [[Khunan]] spoken in the taverns of Taer Valaestas, and find makeshift shrines to unfamiliar deities scattered about. They are not as unified in their ways as the people of [[Aundair]] or [[Thrane]]; in wider Valenar, every village has its own unique traditions, and those who have come to Taer Valaestas have brought all of these customs together. But every khunan takes pride in the past of their family.

Khunans live in the farming communities that ring Taer Valaestas, and they labor in the orchards and rooftop gardens within the city walls. Most of the menial work in the city is performed by khunan laborers; someone has to clean the manure. While you might expect this to breed bitterness and resentment, many of the khunan people seem more optimistic than angry; what anger is there is usually directed at the people or the west (whom they call the "thrones"), or more locally, the [[Khoravar|half-elf]] immigrants who are sometimes seen as stealing opportunities that would otherwise fall into [[human]] hands.

The khunans have largely held to their traditional architecture, which uses bricks of baked clay. While the [[Khoravar|half-elf]] have brought the traditional faiths of the [[Five Nations]] to [[Valenar]], the khunan people have their own religions, including a form of ancestor worship not unlike that of the [[Tairnadal]], though tied to [[human]] spirits and more peaceful in nature. No love is lost between the khunans and the people of the Five Nations; [[Cyrans|Cyre]] in particular would be wise to keep their homeland to themselves.

While the khunan people form the bulk of the human population and the labor force, there are also [[human]]s from other lands, including merchants and ambassadors. While there is little need for [[Deneith]] mercenaries in Taer Valaestas, the house does a considerable amount of business with [[Vadallia|Shaeras Vadallia]], and it has a small but luxurious [[enclave]]. House [[Cannith]] has established an outpost, undoubtedly offering weapons of war to the king and seeking to draw on the skills of his zaelantar. House [[Vadalis]] is notable in its absence, and would-be horse thieves are publicly executed in gruesome displays. And while the other [[Thronehold]] nations haven't been allowed to build individual consulates, each maintains offices and quarters in the Distant Palace, a large building in the western quarter of the city.

!!! Other Races

Most of the other races found in Taer Valaestas are drawn by business. [[Dwarves|dwarf]] maintain the [[Kundarak]] vault, and [[Mror|Mror Holds]] lords negotiate the prices of ore and jewels. A [[Sivis]] [[message tower|speaking stone]] carries messages on the wind. Most numerous are the [[halfling]]s, since the population includes employees of [[Jorasco]] and [[Ghallanda]] along with native halflings who migrated south from the [[Talenta Plains]] long before the elves arrived. But the foreign population is relatively small. While Taer Valaestas serves a center for trade and diplomacy, it is also a fortress, and High King [[Vadallia|Shaeras Vadallia]] has no desire to allow a fifth column to grow within the walls of his city. This has also resulted in a hostile attitude toward [[changeling]]s, due to their natural talent for espionage; changelings passing through Taer Valaestas would do well to be wary.

!! The Law in Taer Valaestas

In Taer Valaestas, and indeed in all of [[Valenar]], there are two forces of law: the [[Tairnadal]] military and the civilian justiciars. Mounted soldiers patrol the major roads, and stealthy rangers hide in the shadows, hoping to find challenging prey. However, needless cruelty and unnecessary violence are frowned upon. The city is a military fortress, and the soldiers of the [[Valaes Tairn]] are expected to maintain order. As long as you don't start any trouble, you are likely left alone.

The soldiers do an excellent job of bringing a swift and decisive end to any violence or obvious crime. However, they have little interest in hearing civilian disputes. The justiciars handle these matters. While the justiciars are technically civil servants, House [[Lyrandar]] appoints them, and that the [[inquisitive]] arm of the department includes many heirs of House [[Medani]]; with the exception of a few zaelantar diplomats and mediators, all of the justiciars are [[half-elves|half-elf]]. The justiciars hear pleas and conduct investigations. In purely civil cases, the justiciars are authorized to set punishments and dispense justice. If the matter involves members of the [[Valenar]] host, a zaelantar mediator discusses the matter with the officers of the warclan in question.

All [[Valaes Tairn]] stand above civilian law and are governed by military hierarchy; a //thaliaen// is expected to maintain order among his troops, and a thaliaen can be disciplined only by an officer of //raethalast// or higher rank. There is no assurance of justice in a case involving a Valenar soldier, but if an officer feels that the soldier was at fault (most likely because he dishonored his ancestor) or that the incident has a chance of causing considerable unrest, they may punish the soldier or order reparations to maintain goodwill. However, [[Valenar]] does not operate under the [[Code of Galifar]]. There is no presumption of innocence and no trial by jury. If a [[Tairnadal]] soldier has the blessing of his commanders, he may act as he deems necessary with no fear of the consequences.

Violent crime is met with violence. Otherwise, a lucky foreigner may be fined and exiled from the land via the first ship leaving for the west. Criminals who draw less sympathy from the justiciars may be scarred, maimed, or executed in a colorful manner, depending on the severity of the crime. Incarceration is rarely used as a form of punishment.

!! Adventure Hooks

* When the PCs explain their business to the sentinel warband outside the [[bronzewood]] gates, one of the rangers is inspired by the tale. She asks if she can accompany the party in the city, serving as guide and fighting at their side if need be. This could be just as it seems, in which case she could be a valuable ally who can defuse conflicts with other locals. But she could have a hidden agenda. Is she a [[dragon]] of the [[Chamber]], hoping to observe the party to see if they are the ones spoken of in the [[Prophecy|Draconic Prophecy]]? A [[Lord of Dust|Lords of Dust]] laying the groundwork for a distant scheme? Or a niece of the [[High King|Shaeras Vadallia]] himself—a woman with noble intent, but one whose friendship could prove both valuable and extremely dangerous?
* Any [[half-elf]] who comes to Taer Valaestas receives a warm welcome from other Khoravar, including invitations to meals with neighborhood communities. This is a way for the half-elf to learn about current events and possible adventures. If the half-elf has relatives in the city—a strong possibility considering the growth of Khoravar immigration —their kin may ask them for help with family troubles.
* [[Lyrandar]] heirs are being murdered on the streets of Taer Valaestas. Viceroy Shyralla believes House [[Medani]] is trying to break her growing influence in the city, and she intends to take vengeance against Jolan d'Medani. The PCs' role depends on the house to which they have ties. If they are Medani, they must expose the true culprit before the war cripples both houses. If they are Lyrandar, they may be employed in strikes against Medani. And if they have no connection to either house, they may simply be caught in the middle of the deadly Khoravar feud.
* Jhaer Varedi is the finest swordsmith in Taer Valaestas, a living legend among the [[Valaes Tairn]]. He has come to [[Khorvaire]] to fulfill a vision, which he believes has been handed down from his patron ancestor —the creation of a weapon that will change the course of history, a blade for a great champion. To identify the one worthy to bear the blade, he has set up a series of tests... and he has chosen to let both [[Khoravar|half-elf]] and [[khunan|human]] compete alongside [[Valenar]] warriors. If an [[elf]] PC wins the challenges, they gain great recognition among the host. If a [[human]] or [[half-elf]] wins, she has the opportunity to raise the status of her people in the eyes of the [[Tairnadal]]. But any victor could make many enemies in the process. And what is the destiny of the blade itself? Is Jhaer's prophecy true—or is a [[dragon]], [[rakshasa]], or [[quori]] behind his visions?
* [[Khunan]] was the birthplace of the sinister [[yuan-ti]]. Is it possible that some of these creatures could have slipped across the [[Sea of Rage]] with the other refugees? And if so, what powers have they amassed in the intervening centuries? Could a yuan-ti replace Viceroy Shyralla d'[[Lyrandar]] or even High King [[Vadallia|Shaeras Vadallia]] himself? Could this have happened already... in which case the seemingly provocative behavior of [[Valenar]] troops may be the opening gambit of a far more sinister game?
