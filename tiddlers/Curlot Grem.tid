Curlot Grem is a broad-shouldered man of 55 years. He served at [[Sterngate]] during the [[Last War]], and often boasts about his service. Curlot wears armor that he decorates flamboyantly in patriotic accessories, and often wears a cap (or helmet) to cover his growing bald spot. He owns a livery and stable in [[Mistmarsh]].

Curlot is known to be a little eccentric. He can frequently be heard telling long-winded and embellished stories while using grandiose words he seems not to understand; he also enjoys dressing up his horses in quirky and colorful costumes during town festivals. Youths in Mistmarsh have played harmless pranks on him and his place of business for nearly two decades. However, Curlot is a good sport, and wheeze-laughs along with them.

Curlot trained young [[Arien Grimbold]] in the sword before she set off to serve at [[Sterngate]] during her teenage years.


!! During the [[Reavers of Harkenwold|The Reavers of Harkenwold]] Adventure

Curlot's reputation as a fool has shielded him from scrutiny by agents the [[Iron Circle]]. He is the primary leader of the growing rebellion against the [[Iron Circle]] in [[Harkenwold]], having meticulously organized a network of runners and scouts to keep in touch with the villages surrounding [[Mistmarsh]]. He's not about to let a few brigands ruin his home.

Curlot uses his business, Grem Stables, as his base of operations. Under cover of stabling their mounts, locals arrive and depart regularly, reporting Iron Circle movements and carrying messages to rebel leaders in other towns.

Curlot believes that the only way to beat the [[Iron Circle]] is to bait [[Nazin Redthorn]] into marching out of his [[keep|Harken Keep]] to fight a major battle. To convince Nazin that the rebellion must be crushed, he needs Arien to raid and harass [[Iron Circle]] supply lines and patrols throughout [[Harkenwold]]. See the encounter "<<navAndScrollToHeader "The Reavers of Harkenwold" "Waylay the Caravan">>."

Questions and answers:

* ''How to help with the resistance?'' "If we're going to beat the Iron Circle, we've got to draw [[Redthorn|Nazin Redthorn]] out of his keep. We need to get him angry. There's a supply caravan heading out to [[Dry Rise]] tomorrow—you could attack it! Heck, just picking a fight with Iron Circle goons in any tavern in Harkenwold would be a good start!"
* ''How big is the Iron Circle army?'' "Redthorn's got about four hundred soldiers—a bunch in [[Harkenton]], the rest scattered throughout the county. When I call for the rebels to gather, I hope to gather a bit more than that. We can take 'em, but we're going to have to work together."
* ''Why don't we just storm Redthorn's keep?'' "Oho, you're a bold one! It'll be a lot easier to draw Redthorn out than to go in after him."
* ''My mom said to fight the Toadwallow bullywugs first.'' "Aye, that'd be a great help too! We can use the [[Tor's Hold]] lads and lasses, and those croakers are causing 'em no end of trouble. Not to mention us! It's hard to go west without running into those cursed things. If you deal with that first, swing back around. I'll still have work for you!"
