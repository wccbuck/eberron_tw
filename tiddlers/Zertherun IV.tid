Zertherun IV is one of the monastery vessels of the [[githzerai|gith]], floating in the [[Sea of Chaos]] in [[Kythri]]. It's under the guidance of the [[Serene Azera]], whose mental discipline maintains the stability of the ship. The Alazerth [[Elemon]] is a senior monk charged with dealing with outsiders.

[[Kythri]]'s [[Broken Rhythms]] property doesn't apply in a githzerai monastery, and while [[Constant Change]] exists, its effects are minimized. Zertherun IV maintains
capacitors for change, such as gardens of small stones and
engraved wheels with shifting patterns, which absorb the
energies of change and prevent it from transforming the vessel.
