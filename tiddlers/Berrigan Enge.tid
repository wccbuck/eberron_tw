A distant cousin of the [[Wylkes family]], Berrigan Enge has secured a profitable position aiding the [[Harbor Lord|Jonas Wylkes]] in dealing with duty on goods making their way from the harbor to marketâ€”a position that affords him many opportunities to
skim some coin for himself. Berrigan takes a very
hands-on approach to his job, preferring to hire
help only on rare occasions. He is often seen at the
[[Harbormaster's House]].
