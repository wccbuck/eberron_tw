        "text": "The [[Grim Lord|Grim Lords]] Varonaean is an ancient [[lich]] of [[Farlnen]]. Also known as \"the Gardener of Farlnen\", he is the botanist who designed many plants that thrive in shadows rather than sunlight, and can therefore survive on the stony [[Mabar]]-touched island. The fruits of his labors can be seen today: [[ebon sedge]] and a darkness-drinking form of [[darkwood]] trees are only a few of his inventions. Varonaen has continued his work over the course of generations, and the merchants of Farlnen trade spices and wines that cannot be produced anyÂ­where else in the world.",
