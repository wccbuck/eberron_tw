type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

An adult [[silver dragon]] with great arcane skill, Yllosavax is interested in those paths of the [[Draconic Prophecy]] whose branches fork at various [[arcane discoveries|arcane theory]] among the lesser races. Initially content to observe, she has begun to nudge [[wizard]]s and researchers of the [[Five Nations]] in specific directions. Although she believes that she pursues the best interests of [[Eberron]], she is increasingly tempted to push events in directions most beneficial to her own ambitions. To date, she has managed to reconcile these two conflicting goalsâ€”or at least, she believes that she has.

If she is cornered by hostile forces, Yllosavax will use her [[enchantment]] magic to cause her enemies to fight each other, and then escape under the cover of a [[fog cloud]].
