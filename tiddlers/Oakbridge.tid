While the majority of the townhouses and apartments
in Oakbridge fall into the “average” category, they
are of the highest quality within that category. The
district is not ostentatious and an Oakbridge address
conveys no status on its owner, but the buildings are
large, well constructed, and very safe, and the inhabitants are friendly and always keep an eye out for one
another. If someone purchases a home in Oakbridge,
within a week he has dozens of new friends.
