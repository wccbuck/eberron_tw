The primary clerk who deals with suspicious individuals in the [[Tower of Law]] in [[Upper Tavick's Landing]], [[Sharn]], is an old [[dwarf]] named [[Billan Tosh]]. Billan is an expert at spotting forgeries. He also has a pair of spectacles that provide him with the benefits of [[truesight]], and if he detects any use of magic he triggers an alarm summoning guardsâ€”so the use of magical charms might backfire. Billan is a low-level member of the [[Aurum]], and the character's relationship with the Aurum may affect their ability to acquire licenses; alternatively, he can offer to grant a request if the characters perform a service for the Aurum. Because of his Aurum connections, he proves difficult to bribe; he is well paid for his services.
