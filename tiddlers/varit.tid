Varit is a distinctive beverage found across the fortress-cities of [[Adar]]. It is a powerful tonic made from infusing pure water with a liquid form of [[sentira]] that conveys a pure emotion, such as joy. Pure varit is quite intense, so it is usually watered down or enjoyed in very small quantities; a few drops of joy in one's morning tea is enough to start the day with a smile. While Adaran varit is usually distilled from positive feelings, some distilleries (such as in the town of [[Raan]]) specialize in sorrow.

Varit is a rare and exotic beverage in [[Khorvaire]], though one may find distilleries in [[Adaran]] communities, such as [[Overlook]] in [[Sharn]]. 

The [[orc]]s of the [[Shadow Marches]] have a traditional practice of brewing an herbal tea known as [[gaeth'ad]], which can have emotion-manipulating effects similar to those of dilute varit.
