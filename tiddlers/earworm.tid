To attune to this [[symbiont]], you must hold it against the skin behind your ear for several minutes, whereupon it burrows into your head and bonds to your skull. While the earworm is inside you, you can speak, read, and write [[Deep Speech]]. You can also detect the thoughts of those around you a few times per day, and each time you do this, the earworm sends the information gleaned to the nearest [[daelkyr]], or to the next nearest earworm until it reaches a daelkyr.
