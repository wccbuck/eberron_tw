Different from the rest of town, the windows are glassed and a fading layer of white paint had been applied to the walls. The crumbling paint reveals the usual blackened wood beneath.//\n\nThe current Obom (mayor and judge) of [[Dhavin's Post]] is a [[half-orc]] named Koman. He lives in the mansion that traditionally belongs to the Obom. Due to some irregularities during the last election nine years ago, Koman still lives in the mansion and intends to keep it that way. The Obom revels in jewelry and displays of martial might. He carries a longsword and a shortsword wherever he goes; privy included. He also wears several golden chains, earrings, and rings. Koman has a younger sister named Robimor who was blessed with the [[Mark of Finding]].\n\nOn the ground level, the mansion features a spacious\nfestival hall where the Obom prefers to take his dinner. On\nother occasions, the room is opened to the public to feast and\ncelebrate. A kitchen, several rooms for the attendants, and\nadministrative offices can also be found on the ground floor.\n\nThe first floor is reserved for the Obom himself. Here, one\ncan find a luxurious lounge, a spacious bed chamber, and the\nObomâ€™s personal office. A dungeon and the barracks are located\nin the cellar.",
