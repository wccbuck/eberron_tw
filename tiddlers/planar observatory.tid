A planar observatory is a structure at the heart of the [[Chamber]]'s efforts to divine the meaning of the [[Draconic Prophecy]]. The observatory consists of great chambers
of crystal and metal, lined with huge orreries that track
and align with the planes and the Ring of [[Siberys]]. 

These immense locations are constructed by and
for [[dragon]]s. The orreries that surround the central
space track the courses of the planes as they shift toward and away from Eberron. All about the observatory
are enormous [[dragonshard]]s of all three kinds (Eberron,
Khyber, and Siberys).

Each observatory must be built in a location that is
balanced between [[Siberys]] and [[Khyber]]; finding such a
site might take years of careful study and surveying, and
these places are typically remote. Several are located
in [[Argonnessen]]; those in [[Khorvaire]] are usually found
in mountain ranges and hidden forest clearings. Many
have crystal roofs, or domes that open with the aid of
great mechanisms to allow an unobstructed view of
the night sky, since the movements of Eberron's moons
are thought to correspond to the shifting relationships
among the planes.
