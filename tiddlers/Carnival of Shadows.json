        "text": "The best-known performance work of the [[Entertainers and Artisans Guild]], and House [[Phiarlan]] in general, is the Carnival of Shadows, which is a traveling circus that combines [[illusion]], physical arts, and exotic [[beast]]s from across [[Eberron]]. Three separate companies of the Carnival of Shadows migrate between the major cities of [[Khorvaire]], and they reach even the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] and the [[Talenta Plains]]. \n\nFrom an adventuring perspective, the carnival offers a variety of hooks. To begin with, agents of the [[Serpentine Table]] often travel with the Carnival of Shadows; this could result in adventurers coming into conflict with [[Phiarlan]] schemes when the circus comes to town, or it could mean that PCs working with the house are sent to join the carnival. The beasts that travel with the circus can also pose a challenge; an escaped monster could wreak havoc on a city, or adventurers could find themselves hired to capture an exotic creature in [[Xen'drik]] and transport it—alive—back to [[Khorvaire]].",
