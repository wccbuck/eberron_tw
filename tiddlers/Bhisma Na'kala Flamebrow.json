He joined King [[Sebastes ir'Kesslan]] to represent [[Q'barra]] at the [[Treaty of Thronehold]] two years ago, and continues to advocate for peace.\n\nBhisma has called upon the [[dragonborn]] clans to hold to their ancient duties, and forbids attacks on [[human]] towns. But Bhismaâ€™s authority is far from absolute, and even those who respect his words will still butcher outsiders who trespass onto the unhallowed grounds that the dragonborn protect.",
