        "text": "The First Night, also known as the Covenant, is the [[demiplane]] where the thirteen original [[night hag]]s were formed at the dawn of time, and is where their essences reform when they are killed. The exception is Sora Ghazra, whose essence splintered into her killers as a nightmare curse that transformed them into lesser night hags; these hags carried the curse to infect another generation of Ghazra's brood when killed, and so the cycle continues.\n\nThere is no [[overlord]] in the First Night, but it acts much as a heart [[demiplane]] for the primal [[night hag]]s. The demiplane embodies mortal fears of nightmares, of unknown forces lurking in the darkness, and perhaps the cruel curiosity of [[Khyber]] itself.\n\n",
