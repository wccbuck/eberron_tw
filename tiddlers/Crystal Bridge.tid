While many of the most influential citizens of [[Sharn]]
prefer to live in [[Upper Central]], closer to the center of
government and trade, Crystal Bridge is home to many
of Sharn's wealthiest denizens. A number of [[dragonmark]]ed heirs maintain private residences in Crystal Bridge or [[Oak Towers]], along with [[Brelish|Breland]] aristocrats
and merchant princes. Crystal Towers is a quiet,
peaceful district, and many of its inhabitants employ
private guards to ensure that it remains peaceful.
