type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Middle Menthis boasts the most diverse population of
any ward in [[Sharn]]. The [[Little Plains]] district is the destination for [[halfling]] immigrants from the [[Talenta Plains]].
[[Cassan Bridge]] has a significant population of [[orc]]s and
[[half-orc]]s from the [[Shadow Marches]]. Immigrants from
the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] have settled in the [[Warden Towers]] district, which is primarily a garrison for the
[[Sharn Watch]]. The district of [[Smoky Towers]] had a significant [[Cyran|Cyre]] community even before the [[Last War]];
now, this area has become a haven for Cyrans wealthy
enough to escape the refugee camps of [[High Walls]].

One of the most prominent attractions In Smoky Towers is the [[Classic Theater]]. The place lives up to its name
by staging only traditional works written before the start
of the Last War. Although the [[Grand Stage]] in the [[University District]] also performs more recent works echoing the classical style, the Classic has a stated policy of
not even considering new works.

The [[Everbright]] district might be of particular interest
to adventurers. A wide assortment of [[magewright]]s ply
their trade here, and the shops have a good selection
of [[magic item]]s (of common and uncommon rarity). The
people of Middle Menthis are law-abiding folk; visitors
looking for spellcasters to help with illegal activities or
who want to sell stolen artifacts will likely have better
luck in [[Lower Dura]]. 

!! Districts and Noteworthy Locations

* [[Everbright]]. This district is a source of magical goods and services. Exotic components, [[magewright]]s for hire, common or uncommon [[magic item]]sâ€”all of these and more can be found here.
* [[Little Plains]]. Founded by [[Talenta|Talenta Plains]] [[halfling]]s, this district includes a central campground for visiting halfling nomads. The permanent residents are mostly halflings as well. Talentan foods and crafts can be found here, along with displays of traditional skills and pastimes. 
* [[Smoky Towers]]. Safer than the lower wards and less expensive than [[Upper Menthis]], Smoky Towers has plenty of entertainment options. The [[Classic Theater]] is its most popular venue, but Smoky Towers offers a wide variety of more exotic fare. Dinner theater, [[changeling]] burlesque, and other diversions can be found in Smoky Towers. [[Thovanic Hall]] has begun performing works from [[Darguun]] and [[Droaam]] featuring monstrous performers. Smoky Towers has also become a haven for [[Cyran|Cyre]] refugees wealthy enough to avoid [[High Walls]]. 
** [[Classic Theater]]. A small and inexpensive theater, the Classic performs only works written before the start of the [[Last War]]. 
* [[Warden Towers]]. This district is the primary garrison of the [[Sharn Watch]] in Menthis. It's home to a community of [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] immigrants, and the [[Broken Anchor]] is a tavern catering to Lhazaar travelers.
