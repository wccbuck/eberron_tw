type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A few blocks from the [[House Tharashk Refinery]]
in [[Graystone]], Havulak Prospecting has catered to
explorers and prospectors for years. The shop stocks
clothing, guidebooks, and tools, and the crotchety
proprietor, a [[human]] named Havulak, has no end of
opinions about the best paths through the jungle.

Havulak Prospecting sells guidebooks outlining hazards in different regions of [[Xen'drik]], but they aren't cheap. Havulak himself writes bits and pieces of the books. Foiled too many times by the [[Traveler's Curse]], he gave up his dream of mapping the continent years ago, now focusing his attention on survival tips that are usually valid regardless of the landâ€™s strange shifts.

Havulak Prospecting competes with the [[Thrifty Traveler]] in [[Summerfield]], [[Southwatch]].
