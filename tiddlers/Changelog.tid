Use the [[Eberron TW Updater]] to update your local copy to the latest version.

!!! 1.16.4 <span style="font-weight:normal">(May xx, 2022)</span>

* Added lots of info about the clans of House [[Tharashk]] from KB's recent [[blog post|https://keith-baker.com/families-tharashk/]]
** New pages: [['Aarna]], [[Brokaa]], [[Istaaran]], [['Oorac]], [[Torruk]], [[Torshaa]], [[Vaalda]], [[Veldokaa]]
* Made a separate page for the [[Inner Sun]] cult (distinct from the [[Vale of the Inner Sun]] demiplane page)
* "Torrm" the Gatekeeper is too similar to [[Torrn]], so I renamed her "[[Tazlag]]".
* Made some [[language]] changes. Removed "Vvaraa'shul" and merged it with [[Orcish]]. Added [[Low Giant]], [[Syrk]], and [[Khunanese]] languages, as well as the [[extinct]] tag.

!!! 1.16.3 <span style="font-weight:normal">(May 9, 2022)</span>

* Added [[gem dragon]]s, and their five varieties: [[amethyst dragon]], [[emerald dragon]], [[quartz dragon]] (renamed "crystal dragon"), [[sapphire dragon]], and [[topaz dragon]].

!!! 1.16.2 <span style="font-weight:normal">(May 7, 2022)</span>

* Clarified some language in the [[Towering Wood]] page
* Added a little bit to [[lightning rail]] and [[Wynarn Institute of Art]]
* Added some more content I missed from KB's blog post [[Arcane History|https://keith-baker.com/dm-arcane-history/]]
** New pages: [[Raela Solaen]], [[Lyssia Lyrriman d'Sivis]], [[Duran]], [[Beren]], [[Heken Askarda]]
* Added [[deceased]] tag for people/entities no longer extant. This tag enables the user to filter by individuals who are still around, not just a part of history
* Removed d' from [[Mala Boromar Jorasco]] because she doesn't have a [[dragonmark]]

!!! 1.16.1 <span style="font-weight:normal">(May 4, 2022)</span>

* Fixed half-moon weirdness in [[lunar phases of Eberron]] in some browsers
* Fixed a missing link in [[Age of Monsters]]
* Clarified a few points in some [[Storyloom]] pages

!!! 1.16.0 <span style="font-weight:normal">(May 4, 2022)</span>

* TW tools and features:
** Added [[lunar phases of Eberron]].
** Added the "List of tiddlers not in master copy" section to the [[Eberron TW Updater]] in order to show pages that were renamed or intentionally deleted in the master copy. This should help users stay up-to-date.
** Added [[profession]] tag for certain [[talent]]s.
** Added macro for "Find talents tagged with [title]".
* [[Storyloom]] rules and mechanics:
** Changed rules for [[Actions and Attributes]]. Now, instead of having a score for each of your [[action]]s and [[attribute]]s, you just have a check box: proficient, or not. Your dice pool always starts with 1, and then you add 1 more die if you are proficient with the action and/or attribute you've chosen, up to a total of 3 (before we bring in bonuses for [[talent]]s, [[momentum]], etc).
** Added rules for [[Challenge Tiers]]. These include clarifications for setting [[impact]] and [[risk]].
** Added another [[talent]] that's vital for long-term character advancement in light of the change to actions and attributes: [[Action/Attribute Mastery]].
** Changed [[momentum]] rules. Each player now has their own pool of momentum, rather than having one shared pool. That rule never really made sense.
* Lore changes/additions based on recent KB writings on the [[Eldeen Reaches]]:
** Added a bunch of new content to the [[Towering Wood]] page.
** Added to [[Wild Heart]], [[centaur]], and [[awaken]] pages.
** New pages: [[guardian tree]], [[Gywahar]], [[gaa'avassh]], [[dire rat]], [[horrid ape]], [[horrid rat]], [[horrid beast]], [[Crossroads]], [[Oalian's Voice]], [[Bloodhounds]]
** Removed //Grove of Guardian Trees//
** Moved [[Oalian]]'s awakening date 1000 years earlier, since the [[guardian tree]]s were made as a living seal of [[Avassh]], which would have needed to have been made at the end of the [[daelkyr]] incursion during the [[Age of Monsters]]. Also changed Oalian's pronouns to they/them as per recent KB writings
** Switched the [[manifest zone]] of the [[Gloaming]] back to [[Mabar]] (reverting my previous change to the [[Rot]]), since throughout canon and "kanon" the region is said to contain [[undead]] and the [[Children of Winter]] are said to be working to contain the region's influence.
** Reduced [[Greenheart]]'s population (6500 -> 5500)
* Misc lore changes/additions:
** Added a bit to the [[Keeper]]
** Added population demographics to more nations as specified in the ECS, though I bumped up the [[Eldeen Reaches]]' [[elf]] population a little bit (3% -> 5%) and the [[Shadow Marches]]' [[half-orc]] population (7% -> 15%)
** Reduced [[Darguun]]'s population by half, and reduced [[Droaam]]'s and [[Talenta Plains]]' by a little bit
** Edited [[Silver Flame]] and [[Pure Flame]] pages to indicate the term "Purified" is used only by Pure Flame adherents to describe the faithful, not Silver Flame followers as a whole
** Added abbreviated timelines from ECS to [[Age of Giants]] and [[Age of Monsters]]
** Added small pages for [[Tyman Three-Cloaks]] and [[Vilina the Unseen]], two pre-[[Galifar]] [[warlock]]s of [[Thaliost]]
** Added [[balewolf]] creature
** Added a bit to [[speak with dead]]

!!! 1.15.3 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Apr 12, 2022)</span>

* Added [[Curse of the Titans]] and [[Belericax]] from Secrets of Xen'drik.
* Added the missing towns [[Gjitha]] and [[Per]] to [[Syrkarn]]. Renamed the [[changeling]] previously named Per to "[[Vurs]]".
* Added "the" article to each of the [[era]]s.
* Added "Copy title to clipboard" button next to the title of every tiddler.

!!! 1.15.2 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Apr 8, 2022)</span>

* Improved [[Silver Flame]] holiday list (now shows dates)
* Tweaked a few of the [[language]] pages:
** Renamed "Old Common" -> "[[Lhazaaran]]"
** Changed linguistic roots of [[Azhani]]
** More changes to come.
* Added a bit to [[Lurker in Shadow]] and [[aboleth]]
* Added some demographics to the four big [[Khorvaire]] nations. Didn't do the others mentioned in the ECS because I don't agree with some of them; like [[Darguun]] shouldn't have only 6% humans. (EDIT: I take it back, there are good reasons for this)
* Added [[kleynam]] ("small town"), [[Asta Vanalan]], [[Sorallandan]], [[Ghallanda Scouts]].

!!! 1.15.1 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Apr 1, 2022)</span>

* Fleshed out the [[Sovereign Host]] pages a bit
* Added an Octagram svg image and put it on the [[Sovereign Host]] page, as well as recolored versions on each Sovereign's page
* Added a cool [[Silver Flame]] svg as well, with gradients and stuff
* Added [[Arawai's Blessing]] holiday
* Added a brief summary of each faith for the religion pages that just started with a bulleted list of tenets
* Adjusted [[Adar]]an city populations closer to original numbers in Secrets of Sarlona (doubled rather than 5x)
* Added a bunch of Adaran towns (stubs) to the map and adjusted river positions based on Secrets of Sarlona map
* Added [[varit]]
* Added "alternatetitle" field to certain pages whose names I've changed for one reason or another. That way, searching "Basura Swamp" still gives you "Basira Swamp" as a title match (which I renamed because I can't say "trash swamp" with a straight face).
* You can now also search for, say, "Rage of War", and [[Rak Tulkhesh]] will show up as a title match.

!!! 1.15.0 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Mar 25, 2022)</span>

* Added lots of content about [[overlord]]s based on [[KB's blog post|https://keith-baker.com/dm-overlords-2022/]]. Only made a few small changes for the purposes of this document: 
** I renamed "Asshalara" [[Zetsash]] because I didn't particularly like that name, and also didn't want two new members of the Bleak Council with super similar names ([[Shalashar]] and Asshalara)
** Please don't make me add Lolth to Eberron ugh
* Added [[minotaur]] clans:
** [[Blood Horns]], [[Blade Breakers]], [[Red Hooves]], [[Dawn Harvest]]
* Added [[hwyri]], gnoll demon hunters (previously buried in Znir Pact page)
* Added an [[Orien trade road|Orien trade roads]] between [[Passage]] and [[Varna]]. It's unthinkable there wouldn't be a superhighway between those two cities
* Added [[Oath of the Crown]]
* Added a few things from Sharn City of Towers that I missed:
** [[Breland Municipal Guard]] (renamed from "Royal Guard", which implies king's bodyguards), [[Toras Cant]], [[pen of the living parchment]], [[Cazha Bloodwing]], [[Torarg Blackhorn]], [[Tyasha d'Phiarlan]]
** Also added a lot to [[Lyrandar Tower]] from the [[web enhancement pdf|https://web.archive.org/web/20130531122202/http://wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ebwe/20041118a]], despite the author thinking Cannith manages hotels, Darguun is a nation of orcs, and the Boromars are humans. I picked out the usable parts.
* Edited travel times and costs considerably for getting around [[Sharn]]. See [[Wards of Sharn]].
* Added some content to [[Ardhmen]] from Secrets of Sarlona [[web enhancement|https://web.archive.org/web/20130510212024/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20070409a]], as well as the [[rendesa]] creature
* Added some creatures from [[Fiend Folio|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/1751/Fiend-Folio-3e]]:
** [[haraknin]], [[kelpie]], [[yellow musk creeper]]
* Added [[shadow step]] spell
* Added [[aurashala]] [[quori]]
* Made some adjustments to [[genasi]] [[talent]]s to reflect some changes coming in Monsters of the Multiverse
* Added [[Nobility of the Five Nations]] page. While I was at it, doubled the number of noble representatives in the [[Breland Parliament]]. I however kept the canon material about [[Antus ir'Soldorak]] having a [[Karrnath]]i noble title, not a [[Brelish|Breland]] one. Also split the pages [[Lord Mayor of Sharn]] and [[Cathan ir'Demell]].

!!! 1.14.3 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Mar 8, 2022)</span>

* Made some small additions to the [[Silver Crusade]] page
* Added some stuff from the [[4e player's guide|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/150472/Eberron-Players-Guide-4e]] in the pages [[swiftblade]] and [[Ghorad'din]]
* Added and linked [[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]] as well as a cleric who might be found there, [[Sejra Whitebinder]] (from [[Faiths of Eberron|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/51636/Faiths-of-Eberron-35]])
* Also from Faiths of Eberron: [[liturgical council]]s, and two examples: [[Host of Khorvaire]], and the [[Devout of the Celestial Crown]]
* Added [[Moon Breaker]]

!!! 1.14.2 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Mar 4, 2022)</span>

* Made separate pages for several people/entities who were mentioned in location/organization pages, but didn't yet have pages of their own. This is going to be a slow, ongoing effort; the intention is to have most named characters searchable, even if their description is not much more than a stub.
* Fixed some missing links

!!! 1.14.1 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Mar 1, 2022)</span>

* Added to the [[flumph]] and [[dreamspace]] pages from KB's recent [[blog post|https://keith-baker.com/ifaq-flumphs/]]
** New pages: [[Uul'gaanu]], [[Dream Scion]], [[Dream of Strength]], [[Dream of Perception]]
* Added pages related to the "Delirium Stone" Mark of Heroes adventure for 3.5e:
** [[Delirium Stone]], Lord [[Aehion Hanius Hayttear]], [[Charisma]]
* Added a section to [[talent]] pages which act as prerequisites to other talents. Now you can more easily see what you have access to when you take these prerequisites.

!!! 1.14.0 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 27, 2022)</span>

* Added a more robust tag system for [[magic item]]s. Created subcategories for weapons, armor, magical implements, accessories, and tools. This includes tags such as "[[detection]]", "[[stealth]]", and "[[mobility]]" that offer a bit of description as to the item's primary purpose. Because weapons, armor, and vehicles already have an obvious usage, I haven't put many usage tags on these items; adding the "[[protection]]" tag on every single suit of armor, or "[[mobility]]" on every vehicle, would be redundant. Full list of new tags:
** For armor/accessories: [[body]], [[head]], [[arms]], [[legs]], [[shield]], [[jewelry]]
** For weapons: [[sword]], [[dagger]], [[axe]], [[mace]], [[hammer]], [[spear]], [[whip]], [[flail]], [[bow]], [[crossbow]], [[projectile]], [[punch weapon]], [[any weapon]]
** For [[magical implement]]s: [[staff]], [[wand]], [[orb]], [[crystal]], [[rod]], [[tome]], [[holy symbol]], [[musical instrument]]
** For item usage: [[communication]], [[convenience]], [[destruction]], [[detection]], [[entertainment]], [[hindrance]], [[invigoration]], [[mobility]], [[protection]], [[recovery]], [[stealth]], [[storage]], [[summoning]], [[weapon enhancement]]
* Created an "Object Type" field and second tag field in <$button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-tiddlylink"><$action-setfield $tiddler="$:/state/tab-1473298955" text="Find Items"/><$action-navigate $to="Find Things"/>Find Items</$button>
* Made it so that spell descriptions transcluded into item descriptions don't include the "higher tier" section
* Made some cool svg symbols for all the [[plane]]s and [[dragonmark]]s. I'll be adding a bundle of all the plane symbols I made to the DM's guild at some point.
* Added some items from miscellaneous 5e adventures:
** [[pipe of remembrance]], [[tankard of plenty]], [[charm of plant command]]
* Renamed the spell "shield" to "[[aegis]]" so that I could make [[shield]] a sub-category of [[armor]]
* Added an [[attunement]] page
* Separated [[aasimar]] and [[tiefling]] talents into separate talents for each variety
* Added some new characters from KB's recent [[blog post|https://keith-baker.com/ifaq-oargevs-suitors/]] about [[Oargev|Oargev ir'Wynarn]]'s suitors:
** [[Haydith ir'Wynarn]], [[Rose]], [[Talalara]], [[Ilina Corla d'Cannith]]
* Added a lot to the [[Devourer]] page from KB's recent [[blog post|https://keith-baker.com/d6-devourer]]. Also added the following pages:
** [[Stormsingers]], [[stoneshaper]], [[wolfchild]], [[Shargon's Bargain]]
* Renamed "Dark Pack" to "[[Great Pack]]" to match recent writings on KB's blog; this may match the upcoming FoE: Threshold content. Also renamed "Storm Front" to "[[Kraken's Brood]]".
* Fixed some population/tag inconsistencies on towns that had more than 5000 residents. Some towns got upgraded to cities, others had their populations reduced.
* Drop-down for adding tags now only shows tags for that tiddler's category, instead of all tags for the entire document. The drop-down now loads much faster as a result.

!!! 1.13.7 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 15, 2022)</span>

* Added a bit of content I forgot to finish adding from KB's [[Ghost Stories article|https://keith-baker.com/ghost-stories/]]. Added to several pages related to undead, but also created the following new ones:
** Prince [[Moren]], the [[Silent Knight]], [[dawn specter]], [[Azael Vadallia]], the [[Crimson Shadow]]

!!! 1.13.5 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 11, 2022)</span>

* Added the [[Rose Queen]], [[archfey]] ruler of [[Shae Loralyndar]]. In canon, the ruler is "Lord Eversun", but KB refers to the Rose Queen as the ruler in the book The Fading Dream. I used the Selephra article from Dungeon Magazine #185 for inspiration.
* Added a bit to [[Starilaskur]] based on [[Crossroads of Destiny|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/361655/Eberron--Crossroads-of-Destiny-Starilaskur]] (3rd party)
* Added a little detail to cities of [[Cyre]]/the [[Mournland]], inspired by [[Politics of Cyre|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/385313/Politics-of-Cyre]] (3rd party)

!!! 1.13.4 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 8, 2022)</span>

* Added [[Nowhere]], a town in [[Breland]] mentioned in Five Nations
* Increased the [[spell tier]] of [[flaming sphere]] from uncommon to rare
* Fixed some typos, removed a couple of "as an action"s

!!! 1.13.3 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 7, 2022)</span>

* Added a [[talent]] tab to [[My Stuff]]
* Added several [[Pathfinder 2E|https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp4?Pathfinder-Bestiary]] creatures (some of which have been changed significantly from their pathfinder versions):
** [[baomal]], [[bunyip]], [[cauthooj]], [[shemhazian]], [[dezullon]], [[drakauthix]], [[grothlut]], [[gogiteth]], [[gug]], [[nilith]], [[sea serpent]], [[shuln]], [[slurk]], [[wendigo]]
** Also renamed "darkling" to [[caligni]].

!!! 1.13.2 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 6, 2022)</span>

* Clarified language on [[aspect]] page
* Fixed some typos

!!! 1.13.1 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 3, 2022)</span>

* Added some missing content to [[Mistmarsh]] and [[Faded Forest]]
* Corrected description of [[Seawall Mountains]]
* Removed reference to [[Mabar]] in the [[Gloaming]]. Decided it's a [[manifest zone]] to the [[Rot]] instead
* Added "exclude tags" options to <$button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-tiddlylink"><$action-setfield $tiddler="$:/state/tab-1473298955" text="Find Talents"/><$action-navigate $to="Find Things"/>Find Talents</$button>
* Fixed a few minor things (missing links, etc).

!!! 1.13.0 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 2, 2022)</span>

Lots of small changes that added up to a big change. The TW Updater addition in the last update probably justified a new version number! Speaking of which, I added support for the [[Eberron TW Updater]] back to version 1.10.0.

* Added content about [[Fairhaven]] from Dungeon 170/173/175 and Five Nations. This includes the wards of Fairhaven, which have been added to the map. Had to piece together where the boundaries of the wards actually are, but, I think these are right based on canon sources. Also omitted or changed the things I thought were dumb ("Dark Daggers Gang"? Really?) 
** Wards: [[Wood Ward]], [[Sunset Ward]], [[Chalice Center]], [[Whiteroof Ward]], [[Knowledge Ward]], [[Sovereign Ward]], [[Laurelbough Ward]]
** Other locations: the [[Distant Exchange]], [[Jorasco Enclave (Fairhaven)]], [[Old Tira's Mercy]], [[Underquay]], [[Vorenn's Walk]], [[ir'Uvanto Family Antiquities]], the [[Third Tower]]

** Organizations/Misc: [[K.N.I.V.E.S.]], [[ir'Lantar family]]
* Added content about the [[Grim Lords]] as per the recent KB blog post. Significantly augmented/altered the [[Sylian Varonaen]] page, and added [[Haeldar Krakensbane]], [[Ship of Eldaraen]], and the [[Vyrael Sisters]].
* Added a couple of towns to the map:
** [[Jarran]], which is referenced in a [[Korranberg Chronicle]] article
** [[Kerkulin]], [[Rhenshia]], and [[Tanar]], which are on the Five Nations map of [[Aundair]] but no later ones
* Made the map in the sidebar resizeable (desktop only)
* Other misc map tweaks and fixes
* Added content from old (Paizo-era) Dragon magazine:
** [[Khesavuthir]], [[Ghostclaw]], Clan [[Alarak]], [[Uraash]], the [[Brood of Ruin]] (renamed from "Cold Wind" since the name was kind of lame and also was too similar to [[Razor Wind]]).
* Added some magic items from [[Tal'Dorei|https://shop.critrole.com/products/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn]]:
** [[boots of haste]], [[boots of the vigilant]], [[cataclysm bolt]], [[corecut dagger]], [[dagger of denial]], [[echo stone]], [[magician's judge]], [[mirror of infinite transpondence]], [[raven's slumber]], [[rod of mercurial form]], [[stormrider boots]], [[summer's dance]], [[flamefriend lantern]]

* Fleshed out several "stub" pages that were heavily referenced by other pages, but just didn't have a whole lot of information. 
* Added the five ranks of [[modron]]s
* Added heraldic emblems to each [[dragonmarked house]]
* Removed the "d'" prefix from [[Uskal Orien]]'s name since he doesn't have a [[dragonmark]]

!!! 1.12.9 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 25, 2022)</span>

* Added the [[Eberron TW Updater]]

!!! 1.12.8 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 24, 2022)</span>

* Added missing links on the [[kobold]] page
* Added [[Moonspeaker]] [[talent]]
* Fixed links to [[Find Things]] that change the tab. I didn't realize the state variable for the tabs changed on tiddlyhost deployment, so none of those links have ever worked outside of my own local instance. Whoops lol

!!! 1.12.6 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 15, 2022)</span>

* Added [[moonstone dragon]]
* Added more to [[Kaius ir'Wynarn I]] and [[III|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]]

!!! 1.12.5 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 13, 2022)</span>

* Added talent: "[[I Know A Guy]]"
* Added a resistance to psychic damage to [[Mindless Rage]] talent
* Added [[plant creature]] as an option for [[Enhanced Wild Shape]]
* Added a little bit to [[Moonspeakers]]; I intend on making a Moonspeaker talent soon

!!! 1.12.4 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 11, 2022)</span>

* Added a separate page for [[Jaela Daran]], as opposed to linking all her references to [[Keeper of the Flame]]
* Added a bit on the [[Second Son]]

!!! 1.12.3 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 10, 2022)</span>

* Fixed a few missed references to old spell tiers. 
* Added link to Changelog in site subtitle ("Storyloom Edition, v.x.x.x")
* For node.js users only: added "isVolatileTiddler" to wiki.js since the October update requires it to run. 

!!! 1.12.2 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 9, 2022)</span>

Renamed [[spell tier]]s and [[rarity]] names. Spells and magic items both now follow the same naming convention (though tier 1 spells are still called "cantrips"):

|!Tier |!Name |
| 1 |Common |
| 2 |Uncommon |
| 3 |Rare |
| 4 |Epic |
| 5 |Legendary |

I might have missed a few, so I'll correct them as I find them. Also, changed the naming scheme of a few node.js files so that it'll run on case-insensitive (non-Linux) systems. (This doesn't effect anyone except the people running their own tiddlywiki server using the github code.)

!!! 1.12.1 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 8, 2022)</span>

Added more content from the [[Player's Guide to Eberron|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/29550/Players-Guide-to-Eberron-35]].
