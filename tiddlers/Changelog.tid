!!! 1.25.01 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Nov 29, 2023)</span>

* Made each [[talent]]'s prerequisites (if any) a list field, and used that to better organize the lists on the talent page so that talents are listed under their prerequisites. Added "Prerequisite" column to <$button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-tiddlylink"><$action-setfield $tiddler="$:/state/tab-1473298955" text="Find Talents"/><$action-navigate $to="Find Things"/>Find Talents</$button>. Also improved the "Other Talents" section on talents which were prereqs to others.
* While I was at it, I made the [[dragonmark]] talents for elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings require those ancestries' talents ([[Elf (talent)]], [[Dwarf (talent)]], [[Gnome (talent)]], [[Halfling (talent)]]) as prereqs. As always, GMs can veto prereqs for specific cases, like if (for whatever reason) a player doesn't want their dwarf character to have the usual mechanical bonuses for dwarves but they do want the [[Mark of Warding|Mark of Warding (talent)]].
* Changed the Shimmerwood Gnome talent into [[Gnome (talent)]].
* Changed the [[Lorghalan Gnome]] talent so that it didn't overlap with its new prerequisite.
* Changed the [[Halfling (talent)]] bonus for [[lightfoot]]: Now it's +1 [[impact]] when hiding, instead of an extra [[advantage]].
* Changed the phrasing of [[Hobgoblin (talent)]]
* Added talent [[Assassin's Eye]]
* Added [[warforged scout]] and corresponding [[talent|Warforged Scout (talent)]]
* Slightly adjusted the description of the [[Khunanese]] language
* Added a line about "Old Rion" to the [[Aureon]] page
* Added [[pathadrik]]. This band of "drifting giants" was very briefly mentioned in Secrets of Sarlona, but they were fleshed out in [[Talvakri's Guide to Adar|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/434918/Talvakris-Guide-to-Adar]].
** Also added a handful of other details here and there from Talvakri's.

!!! 1.25.00 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Nov 19, 2023)</span>

''PSA:'' You should check out the new fan-made Eberron supplement [[The Giant Guide to Xen'drik|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/450098/The-Giant-Guide-to-Xendrik]] because a) it's over 500 pages of awesome content, and b) it includes the [[planar symbols|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/388514/Eberron-Symbols-of-the-Planes-Art-Pack]] I designed a while back! I think this is my first DMsGuild art credit, which is pretty cool. In a future update, I'll add some content from there, but I need to read through it first and do some pondering on what belongs in this document and what doesn't.

Now for the actual changelog. TW-related things:

* Added a category selector to the search bar. This should help you locate what you're after sooner. If search "dragon" and select "creature," I'll only see creatures that match the search term, not items/locations/spells etc.
* Also added "Did you mean [this page]?" to the search bar if you made a typo and got no matches for your search. This uses a [[custom filter|$:/eberron-tw/filters/firstlevenshtein.js]] that finds the page title with the shortest [[levenshtein distance|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance]] away from your search term; so if you search "Karnnath," the search results will recommend the Karrnath page.
** Tiddlywiki version 5.2.6 has a levenshtein filter operator, but I didn't use it because it was much slower for my purposes. (I tested it.) Also, you may be wondering: why haven't I upgraded the Eberron TW to the latest version (5.3.1)? Because attempting to do so completely breaks the two-column plugin and mangles the menu bar, neither of which I made, so it would be a pain to try to fix. Past upgrades have broken the import function and the save function, so who knows what else would break this time. For now, I'm sticking with 5.2.2.
* Fixed the "tag" macro, or at least the way I call it, e.g. on the pages for [[planar realm]] and [[settlement]]; I accidentally broke it in v1.24.01 a month ago and didn't notice until now.
* Removed "shapechanger" from the auto-generated list of creature types on Find Creatures. Like all tags, it's still available under "other tag." I also manually added celestial, fiend, and elemental to that list (previously all lumped under "immortal").
* Tooltips for creatures now show the most relevant creature type instead of "creature." So hovering over [[angel]] now shows "category: creature, celestial" instead of just "category: creature." For instances where a creature has multiple types, I mostly erred on the side of which type was more rare. So, [[fomorian]] should show "giant" rather than "fey," even though it has both types. If a creature page has no type tag (like [[immortal]]), the tooltip still shows "category: creature."
** Instead of relying on a complex and slow sequence of filter operations for this, I made a new filter called "[[maincreaturetype|$:/eberron-tw/filters/maincreaturetype.js]]." It doesn't take an operator, just returns a creature type or "--".
* Changed several references of arrows being "fired" from a bow to being "shot," "loosed," or "launched."

Spells/items/creatures:

* Added spells: [[antagonize]], [[warp sense]], [[gate seal]]
* Clarified that when you incapacitate or kill a [[polymorph]]ed creature, it transforms back, and excess harm overflows onto its new form.
* Added items: [[amulet of duplicity]], [[amulet of the inferno]], [[antimagic armor]], [[armor of fungal spores]], [[armor of the fallen]], [[armor of weightlessness]], [[baleful talon]], [[boomerang shield]], [[bow of conflagration]], [[crown of whirling comets]], [[dried leech ammunition]], [[fabulist gem]], [[feywrought armor]], [[forcebreaker weapon]], [[gloomwrought armor]], [[hammer of runic focus]], [[house of cards]], [[jester's mask]], [[mimir]], [[plate armor of knight's fellowship]], [[ring of collecting]], [[rogue's mantle]], [[sensory stone]], [[sundering sphere]], [[sword of retribution]], [[sword of the planes]], [[tidecaller trident]], [[weapon of agonizing paralysis]], [[winged ammunition]], [[wraps of unarmed prowess]]
* Added creatures:
** Hierarch [[modron]]s: [[decaton]], [[nonaton]], [[octon]], [[septon]], [[hexton]]. Also added a section about hierarch modrons to the [[modron]] page, and removed the [[creature tier]] from "modron" as its a category of constructs encompassing many tiers.
** Other Sigil creatures: [[sunfly]], [[eater of knowledge]]
* Added "oddlewin" as an alternate term for a [[nilbog]]

Misc Eberron lore:

* Added the "Crowns for the Crown" challenge to [[Aureon's Crown]]
* Added languages:
** [[Stonespeech]], [[Sivis sign language]], [[Aelada]], [[Kaasvola]]
** Also added the [[sign language]] tag and [[tin ear]] item.
* Added some [[rakshasa]] names from [[this page|https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ItemName=Rakshasa]]
* Added a translation of "fey" (taarna) to the [[Goblin]] dictionary for the [[language translator]]
* Aligned the lore of [[Koulton Brightwind]] and the [[Wind Whisperers]] closer to canon; I don't know why I changed his story in the first place, but now he fled his house with an [[elemental galleon]] twenty years ago and not an [[airship]] ten years ago, and he stole the airship later.
* Added a bit on [[warforged]] composition (and decomposition)

!!! 1.24.04 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Nov 04, 2023)</span>

* Made improvements to Gk0Wk's sidebar resizer; now it doesn't scroll with the sidebar, and reorients itself properly when switching between 1 column and 2 columns
* Removed newline at the beginning of hover tooltip text that used to show up in some browsers
* Added some content about [[dragon]]s:
** Regional effects from the 5e Monster Manual
** More detail on each of the [[Sovereign archetype]]s
** Example cultures of the [[Thousand]], as well as types of nondragons who dwell there
** Random table of [[humanoid]] cultures in the [[Vast]]
** New pages: [[Hazcoranar the Gravedigger]], [[Golan Thunder]], [[Mazalaryn]], [[Rime]], the [[Marhu'kor]], [[bolatash]]
* Added [[Joliana ir'Wynarn]], and added to [[Marala ir'Wynarn]]
* Added the [[Hanging Gardens]] from the novel [[Night of Long Shadows|https://www.amazon.com/Night-Long-Shadows-Inquisitives-Eberron/dp/0786942703]]
* Added the [[Masque]] holiday based on cut content from S:CoT
* Added some variation to [[bugbear]] and [[lizardfolk]] size in their descriptions
* Added a few minor details to [[basilisk]], [[gibbering mouther]], [[hill giant]], [[otyugh]], and the talent [[Beast Companion]]

!!! 1.24.03 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Oct 23, 2023)</span>

* Reduced the [[experience point]] cost of increasing an [[approach]] score by 1.
* Improved the behavior of the "scroll to header" macro; now it'll appropriately line-break instead of staying as one solid button
* Added the [[Iron Circle]], adapted from the antagonist group in the 4e adventure [[The Reavers of Harkenwold|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/121978/Dungeon-Masters-Kit-4e]]. Related pages:
** [[Nazin Redthorn]], [[Kaltis]], [[Sturmik]]
* Also added the fiend [[Bethageh]], a sort of fusion of ideas from older editions; mostly it's a reskinned Baalzebul. I wanted to make another "claw" of the speaker of Eldrantulku, and found inspiration in the Fiendish Codex and other old books.

!!! 1.24.02 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Oct 15, 2023)</span>

* Reverted the suggestion that you can sometimes advance [[progress clock]]s with [[boost]]s. I feel like that blurs the line too much between [[overcome]] and [[boost]], and you can still narrate anything (even physical damage) as a future advantage instead of as advancing towards the end of a scene. I got caught in the trap of treating progress clock segments as hit points.
* Made some miscellaneous improvements to the phrasing and organization of [[Storyloom]] docs.
* Added an alternate option for allocating [[approach]] points in [[Character Creation]].
* Added a bit to [[Arcanix]]

!!! 1.24.01 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Oct 12, 2023)</span>

* Added "trait" [[aspect]] to the [[character sheet template]].
* Nerfed the lowest-level [[Spell Enhancement]] talent: Now it only allows you to upgrade your [[common-tier|spell tier]] spells. Common + uncommon was a little too powerful. Also renamed the talents "Spell Enhancement ([tier])" instead of 1/2/3, and added a new one for uncommon tier.
* Improved the tag drop-down menu. Now, it first shows you all the pages tagged with that tag that match the current page's category. Below that list, it shows you pages from other categories. So if I am on the page for [[Pact of the Chain]] and I click the "warlock" tag, I will first see all [[talent]]s tagged "warlock," followed by people who are [[warlock]]s and anything else that might be tagged "warlock." But if I am looking at [[Breggan Blackcrown]] and I click the "warlock" tag, I will first see a list of //people// tagged "warlock," followed by a list of talents etc. It's particularly nice when, say, viewing a holiday page, like [[Baker's Night]], then clicking on the [[Silver Flame]] tag and immediately seeing other events associated with the Silver Flame, without a bunch of talents, people, and organizations mixed in.
* Improved the hover contrast color of links in the search bar.
* Changed [[arcane adhesion]] spell to differentiate it from [[stick]]. In fact, I don't think I knew I had this spell in the TW when I added stick, nor did I apparently add any details about how it worked.
** While I was at it, I also made some changes to [[stick]]: increased the strength, added a duration.
* Changed [[dimensional pocket]] from [[transmutation]] to [[conjuration]], and also added the conjuration tag to [[rope trick]].
* Added some recommended spells to [[Storm Sorcerer]] list.
* Added some missing content to [[Lost]]. Removed references to [[doppelganger]]s there; the meaning of doppelganger has changed since 4th edition.
* Added "[[ooze]]" tag to [[living spell]]. It's what they were categorized as in 3E and 4E. Also added the ooze tag to [[animated breath]], as they're very similar.
* Added some other [[ooze]] creatures: [[reekmurk]], [[bloodbloater]], [[ethereal ooze]]

!!! 1.24.00 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Oct 09, 2023)</span>

New subversion, since I made a "breaking" change: I moved some macros I made out of the "core" directory into "eberron-tw" (e.g. I renamed them from "/core/..." to "/eberron-tw/..."). I also moved things out of "plugins/wccbuck" since I haven't actually packaged these changes as a plugin, and probably won't unless someone asks me to.

Actual new stuff:

* Added some content I missed from Sharn: City of Towers about the [[Guardians of the Gate]]. New pages: [[Kestran Dal]], [[Tethyn Olar]], [[Six]]
* Also added a bit to [[Blackened Book]]
* Changed Councilor Sorik Sensos's name to [[Sorik Senso]]; apparently "Sensos" was a typo in Sharn: City of Towers. Sure enough, that spelling only shows up once in that book, but it got picked up again in Rising from the Last War. I'm gonna go with original intent with this one and make it Senso.
* Changed [[Josilian Kan Tarlian|Sivis Enclave (Clifftop)]]'s name to ''d'Sivis'', as per another Sharn: City of Towers errata I hadn't seen until now.
* Added the [[patron ancestor]] [[Ozaera]], based on [[this old sample Tairnadal character|https://bossythecow.com/RAEL.pdf]]; I've renamed him from "Daerath Ozeyra," since "Daerath" is reminiscent of the decidedly not-honest [[Daera Sorandal]], and the "ey" in "Ozeyra" seems at odds with other elvish names.
* Added some details to [[Stormwind Keep]] from the short story "Principles of Fire."
* New [[talent]]s for [[dragonborn]]: [[Dragon Hide]], [[Dragon Wings]]
* Added the spell [[gravity well]], loosely based on the "gravity sinkhole" dunamancy spell
* Added a few rare-tier [[weapon]]s (and one [[armor]]): [[flowing weapon]], [[adamantine weapon]], [[adamantine armor]], [[parryfoil weapon]], [[gravity bow]]
* Made a nicer "spell preview" macro for items that grant you access to a spell

!!! 1.23.04 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Oct 06, 2023)</span>

* Added [[Pukhalnum]], the language of the [[Ghaash'kala]], and added it to the [[language translator]]. I took much of the vocabulary from fan-made expansions of LotR's Black Speech ([[mostly from here|https://pdfcoffee.com/english-orcish-dictionary-2-pdf-free.html]], prioritizing the Horngoth and LOS variants, but avoiding words based on Quenya). For some reason I decided to add over a thousand words to the Pukhalnum dictionary, way more than any other in this TW. 
* Added a bit to [[Ghaash'kala]] page, but also renamed all the clans except Maruk because I kind of hated their original names (especially "Jaasakah". Sounds like "Jessica" in a valley girl accent). As with the Pukhalnum language, I took inspiration from various orcish dictionaries online, attempting to match the name's canon translation to a cooler-sounding orcish word. The new names are: Vadokah (Jaasakah), Dumul (Kastar), and Jundaut (Vanka).
** I also changed some Ghaash'kala names. I know there may be a tiny bit of Goblin in Pukhalnum, but "Torgaan Shashaarat" sounds like a stereotypical hobgoblin. I renamed him to [[Toru Durburz]].
** Side note: most of these names originated from Player's Guide to Eberron, which Keith Baker was not involved with.
* Slightly reduced the length cutoff for [[Dethek]] language translator. Essentially, translated words above the cutoff (1.5*(length of original word) + 4 characters) get shortened and retranslated. For Dethek, I changed 1.5 to 1.4. This didn't change any of the translated words in the example sentence, but it might change a word or two for you. If you'd like to revert this change for your local file, edit [[$:/DethekGibberishConsonants]] and delete the property "lengthpctcutoff" (click the trash can icon next to that field).
* Added tooltips (hover text) to the language selector on the translator
* Added [[Golan Dol]] from [[this old writeup|https://web.archive.org/web/20100525062430/http://www.bossythecow.com/Golan%20Dol.pdf]]
* Added [[flaming burst weapon]]
* Added a couple of new sections to the [[kalaraq]] page
* Added creature descriptions to some [[quori]] from Dragon Magazine #324
* Added sections on [[bard]] colleges to the bard page, and split up the [[Bardic Magic]] recommended spell list by college
* Lowered the [[spell tier]] of [[find the path]] from epic to rare
* Linkified "tabaxi" in a couple of pages that mentioned them
* Added some details about [[warforged]] freedom to the [[Treaty of Thronehold]] page
* Multiplied the number of ships of each of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] by 5(ish)

!!! 1.23.03 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Sep 28, 2023)</span>

* Added [[tabaxi]] and [[Tabaxi (talent)]].
* Changed the "Natural Weapons" benefit of [[Changeling Metamorphosis]] from [[advantage]] to +1 [[impact]].
* Linkified "[[weapon]]" in various pages that mention natural weapons.
* Strengthened and simplified the benefit of the [[Linguist]] talent.
* For the [[Elf talent|Elf (talent)]], improved the option for choosing a language (now you can choose two). The language option was always weaker than the cantrip option or +1 impact on a tool or instrument.
* On the [[gargoyle]] page, added a brief mention of a handful of animate gargoyles living in [[Sharn]] for centuries, as distinct from the ones roused by [[Sora Katra]] around twelve years ago
* Added a bit to the [[gaeth'ad]] page
* Added a section about names to the [[dragonborn]] page
* Added the possibility of advancing a [[progress clock]] with a [[boost]] action to the boost page (Note: reverted this change in v1.24.02)
* Added a note to the bottom of the [[impact]] and [[risk]] pages with some guidelines and examples of determining impact and risk with higher-tier [[magic item]]s and [[spell]]s. (Direct link: [[Note: Added Impact for Spells and Magic Items]])

!!! 1.23.02 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Sep 24, 2023)</span>

[[Storyloom]] stuff:

* Maximum [[momentum]] has been raised to 6.
* Simplified severe [[harm]]: similar to exhaustion with [[stress]], you suffer severe harm when you fill your right-most harm box. I slightly changed the text of [[life transference]] spell to reflect this change.
* Clarified on the [[talent]] page that if you take a talent that gives you an [[advantage]] to use a [[toolset]] or [[musical instrument]], you only get that advantage when you use that item for one of its intended purposes. That is, you don't just get a flat +1 d6 for all of your [[artificer]] spells when using [[tinker's tools]] as a [[magical implement]] if you take [[Guild Artisan]].
* Clarified on the [[boost]] page that you can't use the boost action when you have lost [[initiative]]
* Added a "once per scene" restriction on [[Bugbear (talent)]]'s long-limbs [[advantage]]
* Added a resistance to necrotic damage to the [[false life]] spell as it was strictly worse than [[aid]]. Also reduced the duration of the [[aid]] spell's temporary harm box to four hours.
* Added [[Tinkerer]] talent

Lore stuff:

* Added [[Arkhosia]] as the name of the short-lived [[dragonborn]] empire during the [[Age of Monsters]]; the ECS calls this empire "Q'barra," but I wanted to avoid confusion since the land of [[Q'barra]] is explicitly east of the [[Endworld Mountains]]. Plus, there were plenty of lore tidbits and names to "borrow" from the 4e Nentir Vale regarding a fallen dragonborn empire.
* Added a few details to the pages [[goblinoid]], [[koalinth]], [[Dhakaan]], and [[Droaamish History]], and [[Avassh]] based on some things Keith Baker said in a recent AMA
* Added some details about members of the [[Emerald Claw]]

Miscellaneous:

* Added a link to the [[privacy policy|https://www.privacypolicies.com/live/67833717-b40e-4b57-bc8e-bb123b87e321]] to the [[Readme]].
* Edited the download feature such that it removes the google analytics plugin from your saved copy.

!!! 1.23.01 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Sep 13, 2023)</span>

* Changed versioning scheme; now, the second subversion (e.g. the .01 in this version) is always two digits. Version 1.22.10 screwed up the sorting in the [[Eberron TW Updater]] and I couldn't figure out any other way to fix it.
* Added content from the Forgotten Relics adventure, including a couple of new paragraphs on the [[Terminus Station]] page, and a few new pages:
** [[writ of enforcement]], [[Cog Carnival]], [[Niho Koi]]
* Removed the "Story2" lists from the [[Eberron TW Updater]] so that your right-hand story river doesn't always get replaced with "Changelog" every time you update
* Made the zoom more granular on the Map (allowed half-steps with the zoom level)
* Fixed "sticky" table headers in [[Find Things]], spell list tables, etc. so they should show up properly as you scroll
* Clarified that [[Second Wind]] and [[potion of second wind]] can't clear your right-most [[stress]] box, the one that represents exhaustion.
* Fixed miscellaneous typos

!!! 1.23.00 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Sep 03, 2023)</span>

* Swapped Changelog and [[Readme]] columns back to how they were in 1.22.9. I failed to realize that the default page on mobile would then become the changelog rather than the readme. However, I made the Changelog now show "New here? Check the Readme" whenever the Readme is not in the story river, so that folks who navigate to this document via a specific page permalink, they'll see a thing that'll help them get their bearings.
* ''Significantly shrank the size of several cities'' on the map. In or around 1890, the population density of Chicago was 19 people per acre, Boston's was 20, London's was 58, Paris's was 125, and Manhattan's was 143 ([[source|https://sasn.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/inline-files/ManhattanDensityApril2014.pdf]]). By comparison, my [[Korth]]'s population density was about 2, even with population increased 5x above the canon numbers. Since I want cities in the Five Nations to resemble those of our world from 1850-1900, I needed to shrink 'em to match, aiming for 10-60 people per acre. (On average. Of course, certain neighborhoods are denser than others.) The specific cities I shrank, and the linear amount by which they've been shrunk, include:
** [[Korth]], by 65%. New population density is about 18.
** [[Flamekeep]], by 75%. New population density is about 50.
** [[Fairhaven]], by 75%. New population density is about 42.
** [[Thaliost]], by 65%. New population density is about 15.
** [[Rekkenmark]], by 50%. New population density is about 11.
** [[Wroat]], by 65%. New population density is around 20.
** [[Metrol]], by 55%. New population density (pre-[[Mourning]]) would have been around 18. Kept Vermishards the same size; I'd shrunk them already before about 9 months ago (v1.20.3) before I realized I should really shrink the whole city. So now the map of Metrol looks closer to the "official" map.
** [[Sharn]], by 60%. New population density is about 157, but when you account for the city's verticality, it feels closer to 20 on average. I recently discovered a strong piece of evidence for the diameter of Sharn. From Sharn: City of Towers: //"Skycoaches charge a standard rate of 1 sp per mile through the city. Thus, it is possible to get from Lower Tavick’s Landing to Upper Dura for about 6 sp."// ...So Sharn is canonically about 6, maybe 6.5 miles across. Roughly. That was my target for this size reduction, which I think matches well with my population density targets. I've also modified travel time as described on [[Wards of Sharn]].
** [[Graywall]], by 85%. New population density is around 36.
** [[Dar Jin]], by 70%. New population density is around 40.
** [[Stormreach]], by 75%. New population density is around 15.
** [[Io'lokar]] I didn't touch, since the pop density was around 10 already; that felt right.
* Added the [[Sprawl]] demiplane

!!! 1.22.10 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Aug 31, 2023)</span>

* Swapped column position of Changelog and [[Readme]] so that the Readme always shows up even when sharing permalinks for specific pages.
* Added some items adapted from Bigby Presents: [[armor of safeguarding]], [[bloodshed blade]], [[crown of the wrath bringer]], [[delver's claw]], [[glowrune pigment]], [[harp of gilded plenty]], [[helm of perfect potential]], [[lash of immolation]], [[longbow of the healing hearth]], [[mistral mantle]], [[qosqura piercer]] (adapted from "elven thrower," the altered "dwarven thrower" mentioned on page 64), [[ring of amity]], [[sanctum amulet]], [[shield of the blazing dreadnought]], [[staff of the rooted hills]], [[Stonebreaker's breastplate]], [[war horn of valor]], [[wayfarer's boots]], [[wyrmreaver gauntlets]], [[zephyr armor]]
* Some other items adapted from [[Visions of the Vault|https://web.archive.org/web/20170120214501/https://www.dmsguild.com/product/201140/Visions-of-the-Vault--Magic-Item-Compendium]] (a seemingly discontinued DMsGuild product): [[assassin's brand]], [[cuff of warding]], [[ring of trancesong]], [[siege crossbow]]
* Added [[gift of gab]] spell and [[forget-me-not hat]] which has a similar effect
* Also added the [[rune magic]] page which is used to tag items and other pages that utilize the power of giant runes
* Added the [[force sculpture]] spell, adapted from the item //Bigby's beneficent bracelet//. Speaking of spells, I also added [[sleet storm]] finally; it took me a very long time to realize it was different enough from [[ice storm]] to be worth adding as its own thing.
* Reduced the [[rarity]] of [[claws of the umber hulk]] to uncommon
* Added [[Great Stature]] and [[Elemental Adept]] talents
* Added a restriction to [[Implement Expertise]] to make it match [[Weapon Expertise]]
* Added a bit more detail to [[Syla Syrralan d'Sivis]] and the [[Ninth College]]
* Added a few [[gnoll]] names from Dragon 367
* Added [[Yllosavax]], [[Hathal Kosorak]], [[Haldren ir'Brassek]], [[Kelani Thauram]]
* Added the four branches of the court of [[Taer Syraen]]: [[Hail]], [[Ice]], [[Sleet]], and [[Snow]], from Dungeon 196. Made some changes, like the name of the Hail commander (too similar to [[Risia]]'s "Killing Cold"), and also made all the commanders [[eladrin]].
* Added details from Dragon 409 about "vectors" of the [[Draconic Prophecy]] to that page and the [[Chamber]] page
* Added details I missed from the 4E campaign guide to the [[Pyramid of the Ebon Flame]]
* Added a little to [[dragonmarked house]]
* Increased strength of uncommon-tier [[stick]] spell
* Minor [[Storyloom]] rule change: Made the final [[stress]] box represent exhaustion, taking several hours to recover from. Made a style change on the [[character sheet template]] to reflect that

!!! 1.22.09 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Aug 26, 2023)</span>

Added a lot of content from the [[Dragonmarked book|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/54305/Dragonmarked-35]].

* Miscellaneous: [[heirloom performance]], [[whispering wind]], [[Reslyn House]], [[Medani prophet]]
* Renamed "Vedykar Enclave" to [[Resthold]] as it's described in Dragonmarked.
* Added many other miscellaneous factoids and quotes from Dragonmarked to existing pages

!!! 1.22.08 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Aug 24, 2023)</span>

* Added some new creatures: [[achaierai]], [[phaerimm]], [[sword spider]]
* Added details to [[bebilith]] and increased its [[creature tier]] to 4
* Added lifespans and example names to each of the true [[giant]]s
* Added the talent [[Rune Shaper]]
* Added [[Corius Corralyn d'Sivis]]
* Added some sample names to the following pages: [[gnome]], [[half-elf]], [[Breland]], [[Aundair]], [[Karrnath]], [[Thrane]]
* Added links to [[talent]]s to related pages (e.g. the [[atavist]] page now has a link to [[Atavist (talent)]])

!!! 1.22.07 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Aug 18, 2023)</span>

* Added [[Harmattan]], [[Indigo]], and [[Hydra]] from [[The Shattered Land|https://www.amazon.com/Shattered-Land-Dreaming-Dark-Book/dp/0786938218]]
* Added the [[Duurwood]] forest in [[Droaam]], as described in the book [[The Queen of Stone|https://www.amazon.com/Queen-Stone-Thorn-Breland-ebook/dp/B00333FGIW/]]
* Added an Ossuary section to the [[Great Crag]]
* Added a lot to [[Sarmondelaryx]]
* Added past [[Keepers of the Flame|Keeper of the Flame]]
* Added past blood regents of [[Thrane]] to [[Diani ir'Wynarn]]'s page
* Added the [[immoth]] creature mentioned in the ECS as a creature of [[Risia]], but made it more aligned with Exploring Eberron's take on Risia and the Killing Cold
* Added the item [[volcanic ventilator]]
* Added some new sites on the map: [[Kruuth Tor]], [[Skerritburg]], [[Olinton]], [[Harrack]]
* Reduced the [[rarity]] of [[armor of resistance]] from rare to uncommon
* Added to [[schema]], and in the section of the [[magic item]] page describing the creation of magic items, made creating schemas much harder
* Made a note that the [[Dhakaani]] language remained unchanged during the Empire of [[Dhakaan]] due to the influence of the [[Uul Dhakaan]].
* Removed the baffling final paragraph from [[Luca Syara]], which is adapted from the sidebar about her from Sharn: City of Towers. The Lords of Dust are apparently hunting her down? Why? It's not written like an adventure hook or fill-in-the-blank mystery either. Just weird.
* Added a couple of missing translations for tribe names in the [[Ghaal'dar]] page
* Fixed the lists and filters on the [[arcane order]] page
* Linkified the [[Race of Eight Winds]] on a few of the representative creatures' pages. I also changed something: [[gargoyle]]s have only been in the race for seven years, not twelve. This change was made to match up with recent writings about gargoyles.
* Clarified where destroyed [[radiant idol]]s reform
* Added the disgusting process of [[dolgrim]] and [[dolgaunt]] reproduction from [[this blog post|https://keith-baker.com/qa-daelkyr-and-the-prophecy/]]
* Added to the [[adventurers' guild]] page, defined what an adventurer is
* Grammar fix: Put several floating periods and commas inside of their preceding quotation marks. I almost certainly did not get all of them.

!!! 1.22.06 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Aug 06, 2023)</span>

* Renamed Kashtarhak to [[Neabaz]] and incorporated some of that character's fly-like aspects into the speaker of [[Eldrantulku]]. Neabaz is just a cool character in Greyhawk/FR and I felt like he would be a cool addition to the Oathbreaker's retinue. I also got tired of the Kashtarhak/[[Katashka]] name similarity.
* Added [[potion of vitality]], [[potion of second wind]], and [[amulet of warning]]
* Added [[arjale]] and [[tantulhor]] metals, found only in the [[Ironlands]]
* Added [[Redleaf hound]] and [[Redleaf Harriers]]
* Added a note about the ritual to create [[holy water]]

!!! 1.22.05 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Aug 02, 2023)</span>

* Added a new [[Storyloom]] mechanic: [[initiative]]. Changed the [[Danger Sense]] talent to interact with that mechanic, and added the [[Parry and Riposte]] talent. Also changed a few items to interact with initiative, such as the [[thwackstaff]].
* Removed the "large" advantage from [[spellguard shield]]
* Added a [[dispel immortal]] option to [[bell branch]] (it was underpowered at that rarity)
* Removed the suggested "lost [[momentum]]" [[consequence]] when using a [[boost]] action type with the [[Dice Roller]]
* Added new armors that have some of the magic armor/shield special abilities from Pathfinder, altered to make sense in the [[Storyloom]] system:
** [[benevolent armor]], [[billowing armor]], [[balanced armor]], [[bitter armor]], [[champion armor]], [[champion shield]], [[death ward armor]], [[fortified armor]], [[enhanced fortified armor]], [[impervious armor]], [[stanching armor]], [[jousting armor]], [[slick armor]], [[expeditious armor]], [[rallying armor]], [[cotraveling cloak]], [[brawling armor]], [[hosteling armor]], [[sunlight armor]], [[wild shape armor]], [[armor of righteous might]], [[mistmail]], [[armor of barding]], [[boneless leather armor]], [[celestial armor]], [[gug hide armor]], [[hamatula hide armor]], [[coruscating raiment]], [[daystar half-plate]], [[clangorous shield]], [[mirrored shield]], [[wyrmsbreath shield]], [[ghost touch shield]], [[lion shield]], [[volcanic shield]]
* Added [[tar devil]] from 4e's Threats to the Nentir Vale (and the Reavers of Harkenwold adventure)
* Added [[myrnaxe]] from Exploring Eberron
* Added [[speak with dead]] to [[Grave Domain]] spell list
* Added a bit to [[Sentinel Marshals]] page
* Clarified that you can't benefit from the effects of most of your worn equipment in [[Wild Shape (talent)]]
* Clarified effect of [[death ward]] spell

!!! 1.22.04 <span style="font-weight:normal">(July 28, 2023)</span>

* Added some content from [[Linvraki's Guide to Syrkarn|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/429681/Linvakris-Guide-to-Syrkarn]] by Vani Srinivasan. I added some details to each of the provinces along with [[Gjitha]] and [[Nderitese]], moved Gjitha to the coast, and added some extra color to the [[Syrk]] language and the cuisine section of [[Syrks]] page. I didn't add everything, since not all of it resonates with me, especially the parts that contradict canon/kanon (e.g. the Flaming Sands section of Linvraki's says time moves faster in [[Fernia]], but that's not true according to Exploring Eberron). New pages:
** [[sheshmiraj]], [[Dal Vesh]], [[Flaming Sands]]
* Added some details to the [[Venomous Demesne]] page. Took inspiration from Megan Caldwell's [[Tiefling Treatise|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/368969/Tiefling-Treatise]], but changed details and used a couple of house names from [[Player's Handbook Races: Tieflings|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/124172/Players-Handbook-Races-Tieflings-4e]]. Made a new page for [[Bal Molesh]], even though it's a stub.
* Shrank the size of the [[Field of Ruins]] and [[Sul'asa]] on the map
* Added the missing detail that [[Mordakhesh]] wears a sliver of [[Rak Tulkhesh]]'s prison as a ring on his finger
* Added a bit to the [[weapon]] page
* Added [[monk]]-related [[talent]]s: [[Disciple of the Open Hand]], [[Tranquility]], [[Quivering Palm]]
* Added [[izmbi]] from Forge of War. Also added [[zezir]] and [[golothoma]] creatures from old Monster Manuals.

!!! 1.22.03 <span style="font-weight:normal">(July 7, 2023)</span>

* Added a lot to [[gargoyle]], [[Grimstone Keep]], and [[nabassu]]. New pages: [[Gargoyle (talent)]], [[Wings of Stone]], [[Hewn for Battle]]
* Added to/tweaked the talents [[Warforged (talent)]], [[Warforged Integrated Protection]], and [[Juggernaut Upgrade]]
* Added Atur content. New pages: [[Davian Karla]] and [[Lake of Sorrows]]; updated pages: [[Atur]], [[Duran]]
* The shapes of the districts within [[Cliffside]] of [[Sharn]] never really made sense. [[Sharn's Welcome]] is called the docks of Cliffside, but they are landlocked. [[Grayflood]] is the staging area to lift shipping crates up to [[Precarious]], but it doesn't border Precarious. So I changed things up such that they make sense. I also added [[Dwellwater]], an underwater district that existed in early drafts of Sharn: City of Towers (as "Stillwater," but I renamed it), and ended up getting cut. I put it just south of [[Ship's Towers]], but didn't decide on its exact shape or place it on the map.
* Specified that [[Jorlanna d'Cannith]] is an [[alchemist]]
* Added [[Talon Bay]]; it was given a name in the Eyes of the Lich Queen adventure

!!! 1.22.02 <span style="font-weight:normal">(June 26, 2023)</span>

* Updated the [[Eberron]] page to be a better summary of the setting
* Added [[Abyssal]] to the [[language translator]]

!!! 1.22.01 <span style="font-weight:normal">(June 20, 2023)</span>

* Added the [[Dagger Span]] bridge and slightly adjusted its position on the map
* Shrank the size of the [[Gloaming]] and the [[Twilight Demesne]] on the map
* Added some details to the [[War of the Mark]]. New pages: [[Earth's Fist]], [[Jack-in-Irons]]
* Added some details to the [[kobold]] page, and added the [[Khaar'paal]].
* Added over a hundred new personality/behavioral traits to the [[NPC appearance and personality generator]]
* Added over four hundred tooltips
* Reduced populations of [[Thronehold]] and [[Shavalant]] to match their descriptions
* Renamed Daggerchill River to [[Marrilach River]] to avoid confusion with Dagger River (just gave it a different Shattered Gates of Slaughtergarde name)
* Removed "creature template" tag since I was only using it for one creature

!!! 1.22.00 <span style="font-weight:normal">(June 15, 2023)</span>

Added a second story river! Now the Eberron TW has two columns, so users can look at two pages (or even the same page) side-by-side. I'm really looking forward to using this feature when prepping and running games as a GM. This enhancement is thanks to [[Saq's Stories plugin|https://giffmex.org/stroll/stroll.html#%24%3A%2Fplugins%2Fsq%2FStories]]. I had to tweak some things to make it work with my scroll-to-header feature and custom title bars, but I think it's all working! 

Here's how it works:

* Shift-click a link to open it in the opposite column. You can also click the "divert" button on the title bar (<$button class=<<tv-config-toolbar-class>>>{{$:/_sq/Stories/icons/divert-left.svg}}</$button> or <$button class=<<tv-config-toolbar-class>>>{{$:/_sq/Stories/icons/divert-right.svg}}</$button>) to push a page to the opposite column.
* Like you could before, you can reorder your open pages by dragging and dropping their titles in the "open" tab of the sidebar, but now, you can also drag a title from one column to the other in this way.
* Hide or show the right column by going to the "open" tab of the sidebar and clicking the <span class="sq-twostoriesonly"><$button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-btn-storytwotoggle">{{$:/_sq/Stories/icons/bars-empty.svg}}</$button></span> button.
* Resize the sidebar (and thus the two columns relative to the sidebar) by hovering your cursor on the left side of the sidebar; you should see a blue line, which you can drag to resize.

Another big change: ''I have compressed the Eberron timeline''. The length of the timeline of this world, just like the original 3.5E world map, was expanded to a huge degree to make the world feel more "epic." And as a result, just as with the world map, there are absurdly large stretches where nothing happens. The Empire of [[Dhakaan]] lasts 11,000 years? The same length as the entirety of human history in our world? That's really hard to justify!

So I've shortened all timeline dates older than 1300 years ago. I kept the last 1300 years as-is because shortening the lifespan of [[Galifar]] would cause lots of issues and confusion with various dates, and I wanted the current year to remain 998 YK in Khorvaire, and 1300 Unity in [[Riedra]]. The equation I used to adjust the dates can be found [[here|timeline shortening equation]].

With this change, the Empire of Dhakaan was founded 6300 years ago, and fell apart 3400 years ago. (A 3000-year-long empire is still massive.) The [[Age of Demons]] was only 16,000 years ago, not 100,000. More recent events are less shifted; for example, Lhazaar's expedition in canon was 3000 years ago, but in this document, it was only 2500 years ago.

This update also includes the following changes and additions:

* Tweaked the [[language translator]], added some missing words to the [[Dethek]] and [[Goblin]] dictionaries. I also added a whole bunch of Goblin words from a work-in-progress lexicon that [[Jerrod Taylor|https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?author=Jarrod%20Taylor]] is working on.
* Added some example [[warforged]] names from the 4E Eberron Player's Guide
* Added a little to [[Haruuc Shaarat'kor]]
* Removed "lightning is extra effective if used against metal armor" mechanics from certain spell effects and magic items
* Added the [[Consuming Storm]] overlord
* Added the event [[Madness of Yaruun]]
* Made the [[Hourglass Coven]] lesser [[archfey]] instead of some confusing nonsense about how they might someday become archfey
* Increased the ranges for age categories of [[dragon]]s; now "ancient" starts at 1000, not 800.
* Reduced the population of [[Daskaran]] to better fit its lore
* Added a little info on food and drink to the Five Nations Culture pages, and also added the following new pages:
** [[Blink Dog Brew]], [[Mror mushroom brew]], [[waterhouse]], [[preserving pine]]

!!! 1.21.04 <span style="font-weight:normal">(May 19, 2023)</span>

* Created a [[language translator]]! Transform anything you type into something that could plausibly be a translation into your chosen fantasy language. Ten languages to choose from, and possibly more on the way.
* Changed "Mjordai" language name to [[Dethek]]
* Changed the [[Zilargo]] town "Tzanthus" to "[[Szanthus]]." I wanted to highlight the "sz" phoneme in their language, since I added it to their language translator / gibberish generator.
* Added Quechua names to the [[Syrkarn]] part of the [[random name generator]].
* Added spells [[calculate]] and [[deadweight]]
* Added items [[ripplebark]] and [[gaeth'ad]]
* Added material spellcasting component to [[tiny hut]]
* Improved how tooltips look. I experimented with adding a filtered list of tags to the tooltip, but it slowed things down to a crawl.

!!! 1.21.03 <span style="font-weight:normal">(May 04, 2023)</span>

* Added a whole lot to [[Prince of Frost]], using content from Dragon 374. I changed some details, like the "Raven Queen" has been changed to the [[Lady in Shadow]]. New pages:
** [[Sisters of Lament]], [[Wintertouched]], [[Azara Iceborn]]
* Added the [[Castalaloa]]
* Added spells: [[hold unholy]], [[hold portal]], [[stick]], [[instant audience]]
* Increased range of uncommon-tier [[thaumaturgy]]
* Added another option to uncommon-tier [[gust]]
* Added a few towns from Five Nations I missed: [[Brek]], [[Brom]], [[Bull Hollow]], [[Eis]], [[Jern]], [[Karnel]], [[Lhaz]], [[Senne]], [[Trag]], [[Vom]]
* Added a section on the universal life force to [[Path of Light]], and better linkified/expanded the [[atavist]] page
* Changed [[unicorn]] creature type from [[celestial]] to [[fey]]
* Fixed a few typos I noticed when reading through the [[Eldeen Reaches]] page and several related pages
* Rephrased some things in the [[Readme]]

!!! 1.21.02 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Apr 25, 2023)</span>

* Added to [[skycoach]]. New related pages:
** [[sky medallion]], [[Serra Narim]], the [[Swan]], [[Andala Undalon]], the [[Gold Line]], [[Aureon's Flight]], [[Roo]], [[Eagle's Claw]], [[Dael Tantein]]
* Related: multiplied the number of coaches owned by [[Silverstreak Skycoach Rental Company]] by 5. (20 → 100)
* Fixed some typos in [[soarsled]] page
* Added a bit about "floating buttresses" to [[Sharn]]. I know KB likes the "flying buttress" joke, but that term means something specific and non-magical not only in our world, but also in canon Eberron (for example, see the description of the [[Cathedral of the Silver Flame]]). So I've renamed the magical one "floating" instead of "flying."
* Added appropriate cast times to [[antipathy/sympathy]], [[create homunculus]], [[scrying]], [[planar ally]], [[mirage arcane]], [[hallucinatory terrain]], [[guards and wards]], [[control weather]], [[clairvoyance]], [[prayer of healing]], [[wind walk]], [[tsunami]], [[tiny servant]], [[symbol]], [[regeneration]], [[phantom steed]], [[infernal calling]], [[illusory script]], [[foresight]], [[Medani foresight]], [[dream]], [[conjure minor elementals]], [[conjure fey]], [[conjure woodland beings]], [[conjure astral construct]].
* Replaced some "he or she"s with "they"s
* Added some more tooltips

!!! 1.21.01 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Apr 21, 2023)</span>

* Simplified [[boost]] mechanics. No more adding to your dice pool based on the [[approach]]es you choose. Instead, [[overcome]] attempts use two dice, and boosts use three. As normal, you can add dice to your pool before the roll using [[advantage]]s and after by [[pushing yourself|push yourself]] or spending [[story point]]s.
* Renamed "partial success" to [[mixed success]].
* Simplified the [[Spellcaster]] [[talent]]s; now they're only used for adding spells, not enhancing them to a higher tier. Enhancing spells can now be done by taking the talent [[Spell Enhancement]]. Doing so allows you to cast ALL your common/uncommon spells at one tier higher. Less bookkeeping this way.
* Also removed the confusing 2/4-segment progress clock on the [[spell tier]] page; made casting higher-tier spells more straightforward.
* Added talents: [[Special Stress: Bad Outcomes]], [[Warden of the Wood (talent)]]
* Added items: [[tanglefoot bag]], [[resilient document]], [[mask of the misplaced aura]], [[electric caltrops]], [[lucky stray ammunition]], [[Phiarlan hydra]]
* Added spell: [[beastspite]]
* Added creatures: [[ulgurstasta]], [[nilbog]], [[vargouille]]
* Added a new set of [[trinket]]s from [[Nerzugal's Game Master Toolkit|https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/202858/Nerzugals-Game-Master-Toolkit]]
* Added [[Hissing Chorus]]
* Added to [[Thelestes]], using content from [[this old write-up|https://web.archive.org/web/20160816161103/http://www.bossythecow.com/Thelestes%20v2.pdf]]
* Added more info to [[adept]] and [[Crucible (organization)]]
* Added more info to [[Azazar]]
* Added to [[Fortune's Fool]]
* On the [[banderhobb]] page, swapped the creature's connection with [[Mabar]] to the [[First Night]]
* Made [[daggerhawk]]s unable to support a human in flight, but they can support a smaller humanoid
* Renamed "Ja'khor" to "[[Va'khor]]." The name is supposed to translate to "Blackbloods," but "Ja" literally means "bright."
* Fixed a mistake in [[mask of the pact bearer]]; accidentally had a rare-tier spell in there. Swapped [[cloudkill]] for [[hellish rebuke]].
* Also fixed scroll-to-last-clicked-link behavior (known issue from 1.21.0).
* On pages that start with a description, added a divider between the "flavor text" and the main body of the text
* Character sheet css tweaks

!!! 1.21.00 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Mar 24, 2023)</span>

Big [[Storyloom]] change: actions and attributes have been replaced with [[approach]]es. Making attempts now works a bit differently; see [[Taking Action]] for updated details. The [[character sheet template]] has also been updated to reflect these changes.

Other Storyloom changes:

* Added a size limitation to [[Wild Shape (talent)]]
* Added +1 [[impact]] to [[Bushwhacker]] and [[Quick Formation]] [[talent]]s. Since the effect is limited to [[boost]]s, these talents were weaker than other "gain an advantage in this specific circumstance" talents.
* Changed bonus for [[Cutting Words]] talent: +2 [[impact]] instead of [[advantage]]
* Changed the effect of the [[thwackstaff]]: no more automatic counterattacks

Lore changes and additions:

* Added a lot to [[Castle Arakhain]]
** New pages: [[Beggar Dane (Swords of Liberty)]], [[ghost tiger]], [[Brela ir'Wynarn]], [[Cavril "Collar" Blackwood]], [[Mistress Green]]
* Added to [[ogre]], [[cyclops]], [[peryton]], [[demonglass]], and [[Frostmantle]]
* Removed [[kalashtar]] from the possible list of humanoids for the [[reincarnate]] spell
* Added tooltips to each of the [[moon]]s

Known issues:

* Sometimes when closing a tiddler, the page will scroll to a seemingly random point. It's supposed to scroll to the last link you clicked on, as long as you haven't closed another tiddler since clicking a link. However, something's not quite right with the feature, and it may be related to the scroll-to-header feature. I've got my eye on it. (fixed in v1.21.1)

!!! 1.20.05 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 17, 2023)</span>

* Added [[unbreakable weapon]]
* Added to [[Atur]]
** New pages: [[Great Hall of Feast and Fortune]], [[Ministry of the Dead]], [[Vaults of the Dead]], [[Nighthold]], [[Old Bones (tavern)]]
* Added to [[Kethelrax the Cunning]] and [[Shaarat Kol]]
* Added to [[Rhesh Turakbar]] and [[Turakbar's Fist]]. Changed "Haalrac" to "[[Hunrut]]," since searching for Haalrac turns up a bunch of results for [[Kech Ghaalrac]].
** New pages: [[Hunrut]], [[Byraka]], [[Ghwyyr]], [[Haakar]]
* Added the [[talent]]s [[Jack-Of-All-Trades]] and [[Dilettante Spellcaster]]
* Added clarifying language to some [[Storyloom]] game mechanics

!!! 1.20.04 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 5, 2023)</span>

* Added a "scroll to header" feature. This allows me to have little tables of contents for long pages with links to specific headers, making navigation a lot easier. I can also link to specific sections on pages. This feature works much smoother than Tiddlywiki's default anchor links feature. In addition to links within a page (like with tables of contents), I can also link to headers on other pages; e.g. I can link a specific section of the [[Xoriat]] page like this: <<navAndScrollToHeader "Xoriat" "Denizens">>
* Renamed "Gordion rope" to "[[Gordian rope]]" (typo)
* Made [[Chalice Lake]] properly connect to its rivers on the map
* Added [[truthteller]] and [[orb of time]] from ExE
* Added some common magic items inspired by the "minor property" table of the 5e DMG: [[beacon weapon]], [[delver's amulet]], [[gleaming weapon]]
* Added a little to [[Etrigani]]

!!! 1.20.03 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Dec 28, 2022)</span>

* Added a bit to the [[undead]] page
* Categorized [[item usage tag]]s into their own page, and made a separate tag selector on Find Items for these
* The page for [[Kellas ir'Moran]] referred to [[Valenar]] 13 years before it existed; I fixed that
* Added a bit to [[Vralkek]]
* Added some player considerations on the [[Dol Arrah]] page
* Added culture pages: 
** [[Culture of Aundair]]
** [[Culture of Breland]]
** [[Culture of Thrane]]
** [[Culture of Karrnath]]
* Removed "Five Nations in 500 YK" map since it wasn't accurate
* Added a bit more content to the pages of some [[Five Nations]] monarchs, mainly from the 4E campaign guide. Added a new page for [[Bortan ir'Wynarn]] (Boranel's son)
* Added a bit to [[Noldrunhold]]
* Significantly shrank the size of the [[Vermishards]] on the map. I made them a lot bigger previously to match the larger size of [[Metrol]] compared to the tiny city of the Five Nations map, but in so doing, I made them like 3 miles wide. They were more plateaus than towers. This way they match official descriptions better.

!!! 1.20.02 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Dec 19, 2022)</span>

* Added subcategories to [[My Stuff]] (under My Items)
* Changed the [[aid]] spell to be more akin to the 3.5E version (single target, morale boost). Also added [[potion of aid]].
* Changed [[rarity]] of [[potion of water breathing]] to common.
* Added [[ground thassil root]] and [[pit toxin]] poisons
* Added a few fey items: [[feywine raisin]], [[night's mantle]], [[pixie music box]]
* Added [[grig]] creature

!!! 1.20.01 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Dec 18, 2022)</span>

* Slightly reorganized the [[religion]] page. Also removed "Sovereign Host" tag from [[Children of Jes]] page and replaced it with "Dark Six"
* Expanded on [[Yarkuun Draal]] from the Five Nations book, with some help from Chronicles of Eberron to make it usable.
* Added content to [[Hektula]]
* Added the [[Jolnar]] family from Exploring Eberron
* More tooltips

!!! 1.20.00 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Dec 15, 2022)</span>

Lore stuff:

* Lots of [[Chronicles of Eberron|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/415474/Chronicles-of-Eberron]] content!
** [[crossbow]]s and related items
** Additions to [[aarakocra]], [[centaur]], [[genasi]], [[eneko]], [[grung]], [[kenku]]. Added new pages for [[dhampir]], [[firbolg]], and [[harengon]] (and [[talent]]s to match: [[Dhampir (talent)]], [[Firbolg (talent)]], [[Grung (talent)]], [[Harengon (talent)]], [[Eneko (talent)]])
** Lots of [[Tairnadal]] / [[Spirits of the Past]] content. New pages: [[patron ancestor]] (and five examples), [[warband]], [[zaeltairn]], [[zaelantar]], [[zaelta]], [[zaelshin]], [[Oath of Veneration]], [[Maezan Shal]], [[Shanutar]]. Deleted the "Vadallia and Cardaen" culture page and split its content across other pages
** Added stuff to [[Lorghalan]]. Renamed the city of Cornerstone to [[Hornstone]] because there is already a Cornerstone in Kythri and a Cornerstone district in Sharn. (Chose Hornstone because it's a synonym for "cornerstone" in Old English: "hyrnstan.") Also added new pages [[stonesinger]], [[Fleet of Lorghalan]], and [[Lorghalan Gnome]] (a new [[talent]]).
** Added a bit to [[Pylas Pyrial]], reduced its population, downplayed the rivalry between it and [[Shae Loralyndar]]
** Made separate [[Cazhaak Creed]] page, added some content to each of the [[Dark Six]], added new Dark Six spells, [[dark petitioner]] (with associated [[talent]]s), [[Reverse Speech]] talent, a new page for [[Thalanna]], [[Three Faces of Knowledge]], and other Dark Six related content
** Added a little to [[Ashtakala]], including random denizen/encounter generators
** Made additions to the following pages: [[necromancy]], [[vampire]], [[mummy]], [[Gath]], [[Odakyr Rites]], [[Mordain's Hall]], [[teleportation circle]]
** Added [[rootbound]] creature
** Added a new page for [[bastion city]] and linkified it everywhere
** Small tweaks and additions to Riedran [[province|Sarlonan province]] pages
* Added a bit to [[Windlost]]
* Added a new [[trinket]] list pulled from 5e Eberron books
* Renamed some [[Adar]]an places, inspired in part by Megan Caldwell's upcoming fan supplement for Adar:
** il-Shakti → [[il-Shati]] (I prefer this over her "Ohr Adeer" since in my Eberron "Ohr" is more of a [[Riedran]] thing)
** Hanuman → [[Havaluma]]
** Bishma → [[Biivma]]
** Shambala → [[Shavaala]] (I had this as "Sangala" but I like this better)
** Loohar → [[Looyan]] (I prefer this over "Loona")
** Khada → [[Kaadan]]
** Jathara Sound → [[Jahara Sound]]
** Not Adaran, but related: Akiak → [[Doriak]]
* While I was at it I renamed the leader of [[Deathsgate Guild]] to [[Kash Droranath]] instead of "Kassh"
* Added [[faerie frost]] (from Frostburn) and put it in [[Everice]]
* Changed lizardfolk references in [[Ring of Storms]] to [[dragonborn]]

[[Storyloom]] and TW stuff:

* Added some [[Storyloom]] mechanics clarification to the [[armor]] page
* Changed layout of [[character sheet template]]; made the stress and harm sections single rows, and made an option to add/subtract special and temporary [[stress]] and [[harm]]. Because they're now in a single row, I was able to clarify how [[magical healing]] works.
* Added [[damage type]] page and linkified it everywhere
* Linkified [[arcane magic]] in more places
* Made default number of segments for a new [[progress clock]] 4 instead of 2
* Fixed an error in [[Aasimar of the Silver Flame]] [[talent]]; once-per-day ability shouldn't deal fire damage
* Added some example spellcasting consequences to the [[consequence]] page

Added the following:
** [[Threshold]] (currently just a stub), [[Unicorn Point]], [[Shae Laen]], [[Nasaar Kol]], [[Sar'uul]], [[Westward Holt]], [[Highpeak]], [[Shavalsine River]] (made up that name), [[Eldeen River]], [[Copper River]], [[Arakhain River]], [[Korskiir River]], [[Korlaac Rift]], [[Border Road]]
* Updated [[Argonth]] page to match more [[recent writings|https://keith-baker.com/ic-exclusive-argonth/]]. This includes the following new pages:

* Also added [[Company of the Black Crown]], [[Breggan Blackcrown]], [[Westwind Riders]], [[King's Assessors]], and [[quickstone]]
* Updated population of [[Ardev]]
* Updated [[Orien trade roads]]

Maybe a controversial change: ''I changed some Sarlonan names and words'' for my Eberron. 

* ''Corvagura'' has been renamed [[Ghirvagura]]. I always thought Corvagura sounded too much like "Khorvaire" when spoken aloud, for place names with no common etymological root.
* ''Nulakesh'' has been renamed [[Nulakaz]]. "Nulakesh" just sounds so much like an [[overlord]] name (Sul Khatesh, Rak Tulkhesh). Also added [[Nulakazi]] language page; for my Eberron, this language takes phonological inspiration from Old Persian.
* ''Khalesh'' has been renamed [[Caleshaz]]. Too many "Kh" names, honestly. I always got it mixed up with [[Khunan]]. Also very similar to Sul Khatesh. This way it sounds a little bit more "Nahuatl"; in my Eberron, the words [[couatl]], [[tlexolotl]], and other Mesoamerican loan words originate from old Caleshaz.
* ''Shulassakar'' have been renamed [[shulatlaca]]. The -ar ending for a tribe of people seems like a [[Khorvaire]] thing, based on native peoples there like the "dar" ([[Dhakaani]]), as well as -ar names for Talenta families (Boromar, Halamar, Toralamar) and the [[Jhorash'tar]] orcs. The shulatlaca have roots in old [[Caleshaz]] so I made them sound more "Nahuatl." (I know that [[Qaltiar]], [[Sulatar]], and [[kalashtar]] are outliers to my Khorvaire -ar theory; I'm assuming those names are the [[Common]] terms for those folks, and they have their own names for themselves.)
* ''Korrandar'' has been renamed [[Telathal]]. Korrandar was always a terrible name; it doesn't sound Adaran or Quor or Draconic at all. Korranberg, Kol Korran, Korranath, "dar" (goblins); it sounds 100% Khorvairian. How did I get "Telathal"? I plugged "Korrandar" into a "Common to Quor" gibberish generator and that's what popped out.
* ''Helkashtai'' was renamed [[Helkatash]] since she is an [[Inspired]], not a [[kalashtar]] of the Kashtai line. 
* ''Sulatesh'' was renamed [[Shoralath]]. "Sulatesh" sounds like [[Sulat|Sulat League]] and is just one "k" away from [[Sul Khatesh]].
* Not Sarlonan, but Pasha ''Raqashtar'' has been renamed [[Raqazda]]. Too many "ashta"s.

New content and features:

* Made all tooltips include article and title. So now, hovering over a link that says [[City of Towers|Sharn]] but actually links to Sharn will show "Sharn:" followed by the page's tooltip. Pages that have a "tier" (magic items, creatures, and spells) also show that information in the tooltip.
** While I was at it, I added many, many more tooltips (1186 pages now have specific tooltips, up from 723)
* Added the talents [[Divine Sense]], [[Totemic Attunement: Bear]], and [[Totemic Attunement: Eagle]]
* Added [[divine smite]] spell
* Added creatures [[skitterwidget]], [[bodytaker plant]], [[podling]], [[brain in a jar]], [[necrichor]], [[zombie clot]], [[strigoi]], [[unspeakable horror]], [[gremishka]]
* Added items [[watchful helm]], [[silvered weapon]], [[monster hunter's pack]]
* Added [[Cairn Hill]] and the [[Battle of Cairn Hill]], as well as [[Nystrum Shadar]] and the fortresses [[Castle Rhonewatch]] and [[Arolangard]]

Tweaks, bug fixes, and smaller additions:

* Replaced some [[Orien trade roads]] with "mundane" roads as per official map
* Fixed display bug for [[Fairhold]] district on map
* Removed creature tier from [[clockwork]] since it's more of a creature type than a creature itself; plus, one of the clockwork creatures is a different tier anyway
* Added lineage stuff to the [[kalashtar]] page
* Added a blurb about urban shifters to the [[shifter]] page
* Added the five beast spirits to the [[Moonspeakers]] page
* Added "alternatetitle"s for several pages (various archfey, items with multiple names, etc) to make them more easily searchable
* Replaced Curse of Strahd [[trinket]] table with Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft trinket table, since the first 50 entries were identical anyway. Said another way: I added 50 new trinkets
* Fixed an error in [[Analects of War]]; they are only 2000 years old, not 3000
* Made [[Tain Gala]] quarterly instead of monthly. I could have sworn I already made this change but apparently not
* Fixed a very common typo throughout the document: "worshippers," "worshipping" etc have had one "p" removed

* "Linkified" some towns and fortresses in western Breland mentioned in some [[Sharn Inquisitive]] articles. I had been holding off doing that until FoE: Threshold came out, but might as well link them now and fill them in later. 

!!! 1.16.04 <span style="font-weight:normal">(May 22, 2022)</span>

* Added lots of info about the clans of House [[Tharashk]] from KB's recent [[blog post|https://keith-baker.com/families-tharashk/]]
** New pages: [['Aarna]], [[Brokaa]], [[Istaaran]], [['Oorac]], [[Torruk]], [[Torshaa]], [[Vaalda]], [[Veldokaa]]
* Made a separate page for the [[Inner Sun]] cult (distinct from the [[Vale of the Inner Sun]] demiplane page)
* "Torrm" the Gatekeeper is too similar to [[Torrn]], so I renamed her "[[Tazlag]]."
* Made some [[language]] changes. Removed "Vvaraa'shul" and merged it with [[Orcish]]. Added [[Low Giant]], [[Syrk]], and [[Khunanese]] languages, as well as the [[extinct]] tag.

!!! 1.16.03 <span style="font-weight:normal">(May 9, 2022)</span>

* Added [[gem dragon]]s, and their five varieties: [[amethyst dragon]], [[emerald dragon]], [[quartz dragon]] (renamed "crystal dragon"), [[sapphire dragon]], and [[topaz dragon]].

!!! 1.16.02 <span style="font-weight:normal">(May 7, 2022)</span>

* Clarified some language in the [[Towering Wood]] page
* Added a little bit to [[lightning rail]] and [[Wynarn Institute of Art]]
* Added some more content I missed from KB's blog post [[Arcane History|https://keith-baker.com/dm-arcane-history/]]
** New pages: [[Raela Solaen]], [[Lyssia Lyrriman d'Sivis]], [[Duran]], [[Beren]], [[Heken Askarda]]
* Added [[deceased]] tag for people/entities no longer extant. This tag enables the user to filter by individuals who are still around, not just a part of history
* Removed d' from [[Mala Boromar Jorasco]] because she doesn't have a [[dragonmark]]

!!! 1.16.01 <span style="font-weight:normal">(May 4, 2022)</span>

* Fixed half-moon weirdness in [[lunar phases of Eberron]] in some browsers
* Fixed a missing link in [[Age of Monsters]]
* Clarified a few points in some [[Storyloom]] pages

!!! 1.16.00 <span style="font-weight:normal">(May 4, 2022)</span>

* TW tools and features:
** Added [[lunar phases of Eberron]].
** Added the "List of tiddlers not in master copy" section to the [[Eberron TW Updater]] in order to show pages that were renamed or intentionally deleted in the master copy. This should help users stay up-to-date.
** Added profession tag for certain [[talent]]s. (EDIT 1.17.1: renamed to [[background]])
** Added macro for "Find talents tagged with [title]."
* [[Storyloom]] rules and mechanics:
** Changed rules for Actions and Attributes. Now, instead of having a score for each of your actions and attributes, you just have a check box: proficient, or not. Your dice pool always starts with 1, and then you add 1 more die if you are proficient with the action and/or attribute you've chosen, up to a total of 3 (before we bring in bonuses for [[talent]]s, [[momentum]], etc). (edit: actions/attributes were removed in 1.21.0)
** Added rules for [[Challenge Tiers]]. These include clarifications for setting [[impact]] and [[risk]].
** Added another [[talent]] that's vital for long-term character advancement in light of the change to actions and attributes: Action/Attribute Mastery. (edit: removed in 1.21.0)
** Changed [[momentum]] rules. Each player now has their own pool of momentum, rather than having one shared pool. That rule never really made sense.
* Lore changes/additions based on recent KB writings on the [[Eldeen Reaches]]:
** Added a bunch of new content to the [[Towering Wood]] page.
** Added to [[Wild Heart]], [[centaur]], and [[awaken]] pages.
** New pages: [[guardian tree]], [[Gywahar]], [[gaa'avassh]], [[dire rat]], [[horrid ape]], [[horrid rat]], [[horrid beast]], [[Crossroads]], [[Oalian's Voice]], [[Bloodhounds]]
** Removed //Grove of Guardian Trees//
** Moved [[Oalian]]'s awakening date 1000 years earlier, since the [[guardian tree]]s were made as a living seal of [[Avassh]], which would have needed to have been made at the end of the [[daelkyr]] incursion during the [[Age of Monsters]]. Also changed Oalian's pronouns to they/them as per recent KB writings
** Switched the [[manifest zone]] of the [[Gloaming]] back to [[Mabar]] (reverting my previous change to the [[Rot]]), since throughout canon and "kanon" the region is said to contain [[undead]] and the [[Children of Winter]] are said to be working to contain the region's influence.
** Reduced [[Greenheart]]'s population (6500 → 5500)
* Misc lore changes/additions:
** Added a bit to the [[Keeper]]
** Added population demographics to more nations as specified in the ECS, though I bumped up the [[Eldeen Reaches]]' [[elf]] population a little bit (3% → 5%) and the [[Shadow Marches]]' [[half-orc]] population (7% → 15%)
** Reduced [[Darguun]]'s population by half, and reduced [[Droaam]]'s and [[Talenta Plains]]' by a little bit
** Edited [[Silver Flame]] and [[Pure Flame]] pages to indicate the term "Purified" is used only by Pure Flame adherents to describe the faithful, not Silver Flame followers as a whole
** Added abbreviated timelines from ECS to [[Age of Giants]] and [[Age of Monsters]]
** Added small pages for [[Tyman Three-Cloaks]] and [[Vilina the Unseen]], two pre-[[Galifar]] [[warlock]]s of [[Thaliost]]
** Added [[balewolf]] creature
** Added a bit to [[speak with dead]]

!!! 1.15.03 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Apr 12, 2022)</span>

* Added [[Curse of the Titans]] and [[Belericax]] from Secrets of Xen'drik.
* Added the missing towns [[Gjitha]] and [[Per]] to [[Syrkarn]]. Renamed the [[changeling]] previously named Per to "[[Vurs]]."
* Added "the" article to each of the [[era]]s.
* Added "Copy title to clipboard" button next to the title of every tiddler.

!!! 1.15.02 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Apr 8, 2022)</span>

* Improved [[Silver Flame]] holiday list (now shows dates)
* Tweaked a few of the [[language]] pages:
** Renamed "Old Common" → "[[Lhazaaran]]"
** Changed linguistic roots of [[Azhani]]
** More changes to come.
* Added a bit to [[Lurker in Shadow]] and [[aboleth]]
* Added some demographics to the four big [[Khorvaire]] nations. Didn't do the others mentioned in the ECS because I don't agree with some of them; like [[Darguun]] shouldn't have only 6% humans. (EDIT: I take it back, there are good reasons for this)
* Added [[kleynam]] ("small town"), [[Asta Vanalan]], [[Sorallandan]], [[Ghallanda Scouts]].

!!! 1.15.01 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Apr 1, 2022)</span>

* Fleshed out the [[Sovereign Host]] pages a bit
* Added an Octagram svg image and put it on the [[Sovereign Host]] page, as well as recolored versions on each Sovereign's page
* Added a cool [[Silver Flame]] svg as well, with gradients and stuff
* Added [[Arawai's Blessing]] holiday
* Added a brief summary of each faith for the religion pages that just started with a bulleted list of tenets
* Adjusted [[Adar]]an city populations closer to original numbers in Secrets of Sarlona (doubled rather than 5x)
* Added a bunch of Adaran towns (stubs) to the map and adjusted river positions based on Secrets of Sarlona map
* Added [[varit]]
* Added "alternatetitle" field to certain pages whose names I've changed for one reason or another. That way, searching "Basura Swamp" still gives you "Basira Swamp" as a title match (which I renamed because I can't say "trash swamp" with a straight face).
* You can now also search for, say, "Rage of War," and [[Rak Tulkhesh]] will show up as a title match.

!!! 1.15.00 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Mar 25, 2022)</span>

* Added lots of content about [[overlord]]s based on [[KB's blog post|https://keith-baker.com/dm-overlords-2022/]]. Only made a few small changes for the purposes of this document: 
** I renamed "Asshalara" [[Zetsash]] because I didn't particularly like that name, and also didn't want two new members of the Bleak Council with super similar names ([[Shalashar]] and Asshalara)
** Please don't make me add Lolth to Eberron ugh
* Added [[minotaur]] clans:
** [[Blood Horns]], [[Blade Breakers]], [[Red Hooves]], [[Dawn Harvest]]
* Added [[hwyri]], gnoll demon hunters (previously buried in Znir Pact page)
* Added an [[Orien trade road|Orien trade roads]] between [[Passage]] and [[Varna]]. It's unthinkable there wouldn't be a superhighway between those two cities
* Added [[Oath of the Crown]]
* Added a few things from Sharn City of Towers that I missed:
** [[Breland Municipal Guard]] (renamed from "Royal Guard," which implies king's bodyguards), [[Toras Cant]], [[pen of the living parchment]], [[Cazha Bloodwing]], [[Torarg Blackhorn]], [[Tyasha d'Phiarlan]]
** Also added a lot to [[Lyrandar Tower]] from the [[web enhancement pdf|https://web.archive.org/web/20130531122202/http://wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ebwe/20041118a]], despite the author thinking Cannith manages hotels, Darguun is a nation of orcs, and the Boromars are humans. I picked out the usable parts.
* Edited travel times and costs considerably for getting around [[Sharn]]. See [[Wards of Sharn]].
* Added some content to [[Ardhmen]] from Secrets of Sarlona [[web enhancement|https://web.archive.org/web/20130510212024/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20070409a]], as well as the [[rendesa]] creature
* Added some creatures from [[Fiend Folio|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/1751/Fiend-Folio-3e]]:
** [[haraknin]], [[kelpie]], [[yellow musk creeper]]
* Added [[shadow step]] spell
* Added [[aurashala]] [[quori]]
* Made some adjustments to [[genasi]] [[talent]]s to reflect some changes coming in Monsters of the Multiverse
* Added [[Nobility of the Five Nations]] page. While I was at it, doubled the number of noble representatives in the [[Breland Parliament]]. I however kept the canon material about [[Antus ir'Soldorak]] having a [[Karrnath]]i noble title, not a [[Brelish|Breland]] one. Also split the pages [[Lord Mayor of Sharn]] and [[Cathan ir'Demell]].

!!! 1.14.03 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Mar 8, 2022)</span>

* Made some small additions to the [[Silver Crusade]] page
* Added some stuff from the [[4e player's guide|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/150472/Eberron-Players-Guide-4e]] in the pages [[swiftblade]] and [[Ghorad'din]]
* Added and linked [[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]] as well as a cleric who might be found there, [[Sejra Whitebinder]] (from [[Faiths of Eberron|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/51636/Faiths-of-Eberron-35]])
* Also from Faiths of Eberron: [[liturgical council]]s, and two examples: [[Host of Khorvaire]], and the [[Devout of the Celestial Crown]]
* Added [[Moon Breaker]]

!!! 1.14.02 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Mar 4, 2022)</span>

* Made separate pages for several people/entities who were mentioned in location/organization pages, but didn't yet have pages of their own. This is going to be a slow, ongoing effort; the intention is to have most named characters searchable, even if their description is not much more than a stub.
* Fixed some missing links

!!! 1.14.01 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Mar 1, 2022)</span>

* Added to the [[flumph]] and [[dreamspace]] pages from KB's recent [[blog post|https://keith-baker.com/ifaq-flumphs/]]
** New pages: [[Uul'gaanu]], [[Dream Scion]], [[Dream of Strength]], [[Dream of Perception]]
* Added pages related to the "Delirium Stone" Mark of Heroes adventure for 3.5e:
** [[Delirium Stone]], Lord [[Aehion Hanius Hayttear]], [[Charisma]]
* Added a section to [[talent]] pages which act as prerequisites to other talents. Now you can more easily see what you have access to when you take these prerequisites.

!!! 1.14.00 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 27, 2022)</span>

* Added a more robust tag system for [[magic item]]s. Created subcategories for weapons, armor, magical implements, accessories, and tools. This includes tags such as "[[detection]]," "[[stealth]]," and "[[mobility]]" that offer a bit of description as to the item's primary purpose. Because weapons, armor, and vehicles already have an obvious usage, I haven't put many usage tags on these items; adding the "[[protection]]" tag on every single suit of armor, or "[[mobility]]" on every vehicle, would be redundant. Full list of new tags:
** For armor/accessories: [[body]], [[head]], [[arms]], [[legs]], [[shield]], [[jewelry]]
** For weapons: [[sword]], [[dagger]], [[axe]], [[mace]], [[hammer]], [[spear]], [[whip]], [[flail]], [[bow]], [[crossbow]], [[projectile]], [[punch weapon]], [[any weapon]]
** For [[magical implement]]s: [[staff]], [[wand]], [[orb]], [[crystal]], [[rod]], [[tome]], [[holy symbol]], [[musical instrument]]
** For item usage: [[communication]], [[convenience]], [[destruction]], [[detection]], [[entertainment]], [[hindrance]], [[invigoration]], [[mobility]], [[protection]], [[recovery]], [[stealth]], [[storage]], [[summoning]], [[weapon enhancement]]
* Created an "Object Type" field and second tag field in <$button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-tiddlylink"><$action-setfield $tiddler="$:/state/tab-1473298955" text="Find Items"/><$action-navigate $to="Find Things"/>Find Items</$button>
* Made it so that spell descriptions transcluded into item descriptions don't include the "higher tier" section
* Made some cool svg symbols for all the [[plane]]s and [[dragonmark]]s. I'll be adding a bundle of all the plane symbols I made to the DM's guild at some point.
* Added some items from miscellaneous 5e adventures:
** [[pipe of remembrance]], [[tankard of plenty]], [[charm of plant command]]
* Renamed the spell "shield" to "[[aegis]]" so that I could make [[shield]] a sub-category of [[armor]]
* Added an [[attunement]] page
* Separated [[aasimar]] and [[tiefling]] talents into separate talents for each variety
* Added some new characters from KB's recent [[blog post|https://keith-baker.com/ifaq-oargevs-suitors/]] about [[Oargev|Oargev ir'Wynarn]]'s suitors:
** [[Haydith ir'Wynarn]], [[Rose]], [[Talalara]], [[Ilina Corla d'Cannith]]
* Added a lot to the [[Devourer]] page from KB's recent [[blog post|https://keith-baker.com/d6-devourer]]. Also added the following pages:
** [[Stormsingers]], [[stoneshaper]], [[wolfchild]], [[Shargon's Bargain]]
* Renamed "Dark Pack" to "[[Great Pack]]" to match recent writings on KB's blog; this may match the upcoming FoE: Threshold content. Also renamed "Storm Front" to "[[Kraken's Brood]]."
* Fixed some population/tag inconsistencies on towns that had more than 5000 residents. Some towns got upgraded to cities, others had their populations reduced.
* Drop-down for adding tags now only shows tags for that tiddler's category, instead of all tags for the entire document. The drop-down now loads much faster as a result.

!!! 1.13.07 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 15, 2022)</span>

* Added a bit of content I forgot to finish adding from KB's [[Ghost Stories article|https://keith-baker.com/ghost-stories/]]. Added to several pages related to undead, but also created the following new ones:
** Prince [[Moren]], the [[Silent Knight]], [[dawn specter]], [[Azael Vadallia]], the [[Crimson Shadow]]

!!! 1.13.06 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 12, 2022)</span>

* Added [[magical healing]] rules 
* Tweaked accents under [[Common]] language page

!!! 1.13.05 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 11, 2022)</span>

* Added the [[Rose Queen]], [[archfey]] ruler of [[Shae Loralyndar]]. In canon, the ruler is "Lord Eversun," but KB refers to the Rose Queen as the ruler in the book The Fading Dream. I used the Selephra article from Dungeon Magazine #185 for inspiration.
* Added a bit to [[Starilaskur]] based on [[Crossroads of Destiny|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/361655/Eberron--Crossroads-of-Destiny-Starilaskur]] (3rd party)
* Added a little detail to cities of [[Cyre]]/the [[Mournland]], inspired by [[Politics of Cyre|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/385313/Politics-of-Cyre]] (3rd party)

!!! 1.13.04 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 8, 2022)</span>

* Added [[Nowhere]], a town in [[Breland]] mentioned in Five Nations
* Increased the [[spell tier]] of [[flaming sphere]] from uncommon to rare
* Fixed some typos, removed a couple of "as an action"s

!!! 1.13.03 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 7, 2022)</span>

* Added a [[talent]] tab to [[My Stuff]]
* Added several [[Pathfinder 2E|https://paizo.com/products/btq01zp4?Pathfinder-Bestiary]] creatures (some of which have been changed significantly from their pathfinder versions):
** [[baomal]], [[bunyip]], [[cauthooj]], [[shemhazian]], [[dezullon]], [[drakauthix]], [[grothlut]], [[gogiteth]], [[gug]], [[nilith]], [[sea serpent]], [[shuln]], [[slurk]], [[wendigo]]
** Also renamed "darkling" to [[caligni]].

!!! 1.13.02 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 6, 2022)</span>

* Tweaked [[Taratai]] page to fit KB's version of early [[kalashtar]] history; added [[Kalashtar History]] and [[Void of Taratai]] pages.
* Clarified language on [[aspect]] page
* Fixed some typos

!!! 1.13.01 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 3, 2022)</span>

* Added some missing content to [[Mistmarsh]] and [[Faded Forest]]
* Corrected description of [[Seawall Mountains]]
* Removed reference to [[Mabar]] in the [[Gloaming]]. Decided it's a [[manifest zone]] to the [[Rot]] instead
* Added "exclude tags" options to <$button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-tiddlylink"><$action-setfield $tiddler="$:/state/tab-1473298955" text="Find Talents"/><$action-navigate $to="Find Things"/>Find Talents</$button>
* Fixed a few minor things (missing links, etc).

!!! 1.13.00 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Feb 2, 2022)</span>

Lots of small changes that added up to a big change. The TW Updater addition in the last update probably justified a new version number! Speaking of which, I added support for the [[Eberron TW Updater]] back to version 1.10.0.

* Added content about [[Fairhaven]] from Dungeon 170/173/175 and Five Nations. This includes the wards of Fairhaven, which have been added to the map. Had to piece together where the boundaries of the wards actually are, but, I think these are right based on canon sources. Also omitted or changed the things I thought were dumb ("Dark Daggers Gang"? Really?) 
** Wards: [[Wood Ward]], [[Sunset Ward]], [[Chalice Center]], [[Whiteroof Ward]], [[Knowledge Ward]], [[Sovereign Ward]], [[Laurelbough Ward]]
** Other locations: the [[Distant Exchange]], [[Jorasco Enclave (Fairhaven)]], [[Old Tira's Mercy]], [[Underquay]], [[Vorenn's Walk]], [[ir'Uvanto Family Antiquities]], the [[Third Tower]]
** People: Castellan [[Adele Fulirno]], [[Kreelo]], [[Thothar Ostren]], Countess [[Tesyn ir'Lantar]], [[Ilsya ir'Lantar]], [[Torven the Ageless]], [[Tirah the Shark]], [[Ralsor d'Lyrandar]], [[Fherina Arvindi]], [[Staunch]], [[Dharvek]], [[Imre Levalle]]
** Organizations/Misc: [[K.N.I.V.E.S.]], [[ir'Lantar family]]
* Added content about the [[Grim Lords]] as per the recent KB blog post. Significantly augmented/altered the [[Sylian Varonaen]] page, and added [[Haeldar Krakensbane]], [[Ship of Eldaraen]], and the [[Vyrael Sisters]].
* Added a couple of towns to the map:
** [[Jarran]], which is referenced in a [[Korranberg Chronicle]] article
** [[Kerkulin]], [[Rhenshia]], and [[Tanar]], which are on the Five Nations map of [[Aundair]] but no later ones
* Made the map in the sidebar resizeable (desktop only)
* Other misc map tweaks and fixes
* Added content from old (Paizo-era) Dragon magazine:
** [[Khesavuthir]], [[Ghostclaw]], Clan [[Alarak]], [[Uraash]], the [[Brood of Ruin]] (renamed from "Cold Wind" since the name was kind of lame and also was too similar to [[Razor Wind]]).
* Added some magic items from [[Tal'Dorei|https://shop.critrole.com/products/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn]]:
** [[boots of haste]], [[boots of the vigilant]], [[cataclysm bolt]], [[corecut dagger]], [[dagger of denial]], [[echo stone]], [[magician's judge]], [[mirror of infinite transpondence]], [[raven's slumber]], [[rod of mercurial form]], [[stormrider boots]], [[summer's dance]], [[flamefriend lantern]]

** [[Aldfirth's earring]], [[demonhoof hammer]], [[carton of useful pills]], [[feinting blade]], [[druid's sickle]], [[empathic rings]], [[irresistible tap shoes]], [[invisible dagger]], [[calming shawm]], [[ruinous flute]], [[infinite scroll]], [[extradimensional chestnut]], [[Mia's music box]], [[comb of grasping locks]], [[cautious candle]], [[automatic portraitor]], [[pocket cabinet]], [[shortchange]], [[bovine armor]], [[onona claret bottle]], [[tinker's hat]], [[truthseeker's parchment]], [[Ygritt's detonating sphere]]
* Fleshed out several "stub" pages that were heavily referenced by other pages, but just didn't have a whole lot of information. 
* Added the five ranks of [[modron]]s
* Added heraldic emblems to each [[dragonmarked house]]
* Removed the "d'" prefix from [[Uskal Orien]]'s name since he doesn't have a [[dragonmark]]

!!! 1.12.09 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 25, 2022)</span>

* Added the [[Eberron TW Updater]]

!!! 1.12.08 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 24, 2022)</span>

* Added [[character secret]]s
* Added a bit to [[doppelganger]] based on a recent KB blog post
* Separated the [[Draconic Eidolon]] from [[Dal Quor]] into its own page
* Added a little more to [[greatwyrm]] page, and added greatwyrm tag to [[Dolarashynach]] and [[Zenobaal]]
* Added [[Detention]] and [[Honors]]
* Added [[Carnival of Shadows]]
* Added [[Valshar'ak Seal]]
* Added [[Black Dogs]] and [[Moras Tann]]
* Added "and resistant to poison" to [[Divine Health]]

* Added missing links on the [[kobold]] page
* Added [[Moonspeaker]] [[talent]]
* Fixed links to [[Find Things]] that change the tab. I didn't realize the state variable for the tabs changed on tiddlyhost deployment, so none of those links have ever worked outside of my own local instance. Whoops lol

!!! 1.12.06 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 15, 2022)</span>

* Added [[moonstone dragon]]
* Added more to [[Kaius ir'Wynarn I]] and [[III|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]]

* Updated [[aspect]] page to say you start with 5 aspects, not 4
* Added talent: "[[I Know A Guy]]"
* Added a resistance to psychic damage to [[Mindless Rage]] talent
* Added [[plant creature]] as an option for [[Enhanced Wild Shape]]
* Added a little bit to [[Moonspeakers]]; I intend on making a Moonspeaker talent soon

!!! 1.12.04 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 11, 2022)</span>

* Added a separate page for [[Jaela Daran]], as opposed to linking all her references to [[Keeper of the Flame]]
* Added a bit on the [[Second Son]]

* Fixed a few missed references to old spell tiers. 
* Added link to Changelog in site subtitle ("Storyloom Edition, v.x.x.x")
* For node.js users only: added "isVolatileTiddler" to wiki.js since the October update requires it to run. 

!!! 1.12.02 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 9, 2022)</span>

Renamed [[spell tier]]s and [[rarity]] names. Spells and magic items both now follow the same naming convention (though tier 1 spells are still called "cantrips"):

|!Tier |!Name |
| 1 |Common |
| 2 |Uncommon |
| 3 |Rare |
| 4 |Epic |
| 5 |Legendary |

I might have missed a few, so I'll correct them as I find them. Also, changed the naming scheme of a few node.js files so that it'll run on case-insensitive (non-Linux) systems. (This doesn't effect anyone except the people running their own tiddlywiki server using the github code.)

!!! 1.12.01 <span style="font-weight:normal">(Jan 8, 2022)</span>
