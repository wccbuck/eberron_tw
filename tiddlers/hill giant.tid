Hill [[giant]]s are brutes that hunt, forage, and raid in constant search of food. They resemble huge, squat [[human]]s or [[half-orc]]s, and have a reputation for being selfish and dim-witted. Average height: 16 ft. 

A variety of hill giant known as a ''jungle giant'' inhabits the [[Jungles of Xen'drik]]. Pale green hair grows in short tufts over its barklike scalp and down its back and arms. They tend to be reclusive, and have a knack for [[primal magic]].
