Hill [[giant]]s are brutes that hunt, forage, and raid in constant search of food. They resemble huge, squat [[human]]s or [[half-orc]]s, and have a reputation for being selfish and dim-witted. They may not be as feebleminded as the average [[ogre]], but they do tend to be easily distracted by flashing lights or loud sounds. Their average height is around 16 feet, and their average lifespan is around 200 years.
