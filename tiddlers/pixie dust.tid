A small packet holds enough [[pixie]] dust for one use. You can sprinkle this dust on yourself or another creature you can see within 5 feet
of you. The recipient fly as fast as they can run, and can hover, for 1 minute. If the
creature is airborne when this effect ends, it falls safely to the ground, suffering no harm and
landing on its feet.
