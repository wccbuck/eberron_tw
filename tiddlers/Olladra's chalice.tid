title: Olladra's chalice
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This golden chalice is blessed by the [[Sovereign|Sovereign Host]] [[Olladra]]. On command, any liquid placed within it is purified, as by the spell [[purify food and drink]]. In addition, twice per day, it can be used to change 1 pint of normal water into [[holy water]]. These powers can only be invoked by a [[cleric]] or [[adept]] of the [[Sovereign Host]].
