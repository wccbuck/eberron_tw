        "text": "The [[Aurum]] maintains public offices in every capital of the [[Five Nations]], and in\nmost other large cities as well. These structures are usually plain and windowless, with only the Aurum’s sigil—a golden crown surrounded by a heavy chain—to mark the building’s purpose. To the public eye these are private clubs where Concordians enjoy membership’s benefits.\n\nRising from the side of [[Krona Peak]] in the [[Mror Holds]] is the Golden Vault, the Aurum’s headquarters and the site where the organization was first founded.\nUnlike the Aurum’s other strongholds, the Golden Vault is ostentatious—a sprawling structure spacious enough to accommodate hundreds of members and luxurious enough to satisfy their every need. Gardens filled with priceless statuary, a museum with treasures from nearly every age, and libraries containing the collected works of the greatest thinkers make it a veritable palace of culture and refinement. For these reasons, the Vault has countless traps, sentries, and magical wards—the best security money can buy.",
