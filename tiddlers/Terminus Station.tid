An [[enclave]] of House [[Orien]], this site contains the [[lightning rail]] station. The administrators coordinate the many [[Orien]] caravans that come and go from [[Sharn]]. Many of the other [[dragonmarked house]]s have small outposts in or around Terminus Station, allowing travelers to immediately access the services of House [[Sivis]], House [[Deneith]], and others.
