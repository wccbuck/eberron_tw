        "text": "A number of [[Cyrans|Cyre]] hold tangible forces responsible for the [[Mourning]], the most common scapegoat being one or more of the nations that opposed and ravaged Cyre during the [[Last War]]. A few of these patriots, such as the members of Prince [[Oargev ir'Wynarn]]'s Covenant of the Gray Mist in [[New Cyre]], channel their wrath into investigating the origins of the [[Mourning]]. The Covenant is withholding final judgment, and revenge, until that mystery is unraveled. In the meantime, these patriots work to cleanse the land of its twisted inhabitants. The [[bard]] [[Essyn Cadrel]] typically speaks for Prince Oargev at Covenant gatherings.\n\nOther Cyran \"avengers,\" such as the [[Mourning Dawn]], walk darker roads.",
