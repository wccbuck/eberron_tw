It's said to be an entrance to the abyss of\n[[Khyber]], and foul creatures live among the caves that\nhoneycomb its walls. A nearby village—also called Black\nPit—provides a haven for deserters and other criminals\nas well as a thriving black market.\n\nIf you have shady friends, you've likely heard of Black\nPit's reputation as a place to quietly \"disappear.\" Similarly, if you have ties to the [[King's Dark Lanterns]], you\nknow where to find some of [[Breland]]'s worst criminals.
