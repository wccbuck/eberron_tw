She wears a mask of black steel and an apron of\ndragonhide. Her form is highly mutable, and changes based on the object she is creating; when forging [[marut]]s, she takes the form of a [[giant]], and when crafting tiny trinkets, a [[gnome]]. It's possible\nthat she collects the memories of mortal artisans, and can\nreplicate their works at her forge.",
