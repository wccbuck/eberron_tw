        "text": "This citadel of brass-edged stone is the home of [[Io'lokar]]â€™s far-ranging [[wyvern]] riders. Spear squadrons spend their time performing aerial reconnaissance in territories that magical observation cannot reach. Members of the order also hunt monsters that threaten non[[dragon]] settlements, though they are forced to grudgingly ignore the [[rogue dragon]]s who too often do the same. Tensions between the dominion lords\nand [[Io'lokar]] run high at all times, and the [[Io'lokari]] tread\ncarefully in the [[Vast]].\n\nService in the Spear is a worthwhile option for combat-oriented characters seeking a place in [[Io'lokar]]. PCs who are skilled in riding flying mounts can ask to join a Spear hunting flight as auxiliary troops. Those taking a lead role in slaying a powerful threat will\nbe invited to join the order.\n\nPCs adventuring in [[Argonnessen]] might find themselves befriended (or even saved) by a flight of [[wyvern]] riders from the city. Such an encounter is one way to bring a PC party into [[Io'lokar]] for the first time.",
