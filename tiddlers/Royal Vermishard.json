Once, its halls were filled with illusory\nexhibitions and beautiful artwork, and floating gardens orbited the spire. Today, the gardens lie shattered amidst the wreckage of [[Crown Point]], and the halls have been cleared away to make room for weapons, loot, and soldiers. The self-styled Empress [[Donata]], a [[magebreeding]] experiment of House [[Vadalis]], \"rules\" over ruined Metrol from the abandoned Vermishard, clad in [[Cyran|Cyre]] Regalia and attended by her supersoldier underlings.",
