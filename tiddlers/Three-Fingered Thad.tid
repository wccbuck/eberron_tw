title: Three-Fingered Thad
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A dark-haired [[dwarf]] who deals in weapons and armor, Three-Fingered Thad is missing more fingers than he has left. Bets are sometimes made in the more disreputable taverns about when he will lop off another one. Some believe he loses them in accidents with powerful magic weapons that come his way, but the wounds are self-inflicted. The dwarf
maims himself as punishment for some dark sin in
his past.

Three-Fingered Thad can be found throughout the
city of [[Stormreach]] but most often in the [[Harbor]] district, where
his somewhat clumsy smithing skills and crude
but serviceable weapons and armor are appreciated
for their inexpensiveness. He sells reclaimed and
repaired arms and armor from a stall, as well as
doing a little tinker work. He also secretly also works for the [[Night Tide]].
