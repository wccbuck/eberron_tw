According to the [[orc]]s of the [[Gatekeepers]], the [[dragon]] [[Vvaraak]] gave them [[language]] as well as [[primal magic]]. This is likely an exaggeration, but the tribes do speak an ancient combination of [[Draconic]] and old [[Orcish]] which lends credence to the claims. It also has pieces of the language of the fallen kingdom of [[Corvagura]], brought by [[human]]s from [[Sarlona]] hundreds of years ago. Vvaraa'shul, as they call the language, is spoken throughout the [[Shadow Marches]] and in many pockets of the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. Most ritual books and histories of the [[Gatekeepers]] are written in this language. It can be found in non-magical engravings in ancient stone markers in the swamplands that warn travelers away from sites poisoned by the [[daelkyr]]. While most people in the streets of [[Zarash'ak]] speak [[Common]] or [[Azhani]], travelers in small villages of the countryside sometimes run into language barriers when they don't understand the ancient tribal tongue.
