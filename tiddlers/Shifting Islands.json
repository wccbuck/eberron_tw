Weather is generally more\ndynamic, and often at odds with the environment; a vast desert\ncan suddenly face a dramatic blizzard. Use the buttons below to generate random weather effects, monuments, or \"weird locales\" for ideas for what adventurers might find on one of these chaotic islands.\n\n<<<\n<$button class=\"vertical-margin-2\">\n<$action-chooserandom $dataTiddler=\"$:/RandomTemp\" $field=\"w1\"/>\n<$action-chooserandom $dataTiddler=\"$:/RandomPrecip\" $field=\"w2\"/>\n<$action-chooserandom $dataTiddler=\"$:/RandomWind\" $field=\"w3\"/>\nWeather\n</$button>\n\n{{!!w1}}, {{!!w2}}, {{!!w3}}\n<<<\n\n<<<\n<$button class=\"vertical-margin-2\">\n<$action-chooserandom $dataTiddler=\"$:/RandomMonument\" $field=\"monument\"/>\nMonument\n</$button>\n\n{{!!monument}}\n<<<\n\n<<<\n<$button class=\"vertical-margin-2\">\n<$action-chooserandom $dataTiddler=\"$:/RandomLocale\" $field=\"locale\"/>\nWeird Locale\n</$button>\n\n{{!!locale}}\n<<<\n\nKeep in mind that Kythri is home to [[mimic]]s of all\nsizes; an unusual monument might be a colossal mimic!\n\nThe primary denizens of the Shifting Islands are\n[[monstrosities|monstrosity]] and [[beast]]s that blend the features of multiple\ncreatures. Populations expand and contract, and don't have to\nbe sustainable, so adventurers could find a plateau filled with\n[[griffon]]s, or a realm of [[chimera]]s where each one has a different\narrangement of heads. The intelligent inhabitants of the island\nare almost entirely [[slaad]]i, but they aren't necessarily hostile. One might even stumble across a slaad village where adventurers are worshiped as gods!",
