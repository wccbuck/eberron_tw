!! Misshapen Giants Emerge From Mournland, Attack Keep

[[ARULDUSK|Aruldusk]]—Horribly twisted creatures more than twenty feet tall hurled boulders and wrecked under-construction fortifications at [[Angwar Keep]] on Zol, fleeing at dusk back into the [[Mournland]].

More than a dozen creatures were involved in the attack, which left more than twenty [[Thrane]] soldiers dead. They appeared to be [[giant]]s, yet their faces and limbs had what one survivor called a “melted” appearance.

Concerted efforts by the [[Thrane]] garrison and a group of [[warforged]] veterans known as the Redeemed repulsed the creatures after a pitched battle.

The [[Angwar Keep]] commander said the garrison has been doubled to guard against further attacks. Patrols north to [[Olath]] and south to [[Aruldusk]] will be larger and more frequent, he said.

“If there’s one thing my boys have, it’s practice guarding this stretch of coast,” he said. “Whether it’s [[Cyrans|Cyre]], [[Karrn|Karrnath]]s, or more horrors from the [[Mournland]], we’ll stop it and push it back into the water,” he said.

After the battle, the surviving giants swam back across the northern edge of [[Lake Arul]] and were last seen heading toward the ruins of the Cyran city of [[Eston]]. The Eston ruins are rumored to hold great wealth from the settlement’s heyday as a mining community, but few who cross the river into the [[Mournland]] ever return.

!! Countess ir’Hilyark Flees Wedding; Whereabouts Unknown

[[FAIRHAVEN|Fairhaven]]—The Hilyark family is searching for Countess Kehrlique ir’Hilyark, who disappeared from the family compound in [[Fairhaven]] on Zol, the eve of her wedding.

The bride’s father, Jarran ir’Hilyark, pleaded for information about his daughter’s whereabouts.

“I know everyone thinks this is a case of ‘cold feet,’ but my daughter has been looking forward to this day for years,” he said. “Tongues are wagging about this, but I ask you to remember that this girl has a mother worried sick about her. She has a six-year-old brother who wants to search every house in [[Fairhaven]], tears in his eyes.”

“Please, if you know where my daughter is, tell us. We only want to know that she’s safe,” he said.

Because Kehrlique attended [[Morgrave University]] in [[Sharn]] and has many friends in the city, she may have traveled to [[Breland]], Jarran ir’Hilyark said.

Vandrich d’Orien, ir’Hilyark’s fiancé, has promised House [[Orien]]’s assistance in making sure his bride is found safe.

House Orien agents are interviewing everyone involved with the wedding but keeping a low profile, guests said.

“It’s a bit awkward to have the groom’s family hunting for the bride,” one prominent wedding guest said on condition of anonymity. “On the one hand, of course they should help. On the other hand, maybe the bride doesn’t want to be found by the groom.”

The postponed wedding marks another blow to the fortunes of the Hilyark family. Last month, the Hilyarks lost a land dispute covering thousands of acres of prime vineyards between [[Passage]] and [[Bluevine]]. Kehrlique ir’Hilyark’s maternal uncle, Corso ir’Hilyark, was among the passengers on the //Blue Malia//, sunk this summer in [[Scions Sound]]. And a Hilyark-financed bridge over the [[Aundair River]] northeast of [[Fairhaven]], intended as a gift to the crown, has had work halted several times due to cost overruns.

Also missing from the Hilyark compound are Nendra Bachain, a Hilyark family servant, and Macham Turrisaud, Kerlique ir’Hilyark’s bodyguard.

!! General’s Family: The End is Near

[[STARILASKUR|Starilaskur]]—A fall from a horse has badly injured Hallorek the Black, last of [[Cyre]]’s [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]]-Generals. A younger cousin has told the [[Korranberg Chronicle]] on Far that family members are gathering at his bedside in [[New Cyre]] because “the end is near.”

Hallorek, 92, was known for personally augmenting the siege engines under his command with powerful magic during [[Cyre]]’s incursions into [[Karrnath]] in the 960s. He was stationed only a few miles beyond the devastation on the Day of [[Mourning]] and eloquently described the firestorms in the letter that resigned his commission. The letter was reprinted in handbill form and widely disseminated throughout [[Cyran|Cyre]] refugee camps.

After the war’s end, Hallorek was a common sight in those refugee camps, using magic to construct shelters and otherwise ease the plight of what he once called, “my countrymen, bound forever by memory and tears.”

Healers from the nearby temple to the [[Sovereign Host]] have been summoned to Hallorek’s bedside, but his advanced age outstrips most healing magic.

Chenni Nilsanza, a cousin of Hallorek’s, said that the general sleeps most of the day but is lucid when awake. She said that upon regaining consciousness after the fall, he expressed surprise to still be alive and noted the irony of dying in an equestrian accident.

During the [[Last War]], Hallorek eschewed an officer’s steed, instead electing to use his magic to fly from place to place. An expert in both the offensive and defensive aspects of siege warfare, he once said that cavalry was “no damn good in a siege, unless it lasts long enough that you have to eat the horses.”
