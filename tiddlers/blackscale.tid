Blackscale [[lizardfolk]] are hulking brutes that have been physically transformed by the power of [[Masvirik]], the Cold Sun. They inhabit [[Haka'torvhak]] and the surrounding jungles in [[Q'barra]], believing themselves to be the chosen champions of [[Rhashaak]]. Each blackscale has a sliver of a [[dusk shard]] embedded in their bodies, which is the source of their corruption; see [[Poison Dusk]] for more information about dusk shard creatures.
