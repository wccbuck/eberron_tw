(Rhamphorhynchus)

Dartwings, typically just called "darts," are small flying [[dinosaur]]s of the [[Talenta Plains]] with protruding needle-like teeth and long tails. They are the primary [[animal messenger]]s of the Talentans, and are often used by scoutsâ€”both full [[spirit rider]]s who may spend hours watching the world from above, and [[gleaner]] hunters who may just use [[speak with animals]] or [[beast sense]] to get information from their companions.
