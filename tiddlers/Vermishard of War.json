The Armory of [[Galifar]] once held the most\nimpressive engines of war possessed by the\n[[Five Nations]]. The spire below the palace was a\nfortress, and the Vermishard was surrounded by\ngarrisons and drill yards. \n\nToday, it lies in ruin, and has been heavily looted by Empress [[Donata]]'s soldiers.",
