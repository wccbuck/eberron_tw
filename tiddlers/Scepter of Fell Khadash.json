        "text": "This iron rod draped in chains was once wielded by a lieutenant of the [[overlord]]s during the [[Age of Demons]]. A dark red flame is always lit an one end, but it gives off no heat. The scepter grants the wielder a fiendish charisma, granting them a large [[advantage]] on relevant social actions. The wielder can cast [[cause fear]] for free at will, and can also cast the [[enervation]], [[dominate]], and [[power word pain]] spells.\n\nThe wielder of this scepter slowly becomes increasingly egotistical.\n\nThe scepter is believed to lie in a vault somewhere in the jungle ruins of [[Xen'drik]], though recent rumors suggest that both the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]] and agents of the [[oni]] [[warlord]] [[Tzaryan Rrac]] have learned of the scepter's location and are actively seeking it.",
