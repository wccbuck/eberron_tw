The Cloudreaver Principality is in some ways the antithesis of the [[Seadragons]]. If High Prince [[Ryger|Ryger ir'Wynarn]]â€™s rule represents stability for the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] as the nation moves forward to a new future, the Cloudreavers represent the violent instability of a return to the old ways of bloodthirsty piracy.\n\nCurrently the Cloudreavers have a fleet of thirty vessels, but these ships are remarkably swift; the Cloudreavers possess a number of //windsail//s, which are [[magic item]]s that can shift the wind in their favor. These treasures allow the Cloudreavers to range far from their homeland and to match the speed of [[elemental galleon]]s. Typically, the Cloudreavers prey on the southeastern shores of [[Khorvaire]], striking at [[Q'barra]]n, [[Aereni|Aerenal]], [[Darguul|Darguun]], and [[Zil|Zilargo]] vessels and villages; occasionally Cloudreaver captains even head into [[Brelish|Breland]] shipping lanes, attacking ships en route to [[Stormreach]] or [[Trolanport]]. The Cloudreavers prefer to strike at night, taking full advantage of the [[darkvision]] possessed by most of their sailors.\n\nMany Cloudreavers worship the [[Devourer]], and some develop [[divine magic]] abilities as a result of this devotion. The principality takes its name from this practice; tales speak of Cloudreaver pirates calling lightning from the sky to shatter enemy sails and ships.",
