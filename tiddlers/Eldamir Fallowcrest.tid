Eldamir Fallowcrest is a strange old [[elf]] who has taken up residence in the ground floor and cellars of the mysterious [[Lighthouse]] of the [[Harbor]] district of [[Stormreach]]. He maintains these chambers as his private haven and library. He is paranoid in his defense of his books, and though he allows visitors to examine them one at a time, he hovers over their shoulder. At the first sign of trouble, he locks down the library and activates traps to secure his collection.
