Riedra is offering economic assistance, but Talalara is offering something more—promising to train a new generation of [[Cyran|Cyre]] psychics, helping Oargev’s people unlock power they could potentially use to reclaim [[Valenar]] or [[Darguun]] or to create a new nation for his people. And if this proliferation of young psychics also served as an excellent cover for having more [[quori]] hosts on [[Khorvaire]]... so much the better.",
