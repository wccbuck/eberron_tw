After you drink this wispy potion, illusory images accompany your speech. You do not directly control the illusion, but the images are of creatures, objects, and places you describe, and act as you describe them to. The images never move more than 5 feet away from you, and are purely visual. The effect lasts for as long as you concentrate on it, up to 10 minutes.
