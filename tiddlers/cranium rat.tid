Cranium rats are created by bombarding normal rats or [[dire rat]]s with [[psionic|psionics]] energy. They resemble ordinary rats except for their slightly phosphorescent exposed brains. Cranium rats are no smarter than ordinary rats and behave as such. However, if enough cranium rats come together to form a swarm, they merge their minds into a single intelligence with the accumulated memories of all the swarm's constituents. The rats become smarter as a result, and they retain their heightened intelligence for as long as the swarm persists. The swarm also awakens latent [[psionic|psionics]] abilities implanted within each cranium rat by its creators.  A swarm of cranium rats communicating telepathically "speaks" as one creature, often referring to itself using the collective pronouns "we" and "us."

A rat separated from the swarm becomes an ordinary cranium rat, slowly declining to animal intelligence over the course of a few days. A single, low-intelligence cranium rat might use its natural telepathy to communicate hunger, fear, and other base emotions.

[[Mind flayer|mind flayer]] colonies sometimes use cranium rats as spies. The rats invade surface communities and act as eyes and ears for the [[elder brain]], transmitting their thoughts when they swarm and are within range of the elder brain's telepathy.
