You have formed a pact with a powerful [[immortal]] who has granted you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. With this book of ancient secrets in hand, you may cast any [[common-tier|spell tier]] spell you know with [[advantage]] and without expending [[stress]], as long as you spend over an hour preparing and performing the ritual.
