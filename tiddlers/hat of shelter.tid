This wide-brimmed hat of cream-colored wool grows into a three-person tent when the command word is spoken.

Speaking the command word again causes the tent to
transform back into a hat, provided that no creatures are
inside. Any objects inside the tent when it collapses are
ejected and remain outside the tent as it folds.
