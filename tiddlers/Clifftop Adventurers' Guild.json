Shekkal died in the [[Last War]], but the guild\nremainsâ€”a social club for adventurers and a one-stop\nmarketplace for anyone seeking capable champions. \n\nLocated in the\n[[Clifftop]] district of [[Upper Dura]], this organization has a\nsterling reputation as a source of reliable explorers and\nchampions. Clifftop adventurers are known for their\ncourage and integrity, and guildmaster [[Sumara \"Summer\" Korranor|Summer Korranor]] holds members to a high standard of virtuous behavior. As a Clifftop adventurer, you're expected to keep your word, to stand by your comrades, to uphold the law,\nand never to intentionally endanger innocents with your\nactions. Many of the local businesses cater to adventurers, and if you're a member of the guild, you can expect\na warm welcome in the taverns of Clifftop. \n\nThe Clifftop Adventurers' Guild headquarters is the physical and social center of its district,\na massive stone edifice built with the riches acquired\nover a lifetime of adventuring. Part quiet library, part\ncomfortable inn, part active gymnasium, and part rowdy\ntavern, the guildhall contains practically every facility\nadventurers could need to train, study, and socialize.\nThe neighborhood around it caters to adventurers' other\nneeds with its variety of shops and services.
