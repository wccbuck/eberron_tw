Dancing Shadows provides food, lodging, and basic
services to the many people who arrive in [[Sharn]]
every day. None of the inns or taverns are especially
remarkable; in this case quality is more significant
than quantity. Adventurers tend to stay in [[Deathsgate]], while the wealthy often go to [[Silvergate]] in
[[Upper Tavick's Landing]]. Dancing Shadows caters to
the commoners and traveling merchants who simply
need a place to stay at a reasonable price. 

This district also houses a small House [[Thuranni]] outpost.
