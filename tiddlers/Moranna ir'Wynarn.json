        "text": "Lady Moranna ir'Wynarn ruled the nation of [[Karrnath]] as regent after the unexpected death of King Jaron in 972 YK, up until the twentieth birthday of her nephew [[Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] in 991 YK, when he came of age and assumed the throne. During the [[Last War]], Lady Moranna gave the order to reinstate the [[Sovereign Host]] as the state religion of the nation in place of the [[Blood of Vol]], and to disband the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]], the [[Onyx Skull]], and all other chivalric orders of Seekers.\n\nLady Moranna continues to serve as regent of [[Karrnath]] since the ascendancy of [[Kaius ir'Wynarn III]], a post that has been transformed from a stewardship to a chief advisory position. She never ventures far from the court or\nfrom Kaiusâ€™s side, except when he sends her out in his name to\nhandle crises near and far. Moranna, a large, strong woman,\nhas a commanding manner and a no-nonsense approach\nthat leaves most of her underlings shaking in her wake.\n\nIt is widely known that Moranna possesses considerable skill with [[necromancy]]. In addition, she has a deathlike pallor that many assume to be a cosmetic illusion. Few know the truth: she's actually a [[vampire]].",
