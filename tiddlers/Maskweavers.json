The Talentans believe that the environs around them are filled with the spirits of their\nancestors, spirits of nature, and even of fringe\nrealms to this plane. A maskweaver guides\ntheir tribe and serves as an intermediary for the\nspirits as part ambassador, part medium. They\ncreate the masks that serve as symbolic tools\nwhen dealing with the spirits and help their\ntribal warriors forge the tethering bonds with\ntheir mounts. Like the [[Greensingers]], the Talenta\n[[druid]]s often deal with the [[fey]] but, unlike their\n[[Eldeen|Eldeen Reaches]] counterparts, the maskweavers see no\ndistinction between purely natural spirits, the\nghosts of their ancestors, or the fey.
