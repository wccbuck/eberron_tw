        "text": "Maskweavers are the shamans of the [[Talenta|Talenta Plains]] [[halfling]]s. The Talentans believe that the environs around them are filled with the spirits of their ancestors, spirits of nature, and even of fringe realms to this plane. A maskweaver guides their tribe and serves as an intermediary for the spirits as part ambassador, part medium. They create the masks that serve as symbolic tools when dealing with the spirits and help their tribal warriors forge the tethering bonds with their mounts. Like the [[Greensingers]], the Talenta [[druid]]s often deal with the [[fey]] but, unlike their [[Eldeen|Eldeen Reaches]] counterparts, the maskweavers see no distinction between purely natural spirits, the ghosts of their ancestors, or the fey. \n\nLike the magic of the [[Tolashcara]], the system of [[primal magic]] wielded by maskweavers is closely tied to the spirits of the [[Talenta Plains]] themselves, and it typically ceases to function outside of that realm. Only exceptional maskweaver druids are able to maintain their connection to the spirits of Talenta while traveling abroad.",
