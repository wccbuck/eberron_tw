Korbis is the intelligence expert of the [[Boromar Clan]] and [[Saidan|Saidan Boromar]]'s chief advisor. He is the lone non-[[halfling]] in the Boromars' inner circle. Saidan expects Korbis to come up with a solution to the problem of [[Daask]], but so far none of his ideas have worked, and the gnome worries he may find himself at the bottom of the [[Dagger River]] if he doesn't come up with an idea soon.
