While the lamia often appears in folklore as a snake-human hybrid, this document uses the default D&D 5e lore mixed with details from Edward Topsell's //History of Four-Footed Beasts and Serpents// (1658), which you can read about [[here|https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251730085_Geology_and_the_dark_side#pf8]].
