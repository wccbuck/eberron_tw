        "text": "Lathon Halpum is the chief [[lath]] of the [[Talenta Plains]] and holds the power to render decisions for the nation as a whole. Halpum organized the tribes during the [[Last War]] and represented them as the nation of the [[Talenta Plains]] in the [[negotiations|Treaty of Thronehold]] at [[Thronehold]]. He is considered the father of this land, and without his example, the [[halfling]] nation would likely never have come to pass. He has since stepped down from his position; Halpum still carries the grand title, but more as an honorary post than as a ruler. He continues to oversee his own tribe, one of the largest in the Plains, but he doesnâ€™t command the other laths. But he has the respect of nearly every living halfling.",
