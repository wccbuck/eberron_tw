title: Aelia's tonic
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This foul, murky liquid is
served at [[Nightshade]] in [[Shae Lias]]. It is designed
to complement [[darkeye]], enhancing the strength of
the visions—though also increasing the risk to the
drinker. A character who consumes a glass of Aelia’s
tonic is particularly susceptible to ingested poisons for the next hour.

Aelia’s tonic has a strong and extremely unpleasant flavor.
