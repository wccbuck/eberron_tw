title: gauntlets of sacrifice
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This pair of gauntlets are made of plates of tarnished iron and a deep black leather made from [[Mabar]]an [[quintessence]]. The wearer can sacrifice some of their own life force to the gauntlets in exchange for enhanced strength and dexterity in battle. The more life sacrificed, the greater the bonus. The wearer can make the sacrifice as often as they like, but the effects only last for ten minutes.
