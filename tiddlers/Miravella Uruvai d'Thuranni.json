        "text": "The head of [[Thuranni]] in [[Stormreach]], a powerful [[wizard]] and [[necromancer|necromancy]] named Lady Miravella, has more important matters on her mind than to extort minor secrets from the patrons of [[Shadows]]. In order to attend to these matters, she requires the freedom and anonymity that neutrality and innocuousness provide. More important, she needs the city’s wealthy\nand powerful—the [[Storm Lords]] and the other [[dragonmarked house]]s in particular—to realize that she knows as much as she does and yet still stays out of their\naffairs. This détente of sorts provides the very freedom\nthat she and her family members require.\n\nThat is not to say that Lady Miravella shies away\nfrom the work for which her house is known; she\naccepts the occasional bid for assassination or other\ndirty work, but she chooses such jobs carefully and\nalmost always turns down requests to rid the city of\none of its most public or powerful figures. When she\ndoes take on such a job, she typically sends her nephew\n[[Vaedin|Vaedin Uruvai d'Thuranni]], a gifted killer who never leaves a trace.\nFor internal security, she relies on her other nephew,\n[[Jaye|Jaye Uruvai d'Thuranni]], who is always on the lookout for the intrusive\nsnoopings of House [[Phiarlan]]’s [[Serpentine Table]] and its many agents.\n\nLady Miravella is the head of the [[Uruvai family]] in [[Stormreach]] and leads their secret agenda.",
