They are seen as the living embodiment of Aerenal and the conduit for the power of the [[Undying Court]].\n\nBy ancient tradition, the nation must be ruled by a bonded brother and sister. But the Sibling Kings are typically part of the same [[noble line|Aereni noble line]], but only symbolically blood siblings.\n\nFor most of the history of [[Aerenal]], the [[Mendyrian]] noble line has been the source and seat of the Sibling Kings.",
