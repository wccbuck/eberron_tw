This segmented [[mithral]] whip was once used by a mighty monster hunter. The whip has 7 runes on its handle that correspond to different damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, radiant, or necrotic. When you hit a creature using this weapon, you can channel 1 or more of the runes to deal extra damage of the type or types you choose. Once you add a damage type to an attack in this way, you can't add that type again until the following dawn.
