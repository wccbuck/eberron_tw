The practice of [[necromancy]] is forbidden among the [[dragon]]s of [[Argonnessen]], but Arstyvrax is one of this landâ€™s foremost practitioners of the dark art. He is one of a dozen members of the [[Shadowmasters]]. But what not even the other Shadowmasters suspect is that Arstyvrax has a very different purpose to his studies. He is secretly a [[vampire]], having been transformed two hundred years past while doing fieldwork in [[Xen'drik]] near the [[Ring of Storms]].
