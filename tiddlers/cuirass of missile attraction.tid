This plain steel breastplate is studded with dents and holes from arrowheads. Once donned, the armor can only be removed by magical means, such as the [[remove curse]] spell. All projectiles that pass within 15 feet of the wearer, such as arrows, rocks, and magical missiles, curve in midair to hit the wearer.
