A towering wall of water that drags ships down to the ocean's depths and washes away coastal settlementsâ€”that phenomenon typifies the destruction a leviathan can unleash on the world. 

Leviathans are only natively found in the [[Endless Ocean]] of [[Lamannia]]. If called forth into the Material Plane, a leviathan arises from a large body of water to form an immense serpent-shaped creature.
