Jairan still plays the role of the proud noble, attending social functions in his fine clothes, but he lost his fortune on the Day of [[Mourning]] and his [[glamerweave]] doublets are becoming increasingly threadbare. Jairan is an optimist, and he believes that somehow if he keeps doing his job [[Cyre]] will be restored—that [[New Cyre]] can peacefully grow, and perhaps reclaim\nthe blasted [[Mournland]].\n\nJairan usually travels with his bodyguard [[Holt]].",
