!! Tornadoes Emerge From Mournland

[[STARILASKUR|Starilaskur]]—Strangely persistent tornadoes have emerged from the [[Mournland]] this week, destroying barns and farmhouses in their wake.

The tornadoes appeared during sunny, cloudless weather, heading west toward [[Sterngate]] and through the hills south of [[New Cyre]]. Unlike weather-related tornadoes, these [[Mournland]] tornadoes often remain stationary for hours at a time, then lurch forward without warning. They move only during the daytime.

Thus far, they’ve only menaced some farms and small thorps. But all of eastern [[Breland]] worries that the tornadoes will continue to move east and threaten more heavily populated areas.

“We’re used to all sorts of strange things coming out of the [[Mournland]],” said [[Sterngate]]-area farmer Nezberro Lallick. “But we’ve never seen anything like this. I’ve got riders that watch the borders for monsters and the like, but these cyclones aren’t like zombies or whatever crawls out of the Mournland.”

“How can you fight off a tornado? It turned my barn into kindling,” he said.

A proclamation from Prince [[Oargev ir'Wynarn]] reported the dispatch of [[New Cyran|New Cyre]] cavalry to the vicinity of the cyclones. Sages are being consulted for further countermeasures, the proclamation said.

!! "War Widow" Land Grant Lottery Set for 28th of Barrakas

[[FAIRHAVEN|Fairhaven]]—Queen [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]] of [[Aundair]] has set a date for the long-anticipated land-grant lottery: the 28th of Barrakas.

A court decree on Far set a date and drawing procedure for the lottery, set to take place at noon in [[Fairhold]]’s Vermillion Pavilion. But the decree noted that some eligibility requirements for specific land parcels are still under review, leaving unclear who’ll be able to place lots for some of the more sought-after properties.

Although it’s widely referred to as the “war widow” lottery, only some parcels are designated specifically for widows of soldiers who fell in [[Aundair]]’s service during the [[Last War]]. Preliminary drafts of the lottery parcel list have shown a wide array of eligibility requirements. Many parcels will be given to those with relatives lost in the [[Last War]], while others are set aside for Aundair’s veterans. Most of the prime parcels have additional requirements of noble title, sometimes of specific families living nearby.

While the crown decree takes pains to point out the Queen’s generosity in giving away large tracts of land, the land-grant lottery is expected to fill Aundair’s coffers in the long-term. Many of the parcels in the lottery are crumbling, vacant castles with significant upkeep costs and no arable land nearby. Once removed from the crown’s rolls, the land parcels become taxable property once again. Thus the crown is both spared upkeep and may garner revenue from the land-grant lottery.

The land-grant lottery was originally scheduled for last month, but has been twice delayed as Aundairian courts adjudicated claims from distant relatives and other parties seeking to keep specific parcels out of the lottery. In many cases, ownership of a parcel fell to the crown when its owner died in the war and no inheritor was available. But once a parcel appears on the list for the lottery, “second cousins, secret wives, and every con artist in [[Aundair]] have come out of the woodwork” to make an ownership claim, said one magistrate speaking on condition of anonymity.

!! Karrnathi Laborers Make Grisly Find

[[KORTH|Korth]]—Laborers regrading the cliffs south of [[Vurgenslye]] have unearthed more than one hundred humanoid skeletons—all bearing the same injury.

Each skull found over the course of the last two weeks has had a three-inch circular hole carved in the center of the forehead. The rest of the skeletons had no unusual markings.

Nearly one-third of the 400 laborers have walked off the job, said foreman Jerrit Alpach.

“It’s a bit better now that we’re working further north, but for a while last week you would find one of these skeletons every ten minutes or so,” he said. You’d turn over a spadeful of earth, and there’d be a three-eyed skull staring up at you.”

Preliminary [[divination]] magic performed on the site indicated that the skulls were buried there shortly before the start of the [[Last War]]. Priests of the [[Blood of Vol]] have taken custody of the skulls for further study.

Nearby residents recall no unusual disappearances or murders during the time when the skulls would have been buried.

The cliffs south of [[Vurgenslye]] have long been locally known for their frequent, treacherous mudslides. The regrade effort is a massive undertaking to turn the cliffs into a gentle, farmable slope leading down to [[Scions Sound]].
