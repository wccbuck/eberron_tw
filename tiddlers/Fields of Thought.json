[[Varr|varr]] farmers dance as they tend the fields, but what they cultivate are emotions; anyone walking through a field feels a powerful emotion (fear, sorrow, anger, guilt) washing over them. Each field has an outpost containing an [[elder brain]], with a bright line of thought transmitting the emotions to Dyrrn's tower at the heart of the layer.\n\nDyrrn's tower is made of glowing threads of pure thought\nintertwined around a massive steel spinal column. This tower\nis filled with the tools of fleshcrafting. There are pools of\nblood and canals of amniotic fluid, massive pulsing organs\nwaiting for a purpose, and untended tendrils crawling across\nthe floor. Adventurers might find a chamber that contains half-formed clones of the adventurers themselves... or perhaps the\nclones are completed, and consider the adventurers to be evil\n[[doppelganger]]s.\n\nThe spire amplifies Dyrrn's telepathic abilities, letting it\nsense all living creatures within the layer. Dyrrn specializes\nin corruption, and it may challenge adventurers with mental\nprojections, such as people plucked from their memories, who\nseek to turn them against their allies.",
