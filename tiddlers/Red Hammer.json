        "text": "This unusual business is an innâ€”for [[warforged]]. Warforged do not need to eat,\ndrink, or sleep, but they can still hunger for camaraderie. The Red Hammer is a place for warforged to gather, make new friends, and exchange stories. The Hammer is owned by two warforged, Blue and Crucible. The official story is that Blue bought the Hammer with a cache of gold she found during the [[Last War]], but in truth it\nwas paid for by [[Merrix d'Cannith]]. Crucible is one of Merrix's experimental warforged produced in [[Sharn]], and Merrix also wants to provide the warforged with an outlet for social development. Blue and Crucible are on good terms with [[Weld]], and both support his views as opposed to those of the [[Lord of Blades]].\n\nIn addition to companionship, the Hammer is a source for repairs and cosmetic improvement for [[warforged]]; costs are equivalent to those of a house of healing.
