title: dream shard
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The [[kalashtar]] do not dream, but they
can see the [[Region of Dreams|Dal Quor]] through the memories of
their [[quori]] ancestors. Dream shards are Eberron [[dragonshard]]s that have
been adapted to hold mental images. A dreamshaper
weaves their dreams into the shard. [[Psionically|psionics]] focused
characters can access the dream by touching the shard;
other characters have vague flashes of emotion and
images when standing close to the shard. [[Adaran|Adar]]
monasteries and temples often contain crystal mosaics
composed of the thoughts and dreams of those who
have gone before.
