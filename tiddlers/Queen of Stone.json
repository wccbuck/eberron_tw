Less cruel\nthan her fellow warlords, Sheska is driven to secure\nthe well-being of her people, and she has earned\ntheir devotion and fealty. She could be a potential\nally for PCsâ€”or a deadly enemy if she considers them\na threat.\n\nHer title is more than an epithet. As the Queen of Stone, Sheshka hears the whisper of marble and granite, and can freely shape it to her whim. With a gaze, she can transmute creatures into obsidian, mud, [[byeshk]], or other materials of the earth. Her gifts are amplified by her regalia, especially her silver collar.\n\nA medusa named ''Carash'' serves as the queen's ambassador in the court of the [[Great Crag]].",
