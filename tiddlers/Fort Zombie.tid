Fort Zombie is a fortress in [[Karrnath]] that was built to guard the border with [[Cyre]]. Today it stands thirty miles from the wall of [[dead-gray mists]] that cover the [[Mournland]]. Like [[Fort Bones]], Fort Zombie was the site of [[necromantic|necromancy]] research during the [[Last War]].

On the Day of [[Mourning]], [[warforged]] soldiers guarding Fort Zombie abandoned their posts and marched across the [[Cyre River]] to found the mysterious [[Becoming God]] cult.
