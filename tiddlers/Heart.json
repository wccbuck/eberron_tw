This area is dominated by the [[Tharashk]] enclave and its associated businesses and barracks. The [[dragonshard]]\nrefineries are deeper in the Marches, but at any given\ntime the vaults of the Heart hold a fortune in shards\nwaiting to be shipped to the east. The [[enclave]] of\nZarash’ak is the home of the [[Tharashk triumvirate]],\nwhich sets the overall vision for the house. It is also\nthe seat of the [[Finders Guild]], and many Tharashk\nheirs learn to harness their mystical gifts in the Heart\nof Zarash’ak.\n\nAlso in the Heart of [[Zarash'ak]]:\n\n* A [[Lyrandar]] [[airship]] tower\n* A [[Sivis]] [[message station|speaking stone]]\n* A [[Gold Dragon Inn]]\n* A small [[Riedra]]n outpost, helmed by [[Inspired]] Ambassador Sosharani\n\nThe Heart of Zarash'ak is surrounded by the [[Ring]].",
