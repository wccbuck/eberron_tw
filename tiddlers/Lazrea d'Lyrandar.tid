type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

One of the most recognized captains who passes through [[Stormreach]]'s [[Falconer's Spire]] is Lazrea dâ€™Lyrandar, known both for her beauty and her
love of dueling with those who offend her. Lord [[Calynden|Calynden d'Lyrandar]] has been using her to manipulate [[Jonas Wylkes]], and so far Lazrea has no objections to romancing the handsome Harbor Lord. However, if she discovers proof that Calynden was behind the death of Graden [[Wylkes|Wylkes family]], she could turn against him. Like many of the
children of [[Lyrandar]], Lazrea is a free spirit. If it turns out that the Kraken has dark plans, Lazrea could be a valuable ally to the PCs.
