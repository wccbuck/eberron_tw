The\nhalflings domesticated the dinosaurs of the plains and\nuse these creatures as mounts, livestock, and beasts\nof burden. A sacred bond exists between a hunter and\nmount or a [[spirit rider]] and [[glidewing]], and few people are prepared to face a raging halfling barbarian riding a furious [[clawfoot]] raptor.\n\nTalenta religion reveres spirits, both departed ancestors and natural spirits. Each tribe has a lath—a chieftain who guides the tribe—and shamans who consult\nthe spirits and choose the paths of migration.\n\nIn the past, the tribes stood alone, but during the Last\nWar, many halflings came together under [[Lathon Halpum]] to defend their land. Halpum won recognition for\nthe Plains as one of the [[Thronehold nations|Treaty of Thronehold]], though it's\nstill unclear what this means beyond increasing passage\nbetween the Plains and the outside world. \n\n!! Interesting Things About {{!!article}}{{!!title}}\n\n* House [[Ghallanda]] and House [[Jorasco]] both originated in the Talenta Plains. The [[dragonmark]]ed bloodlines appear throughout the tribes, though you can play a dragonmarked halfling from the Plains who doesn't work for the houses. \n* The Talentan reverence for spirits derives from the fact that a variety of spirits haunt the Plains. The region contains an unusual number of manifest zones tied to [[Dolurrh]] and [[Thelanis]]. Ghosts are more likely to linger in such places, and minor fey are scattered across the Plains.\n* Stories tell of ancient ruins that date back to the first age of the world and of a vast graveyard holding the bones of [[dragon]]s. \n\n!! Talentan Characters\n\n* ''Wild Warriors and Tricksters.'' You were born in the wild, and your wits and your weapons helped you survive. Talenta warriors are often barbarians or rangers, relying on speed and skill. Outlander is a logical background, but you could easily be a folk hero, entertainer, or charlatan. You could even be an urchin who was stranded in a great city and adapted to life there.\n* ''Surrounded by Spirits.'' Fey, fiends, and the ghosts of ancestors, these are all part of the spirit world, and they're all around you. Do you believe that the spirits guide your actions? Do you show respect to the spirits of a location? Talentan shamans often shapeshift into the form of dinosaurs. You could also reflect a strong bond to spirits by playing a [[warlock]] with an [[archfey]] patron, a [[cleric]] with the Nature domain, a [[paladin]] sworn to the Oath of the Ancients, or a barbarian on the Path of the Totem Warrior or Path of the Ancestral Guardian. Hermit and outlander are natural backgrounds, but you could be an acolyte or a sage who consults spirits instead of books. Warriors and shamans both wear masks to present a particular face to the spirit world.\n* ''Dinosaurs.'' Talenta halflings have a close bond to their [[dinosaur]] companions. If you don't begin the campaign with a dinosaur mount or companion, you might acquire one over the course of your adventures. You can also consider whether a fallen dinosaur is part of your backstory; perhaps you lost your faithful mount in the [[Last War]], but you believe its spirit is still with you. \n\n!! Cities and Sites\n\nThe Talenta Plains have been described as an ocean of\ngrasslands. The nomadic halflings have little interest\nin building towns; most shelter in the Talenta Plains is\ntemporary. Halflings shun the ruins scattered across the\nPlains, believing them to be haunted by [[fiend]]s.\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[location]sort[title]]\">>\n\n!! Aftermath of the Last War\n\nThe [[halfling]] tribes joined together to defend themselves\nfrom outsiders, and the Talenta Plains were recognized\nas a nation under the [[Treaty of Thronehold]]. Now that\nthe war is over, most of the tribes have returned to their\nhunting grounds and ancient traditions. They united to\ndefend their way of life, and now they wish to enjoy it.\n\nBut the halflings don't yet know if it's possible to\nreturn to the previous ways. More foreigners visit\nthe Plains than at any time in the past. Settlers and\nmerchants cross the Plains as they make their way to\n[[Q'barra]], and they clash with Q'barran bandits. The [[Valenar]] [[elves|elf]] ride through the Plains in search of adventure.\nMonsters emerge from the [[Mournland]]. [[Dragonmarked houses|dragonmarked house]] seek to expand their role at [[Gatherhold]] and to\nexplore the untapped resources of the Plains.\n\nThe halflings have no interest in change, but it might\nbe inevitable. [[Lathon Halpum]] believes that if the tribes\ncan work together, they could become a nation of nations, but others aggressively oppose such a path. [[Holy Uldra]] is a powerful shaman and the leader of her own\ntribe. She urges halfling warriors to join together for a\nsingle purpose: to drive all outsiders from the Plains\nand to maintain the ancient traditions. The halflings\nmust decide whether the tribes will choose the path of\npeace or return to war. ",
