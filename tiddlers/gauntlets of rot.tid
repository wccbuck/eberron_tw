type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This pair of gauntlets is covered in black scales that glitter with a violet sheen. While wearing these gauntlets, the wearer can speak a command word to shroud the gauntlets and whatever weapon they are holding in a faint black mist. Anything attacked by this weapon rapidly decays, suffering additional necrotic damage. Any small plants or animals touched by the gauntlets while they are active immediately wilt away and die.
