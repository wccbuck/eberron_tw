This pair of gauntlets is covered in black scales that glitter with a violet sheen. While wearing these gauntlets, the wearer can speak a command word to shroud the gauntlets and whatever weapon they are holding in a faint black mist. Anything attacked by this weapon rapidly decays, suffering additional [[necrotic damage|damage type]]. Any small plants or animals touched by the gauntlets while they are active immediately wilt away and die.
