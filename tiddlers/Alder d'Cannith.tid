Architect and [[wizard]] Alder d'Cannith was responsible for the design and construction of the [[Ziggurat of the Twelve]], as well as the naming of the [[Twelve]] organization at its founding fifteen hundred years ago. Though there were only ten [[dragonmarked house]]s at the time, Alder convinced the committee to name the
institute the Twelve, based on his belief that there were
twelve true [[dragonmark]]s in addition to the shattered [[Mark of Death]]. Alder was a brilliant man whose works had played
a critical role in the [[War of the Mark]], and the members
of the committee humored him—though few expected
the remaining two marks to appear. (The remaining two
marks, [[Warding|Mark of Warding]] and [[Finding|Mark of Finding]], were not “discovered” until after the creation of the Kingdom of [[Galifar]].)

Alder d'Cannith designed the original forgeholds of House [[Cannith]], many of which remain in operation to the present day. He also developed the earliest form of the modern [[magecraft]] spell, as well as pioneering techniques of spell preparation and aspects of [[artifice|artificer]].
