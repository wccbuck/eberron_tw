Beren’s Hearth was a legendary inn located in a [[Fernia]]n [[manifest zone]] in the ancient kingdom of [[Wroat]] (modern-day [[Breland]]). The innkeeper Beren had crafted [[externalist|Externalist Theory]] spells allowing him to channel the power of [[Fernia]] to heat food and the inn itself. According to the tales, when a group of bandits threatened Beren and his guests, the innkeeper called the fire out of the hearth, and it chased down his enemies and burned them. To this day, [[Brelish|Breland]] [[wizard]]s often call [[flaming sphere]] “Beren’s blaze” and [[fire bolt]] “Beren’s blast.” 

According to the tales, Beren’s Hearth finally burnt down and the land was claimed for a [[Cannith]] foundry. There are many conflicting accounts of just where the Hearth was, and some who say that it was the [[Twelve]]—notably agents of [[Ghallanda]] and [[Cannith]]—who burned down the Hearth.
