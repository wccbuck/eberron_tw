type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A single [[grist]] mill is in the [[Little Graywall]], and most of the inhabitants dine there or
make meals within their warrens. However, one inn has gained a measure of renown throughout [[Graywall]]. Bahiri is remarkably fat for a [[goblin]]; he
is also a talented chef skilled in both [[Droaam]]ish and
[[Talentan|Talenta Plains]] cuisines. Thanks to under-the-table deals
he gets prime materials from the [[Skin Factory]] in
[[Bloodstone]], and his Talentan preparations might be the most palatable food an easterner can find outside the [[Twilight Palace]]. 

Bahiri has rooms for rent, and there are a few [[gnome]] and [[halfling]] exiles who make
their homes here. Some believe that Bahiri’s is a center for intrigue; there are rumors that the [[gnome]] who calls herself Shiv is a top agent of the [[Trust]], and that Bahiri himself is a master spy from the [[Shaarat'khesh|Khesh'dar]]. These things might be true, or they might be pure fantasy. But if one is looking for a good meal accompanied by goblin song and cheerful company, Bahiri’s is a fine choice. Bahiri does keep [[blood gin]]
on hand for foreigners, but he does not sell the drug to [[goblin]]s.
