        "text": "The Towering Wood is the massive primeval forest that covers most of the area of the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. It is vast and untamed. The [[Wardens of the Wood]] seek to protect travelers, but swathes of forest remain entirely untouched by [[human]] or [[shifter]]. Such areas could hold giant beasts never seen in the outside world, or relics from a previous ageâ€”artifacts or ruins created by [[demon]]s or the terrifying [[daelkyr]].\n\nThe Towering Wood includes the [[Gloaming]] and the [[Twilight Demesne]].",
