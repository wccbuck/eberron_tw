        "text": "Founded on principles of freedom and a sharp disdain for what they see as oppressive monarchies across the continent of [[Khorvaire]], the Swords of Liberty emerged in the near the midpoint of the [[Last War]] and began causing trouble both in [[Breland]] and throughout the [[Five Nations]]. In the new peace, their numbers swell, as does their violence. They now foment war, staging attacks and raids, murdering\nand burning villages to draw Breland into war once\nagain. The Swords believe that Breland was strong\nenough to win the Last War outright and that the\nother nations are too weakened and too afraid to put\nup much of a fight now. This view might be truer than\nthe other nations would like to believe.\n\nDifferent cells of the Swords approach their goals in different ways, and often have different scopes for their agendas. Some cells put democracy first, opposed to the feudal system of the [[Five Nations]], and are actively working to topple monarchies across Khorvaire. Others are Brelish supremacists, interested only in perfecting their own nation.\n\nIn the western regions of [[Breland]], many Sword cells are led by a mysterious individual who has taken the moniker [[Beggar Dane|Beggar Dane (Swords of Liberty)]], who is likely operating in secret somewhere in the western frontier of [[Breland]]. Another powerful cell leader known only as [[Red Owl]] is believed to be headquartered somewhere in [[Xandrar]].\n\nThe Swords of Liberty began as a peaceful political movement, calling for King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] to voluntarily cede power to the [[Brelish parliament|Breland Parliament]]. In 996 YK, a statement from [[Beggar Dane|Beggar Dane (Swords of Liberty)]] took credit for an attack on [[Castle Arakhain]] that left the east wing of the Winter Palace in flames. Over the last two years, the Swords of Liberty have struck at nobles across [[Breland]], saying that there will be no peace until the aristocracy is dissolved.\n\n!! The Swords in Graywall\n\nPCs who sympathize with the Swords of Liberty can come to [[Graywall]] to make contact with [[Tars Faldren]], one of the founding members of the movement. Alternatively, the [[King's Citadel]] could ask the party to infiltrate the Swords and shut them down—but only after learning about upcoming plans and Faldren’s contacts within [[Breland]].\n\nFaldren’s safe house is hidden within [[Bloodstone]]. He is accompanied by a number of Swords, including new recruits, bodyguards (such as the [[dwarf]] [[Norn]]), and a few others who have been exposed and are wanted in [[Breland]]. Chief among these is [[Tolri]], a [[tiefling]] [[wizard]] infamous for her skill at crafting ritual scrolls that set off terrible explosions.",
