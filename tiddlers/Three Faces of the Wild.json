        "text": "The [[Three Faces]] of the Wild is a mystery cult within the [[Five Nations]] which honors [[Arawai]], [[Balinor]], and Shargon (the [[Devourer]]). Sects are usually found in rural\ncommunities, and include farmers, hunters, and all manner of\nwanderers. The Three Faces of the Wild supports agriculture\nand hunting, but recognizes that the wild cannot be fully\ntamed.\n\nFollowers of the Three Faces of the Wild sometimes engage in ritual sacrifices or the\nburning of fields or other acts of destruction. They believe that the [[Devourer]] must have his due—and by making their chosen offerings, they keep him from striking elsewhere. However, they recognize that many disasters can be avoided simply by understanding the interactions between civilization and nature. When a village suffers severe floods, rather than cursing the [[Devourer]], perhaps don’t build your village in a flood plain. Followers of the Three Faces practice free range grazing and low-impact farming, and oppose techniques that they see as causing lasting harm to the world. This often leads them to oppose industrial advances that they see as threatening to the natural world, and there have been clashes between Three Faces sects and House [[Vadalis]] or House [[Cannith]] [[enclave]]s, not to mention mundane damming and logging operations. Outright violence is rare; the sect prefers to solve problems with diplomacy. However, this is still a potential source of ecological conflict in the heart of the [[Five Nations]]—and dangerous zealots can take root in an otherwise benevolent branch of this sect.",
