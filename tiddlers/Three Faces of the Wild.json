Sects are usually found in rural\ncommunities, and include farmers, hunters, and all manner of\nwanderers. The Three Faces of the Wild supports agriculture\nand hunting, but recognizes that the wild cannot be fully\ntamed. Members sometimes engage in ritual sacrifices or the\nburning of fields or other acts of destruction. They believe that\nthe Devourer must have his dueâ€”and by making their chosen\nofferings, they keep him from striking elsewhere.",
