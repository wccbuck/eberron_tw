Carved into the mountainside, this mile-high stone face is an incredible marvel of engineering that is at least as old as the city, and [[Korranberg|Library of Korranberg]] sages argue over how the dwarves of old could possibly have created this marvel. Some say that they must have sculpted down a larger image. For evidence, they point to obscure references to \"the [[Face of Eberron]]\" and other marvels of the [[dragon]]s that date back to the [[Age of Demons]].",
