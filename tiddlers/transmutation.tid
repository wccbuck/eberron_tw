tooltip: school of magic which transforms energy and matter into new forms
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A student of transmutation casts spells that modify energy and matter.
To them, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently
mutable. They wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both
physical forms and mental qualities. Their magic gives
them the tools to become a smith on reality's forge.

Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters,
turning people into toads and transforming copper into
silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their
magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the
power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.
