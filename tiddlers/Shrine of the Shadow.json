Here, necromancers and other evil [[wizard]]s gather in secret to revere the power of magic perverted to evil ends, led by a [[cleric]]/[[necromancer|necromancy]] named Thalanna. This secretive cult has no grand evil schemes for\nworld domination; they exist purely to worship their\npatron deity and hide only to escape persecution.",
