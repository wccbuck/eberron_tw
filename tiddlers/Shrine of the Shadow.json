[[Aureon]], the king, the judge, the teacher… the world is filled with people telling you what to do, people who want to impose their laws on your life. They say the Shadow urges you to do evil, but who decides what’s evil? The Shadow wants you to achieve your full potential, to live your best life—not to be limited by lesser people and their laws. And if that makes you a “monster” in their eyes, so be it.//\n<div align=\"right\">—[[Thalanna]] of [[Sharn]]</div>\n\nHidden down a dark alley, the shrine of the [[Shadow]] represents the dark side of [[Everbright]]. Here, [[necromancers|necromancy]] and other evil [[wizard]]s gather in secret to revere the power of magic perverted to evil ends, led by a [[cleric]] named [[Thalanna]]. This secretive cult has no grand evil schemes for world domination; they exist purely to worship their patron deity and hide only to escape persecution.\n\n",
