The Vanalan family has deep roots in [[Rekkenmark]], and Asta is working to impose more traditional Karrnathi culture on the [[kleynam]]s within her domain; this includes an effort to convince Karrns from the west to resettle in the region. As a warlord, Asta has passed the daily duties of command of [[Deepdark|Fort Deepdark]] to commander [[Brandin ir'Dulinch]], but Deepdark remains the seat of her power.",
