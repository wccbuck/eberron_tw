The blade of this axe is made completely of frosted glass, covered with steaming frost. Anyone struck by this axe takes additional [[cold damage|damage type]]. The axe has a chance to shatter whenever it hits a solid surface, piercing the target with shards of needle-sharp glass. The broken blade regrows each night, under the light of the moons.
