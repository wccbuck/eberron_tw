        "text": "After the destruction of the [[line|Aereni noble line]] of [[Vol]], not all of the [[Aereni]] refugees sought shelter in the shadow of the [[Fingerbones|Farlnen]]. Some fully embraced [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] culture, mingling with [[human]]s and creating a significant population of [[half-elves|half-elf]], particularly on the island of [[Orthoss]]. While some of these Khoravar carried the [[Mark of Storm]], they held no principality of their own until a decade ago when Prince [[Koulton Brightwind]] stole an early [[airship]] from House [[Lyrandar]], flew it to [[Orthoss]] and recruited a crew out of [[Blackrock]], which quickly grew into the Wind Whisperer principality of today.\n\nMembers of this small principality are as wild and unpredictable as the wind itself. They often help travelers in distress, but are known for raiding or otherwise interfering with [[Lyrandar]] vessels. Many of those who develop the [[Mark of Storm]] outside of House Lyrandar find their way to the Wind Whisperers. \n\nThe Wind Whisperers have seven ships, including Koulton's stolen [[airship]] and two [[elemental galleon]]s. The remaining four ships are small and fast, and not as powerful as [[Bloodsail|Bloodsails]] or [[Seadragon|Seadragons]] warships.",
