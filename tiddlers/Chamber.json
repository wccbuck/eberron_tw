        "text": "Conspiracy theorists insist that a network of [[dragon]]s is hidden in [[Khorvaire]], and these mighty creatures use powerful magic and [[humanoid]] agents to work their will across the continent and beyond. These claims are usually dismissed as madness, but they are in fact correct. The Chamber is a cabal of dragons that have monitored\nKhorvaire for over two thousand years, treating humanoids as pawns in an ancient game.\n\nFirst and foremost, the [[dragon]]s of the Chamber (or \"Calemaryx\" in [[Draconic]]) are\nobservers, gathering information about new aspects of the [[Draconic Prophecy]] and sharing it with their elders in [[Argonnessen]]. They are also charged with stopping any creature that seeks to use the Prophecy for its own ends.\nThis responsibility sets them against the [[Lords of Dust]],\nwho must manipulate the Prophecy in order to release\ntheir fiendish [[overlord]]s. It also leads them to recruit\nor eliminate any humanoid who learns too much about\nthe Prophecy.\n\nThe Chamber is loosely organized. Each dragon monitors its own small corner of the world and maintains a network of humanoid agents. Although the mission of\nthe Chamber is one of observation, individual dragons\noften have their own agendas. Some seek to manipulate the Prophecy personally, directing the future along a particular path. Others conduct experiments\non [[dragonmark]]ed humanoids, trying to understand the\nconnection between these creatures and the [[Prophecy|Draconic Prophecy]].\nStill others are obsessed with the [[Lords of Dust]] engage in century-spanning games of cat-and-mouse with their\nfiendish counterparts. In general, the Chamber seeks to\nmaintain the status quo and opposes [[demon]]s, so agents\nof the Chamber can often be useful allies or patrons.\nBut ultimately [[humanoid]]s are just pawns in the dragons'\neyes, and they readily sacrifice any of those pawns to\nensure the sanctity of the Prophecy and the defeat of the\nLords of Dust.\n\n!!

Seekers of Vectors\n\nSpies and agents of the Chamber are scattered across [[Khorvaire]]. Allies within the Chamber share safe houses and even secret identities. For example, “[[Sentinel Marshal|Sentinel Marshals]] Sorgan d’Deneith” is a persona used by six different [[dragon]]s; as a Marshal, Sorgan can show up anywhere in [[Karrnath]] and receive cooperation from local forces.\n\nIn some cases, these false faces belong to mortals who were killed so that the dragons could claim their identities; in others, the person is a willing participant in the masquerade. Some [[humanoid]] servant families have been working with draconic masters for generations. Family members rarely know the true nature of their patron, but they know it is a great being that has protected them from war and other misfortunes.\n\nThe dragons also make use of existing intelligence networks. Members of the Chamber hold influential positions in the [[King's Dark Lanterns]] of [[Breland]], the [[Royal Eyes]] of [[Aundair]], House [[Phiarlan]], House [[Tharashk]], and many more hierarchies. All these spies and agents use their positions to find new [[Prophecy|Draconic Prophecy]] marks, monitor the activities of [[dragonmarked|dragonmarked house]] heirs, and most of all, identify and track ''vectors''.\n\nVectors are the elements—living or inanimate—that play a role in a particular path of the Prophecy. Sometimes these elements are quite obvious; a segment of the Prophecy might indicate a specific individual, e.g. “If Boran d’[[Vadalis]] builds a farm above the ruins of Shakaal before a calf is conceived when [[Eberron]] embraces [[Kythri]], then the calf will be born with six legs.” But more typically, the Prophecy provides cryptic clues to vectors’ identities instead of names. For example, a vector called “the Child of Six Storms” could be a [[Lyrandar]] heir, perhaps one with six generations of dragonmarked parents. But they could also be a [[storm sorcerer|Storm Sorcerer]] whose powers emerge after being struck by lightning six times. The [[dragon]] attempting to follow this thread has to consider all possibilities.\n\nThe challenge for the Chamber is that despite the [[dragon]]s’ individual and collective power, the nature of their work forces them to remain in the background. They are like gardeners: Whether they actively choose which flowers to grow or simply try to keep vermin out, the effort is ultimately about the flowers. The Chamber can only watch and tend. If a branch of the Prophecy requires that [[Duke ir'Kesslan|Ven ir'Kesslan]] found [[Q'barra]], then Kesslan himself must complete that task: A dragon can guide him on the path, but killing Kesslan and taking his place would only destroy that branch. \n\n!! The Chamber and the War\n\nThe lives of humanoids and the welfare of their nations\nmean little to the ancient dragons. A member of the\nChamber who is friendly now might turn out to be little\nmore than a war criminal, responsible for horrible atrocities while directing critical events of the war to ensure\nthat a skirmish or an untimely assassination didn't derail some crucial stanza of the [[Prophecy|Draconic Prophecy]]. An even more\ndisturbing prospect is that the [[Mourning]] might have\nbeen orchestrated by the Chamber, either as part of its\nstruggle against the [[Lords of Dust]] or even directly in\nresponse to the dictates of the Prophecy.\n\nWhatever the truth, the [[Last War]]'s impact on the\nChamber was small in the grand scheme of things.\n[[Planar observatories|planar observatory]] were damaged here and there,\nhumanoid servants died in droves, and the clash of\narmies derailed short-term plans. But even the effects of\na hundred years of war are minor in the context of plans\nthat span continents and millennia. \n\n!! The Chamber in Argonnessen\n\nThe headquarters of the Chamber is located in the [[Tapestry]] of [[Argonnessen]]. The [[Conclave]] and the [[Eyes of Chronepsis]] both have\nserious doubts about the actions of the Chamber,\nand whether the cabal should be allowed to continue\nits work abroad. The surviving elders of the Chamber—the dragons who founded the movement over two thousand years ago—are now mighty ancient dragons (see <<navAndScrollToHeader \"dragon\" \"Dragon Age Categories\">>). While the younger dragons explore the\nworld, their elders fight to keep their order alive. The ancient dragons of the Chamber include accomplished prophets and [[loredrake]]s, and their insights into the\n[[Prophecy|Draconic Prophecy]] have helped to mollify the great powers of\n[[Argonnessen]]. But it is an ongoing struggle, with no\nrest for the wise.",
