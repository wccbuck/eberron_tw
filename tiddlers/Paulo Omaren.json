        "text": "Lady Paulo Omaren is a [[Storm Lord|Storm Lords]] of [[Stormreach]] and is determined to restore her [[family|Omaren family]]’s honor. She bears a special grudge toward Lord\n[[Yorrick|Yorrick Amanatu]] and the [[Amanatus|Amanatu family]]. Not only was the [[dwarf]] directly responsible for the death of Lord Castal during the [[Omaren Revolt]], but the Amanatus’ power is derived from the [[Stormreach Guard]]—soldiers outfitted by the [[Omaren|Omaren family]] [[forge|Stormreach Forge]]. Nonetheless, her thirst for power and vengeance is tempered by a wisdom her predecessors lacked. She knows that it will take more than ambition to unseat the Amanatus. She presents herself as an innovator, looking for new solutions to the challenges that face [[Stormreach]]. Lady Paulo has been working with [[Cannith]] South, allowing\nthe house to establish facilities inside the [[Foundry]] and\nthe [[Stormreach Forge]]. She approached the [[warforged]]\n[[Steeljack]] and created the [[Iron Watch]]; Lord [[Yorrick|Yorrick Amanatu]] might hold the loyalty of the [[Stormreach Guard]], but as the [[Iron Watch]] grows, so does Lady\nPaulo’s confidence. She has also fought to increase the power and influence of House [[Deneith]]. She has recently taken Lord [[Greigur d'Deneith]] as a lover, and she thinks of Deneith as her own personal army, just waiting for her command. Secretly, she envisions a day when the [[Iron Watch]] and House [[Deneith]] will sweep aside the [[Stormreach Guard]] and crown her the\nsole ruler of [[Stormreach]]. These dreams might never\ncome to pass; despite his genuine affection for her,\nLord Greigur has to balance his duties to his house\nand his own ambitions. But Lady Paulo’s alliance with\nhim gives her hope for the future, and for now that’s\nall she needs.\n\nWhatever comes of her current schemes, there\nis no question that Lady Paulo is the most ambitious\n[[Storm Lord|Storm Lords]] and that she is always looking for new\nsources of power. If a group of adventurers gains a\nreputation in [[Stormreach]], there’s an excellent chance\nthat Lady Paulo will seek out their services. The only\nquestion is whether she employs them openly—like\nthe [[Iron Watch]]—or seeks their assistance with more\nsecret matters.",
