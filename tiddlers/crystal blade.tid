This magic sword's blade is fashioned from a crystal infused with pure radiance. When you attack with this sword, the target suffers additional radiant damage.

While youâ€™re holding the sword, you can choose to cause it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet (or any range less than that), or to douse the light.
