title: Enidda's tea set
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This is a finely crafted child's toy tea set in a wooden case. To activate the tea set's magical properties, you must perform a 10 minute ritual in which you host an imaginary tea party. This requires having a solid, relatively flat surface in which to set up all parts of the tea set (a tablecloth, five plates, five cups, and a teapot). At the end of the ritual, you conjure four invisible servants, as if by the [[unseen servant]] spell. They disappear after 1 hour or until you choose to dismiss any number of them.
