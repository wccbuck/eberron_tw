title: Mark of Scribing
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Mark of Scribing deals with communicationâ€”both
the written and spoken word. A gnome who bears the
mark can //feel// words as though they are living creatures,
struggling to make their meaning known. The mark
provides a range of gifts. It translates [[language]]s, but it
also allows its bearer to communicate with others at
a distance. 

Only a [[gnome]] with ties to House [[Sivis]] can manifest this [[dragonmark]].
