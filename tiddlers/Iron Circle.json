        "text": "The Iron Circle is a troop of mercenaries that served [[Breland]] during the latter years of the [[Last War]], and primarily fought against the forces of [[Aundair]] and [[Thrane]]. The troop gained ignominy for their wanton cruelty and for engaging targets without orders, and their contract with the Brelish military was cancelled before the end of the war.\n\nToday, the Iron Circle is a wandering band of about 400 brigands who periodically raid small settlements in central [[Breland]] and then retreat into hiding. However, they have begun reconnaissance and preparations for a larger, bolder coordinated operation, setting their sights on a rural Brelish county. If they can take control of the keep, capture or kill the count, bribe the [[Municipal Guard|Breland Municipal Guard]], and stamp out militia resistance before it can mobilize, they can bleed the whole county dry before the Brelish government intervenes.\n\nIron Circle members are primarily [[human]], though other [[humanoid]] species can be found in the organization's ranks. They can be recognized by their signature black cloaks with grey circle emblems. New enlistees rise from the ranks of common thugs, thieves, and cutthroats, but some are elite fighters who are capable of planning and carrying out sophisticated tactical maneuvers. The Iron Circle also employs powerful mages who have forged infernal pacts with a [[mysterious great fiend|Bethageh]], and thus can summon and command [[tar devil]]s to fight on their behalf. The gang's recent plot to enact a high-profile takeover of a county may be driven by these dark covenants.\n\nThe Iron Circle is led by [[Nazin Redthorn]]. His lieutenants include [[Kaltis]] and [[Sturmik]].",
