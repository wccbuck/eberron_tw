A death dog is an ugly two-headed hound that roams plains and deserts, especially those close to [[manifest zone]]s to [[Mabar]]. Hate burns in a death dog's heart, and a taste for [[humanoid]] flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. Death dog saliva carries a foul [[disease]] that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot off the bone.
