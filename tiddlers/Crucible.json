        "text": "In this grand foundry, tended by [[shadar-kai]] and guarded by\nnewly forged [[marut]]s, the [[immortal]] spirit known as the Smith of Souls refines the essence of faded spirits into [[husksteel]].\nFrom these lingering scraps of memory and emotion, she forges the armor and weapons of the shadar-kai, and creates\nthe maruts from the husks of brave souls. She also creates\nsmaller and stranger items from husksteel.\n\nThe Smith wears a mask of black steel and an apron of\ndragonhide. When forging [[marut]]s, she takes the form of a\n[[giant]], and when crafting tiny trinkets, a [[gnome]]. It's possible\nthat she collects the memories of mortal artisans, and can\nreplicate their works at her forge.",
