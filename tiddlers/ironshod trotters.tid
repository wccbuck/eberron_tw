These boots have iron horseshoes embedded in their soles. When you sprint while wearing these boots, you move 50% faster. In addition, once per day, you can click the boots together to cast the [[polymorph]] spell on yourself to transform into a riding horse. The horse has a carrying capacity of 480 pounds. Any bags you were carrying to not meld into your new form, and are magically draped over your torso as saddlebags.
