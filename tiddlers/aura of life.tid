type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Life-preserving energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. For up to 10 minutes (or until your concentration breaks), the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each nonhostile, living creature in the aura (including you) has resistance to [[necrotic damage|damage type]] and other powers of death and decay. In addition, nonhostile, living creatures have additional resistance to any damage that would bring them to the edge of death.
