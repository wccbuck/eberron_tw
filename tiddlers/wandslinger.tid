Magic evolves. When [[Galifar I|Galifar Wynarn]] forged his [[kingdom|Galifar]], his [[wizard]]s
hadn't mastered [[fire bolt]] or [[ray of frost]]. The development of the
[[cantrip|spell]]—casual spells that can be used at will—took centuries,
as the [[Arcane Congress]] studied [[Aereni|Aerenal]] techniques and the
powers of [[sorcery|sorcerer]]. The soldiers of the united kingdom relied
on sword and bow. But as the [[Last War]] began, [[Aundair]] took
stock of its resources. Thanks to the presence of the Arcane Congress, Aundair led Galifar in mystical education. Assembling
the first regiment of arcane dragoons, Aundair developed the
[[war staff]] and [[battle rod]]. Over the course of the Last War, these
techniques spread across the [[Five Nations]] and beyond. Today
it's no surprise to see a tough [[inquisitive]] or a [[Sentinel Marshal|Sentinel Marshals]]
with a sword in one hand and a [[wand]] in the other. But no one
calls these people “arcane dragoons.” If you fight your battles
with [[fire bolt]] or [[sacred flame]], you're known as a “wandslinger.”

!! What is a Wandslinger?

At its simplest level, a wandslinger is any individual capable
of casting a destructive cantrip. Beyond that, it's about
how you present yourself to the world. If you know the [[fire bolt]]
cantrip, you could be a wandslinger. Do you
carry an [[arcane focus|magical implement]]? If so, do you display it prominently? Do
you carry your [[wand of Fernian ash|imbued wood focus]] with pride, twirling it and
doing flame tricks? If so, you're a wandslinger. By contrast, if
you're a scholarly [[wizard]] who despises conflict and prefers
not to use an arcane focus, you're not a wandslinger, even
though you are just as capable at magical combat. As much
as anything, it's about attitude.
