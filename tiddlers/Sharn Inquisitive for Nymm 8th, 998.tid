!! Stormhold District Quarantined after "Redscale" Outbreak Wreaks Havoc

[[DURA|Dura]], [[SHARN|Sharn]]—On Wir, the [[Sharn Watch]] closed off access to the [[Stormhold]] district to keep the mysterious plague known as "redscale" from spreading to the rest of the city. Watch officers said they didn't know when they'd reopen the district, but that [[adept]]s and special agents with magical immunity to the disease were conducting limited surveys of the situation in Stormhold.

More than a thousand [[Stormhold]] residents are now confined behind the barriers that the City Watch has erected at all known access points to the district. Magical observation of Stormhold this morning revealed mostly deserted streets and evidence of sporadic looting.

The redscale plague causes victims to develop scaly growths on their faces and hands, and to engage in violent, unpredictable behavior. Before the closure, the Watch attributed seventeen homicides and more than a hundred arrests to the disease.

Sages of House [[Jorasco]] are studying redscale victims in an effort to explain the virulence of the plague. "In the last two weeks, we've made some progress. Traditional anti-disease magic is effective at least some of the time, and we're researching some specific spells that should be completely effective," said Kustobel d'Jorasco. "But since we aren't yet sure how the plague is spread, we have to be very careful when studying the victims."

D'Jorasco further stated that the plague is definitely magical in origin, and that it resists common healing spells. Furthermore, she indicated that the sages had found some evidence that the disease places a magical compulsion on its victims. "One of the most puzzling aspects of redscale is how the victims behave," she said. "They seem to experience violent urges that cause them to attack others—even their friends and families. Curiously, however, redscale victims never attack each other; the victims of their violent acts are always uninfected people. Thus, if you're infected but haven't developed the scales yet, the other plague victims won't attack you."

!! 'Dragonslayer' Sniper Claims Sixth Victim

[[CENTRAL|Central Plateau]], [[SHARN|Sharn]]—The mysterious crossbow sniper known to the [[Sharn Watch]] as the “Dragonslayer” shot and killed a high-ranking member of House [[Kundarak]] on Far night, then posted handbills taunting the inability of the authorities to stop the sniper attacks.

The attack, made at dusk as the victim left a restaurant on Bruneau Street in [[Korranath]], bore the hallmarks of previous attacks: a single magic crossbow bolt shot from a great distance and a corona of fire around the victim that scorches the ground, leaving a black outline around the corpse.

The name of the victim, an elderly male [[dwarf]], was unavailable at press time.

Watch Commander [[Belew Yorgan]] expressed confidence that the Dragonslayer would soon be brought to justice, either by the city watch or by House [[Deneith]]’s [[Sentinel Marshals]].

“It’s easy to get caught up in the sensational details of these crimes and miss the important point: That this guy is a cold-blooded murderer too cowardly to face his victims,” he said. “We have a number of promising leads, and I think the next handbill you read will be the one announcing his execution date.”

The Dragonslayer has been touting his prowess with handbills and pamphlets that appear after each murder. Last night was no exception; handbills scattered across the [[Tradefair]] district criticized House [[Kundarak]] lending practices and taunted authorities.

“I am around every corner and atop every roof,” said one handbill acquired by the [[Sharn Inquisitive]]. “Neither the jackboot stooges of [[Sharn]]’s corpulent [[councilors|Sharn Council]] nor the brutes-for-coin in the pay of the incestuous [[dragontainted house|dragonmarked house]]s will ever catch me.”

Harrina Thandalask, a sergeant in the watch’s [[Blackened Book]] division, said that the handbills are being posted along crowded thoroughfares by someone using an [[unseen servant]] spell. Such magic makes it difficult to apprehend whomever’s distributing the handbills, she said.

“People don’t notice the handbills going up right away, and when someone gets curious, the so-called Dragonslayer or a confederate just drops the spell and slips away,” she said.

The Dragonslayer’s victims have been spread across the city. They include:

* Ilya d’[[Cannith]], killed Nymm 2 in [[Ashblack]].
* Endari d’[[Tharashk]], killed Dravago 20 in the [[Clifftop]] district.
* Lasca d’[[Ghallanda]], killed Dravago 17 in the [[North Market]] district.
* Chenni d’[[Jorasco]], killed Dravago 11 in [[Seventh Tower]].
* Torlak d’[[Sivis]], killed Dravago 4 in the [[Callestan]] district. While the crime scene bore many similarities to subsequent Dragonslayer attacks, no handbills have ever appeared claiming responsibility for the attack.

!! Rivals ir’Tannak and ir’Lann Join Forces for Attainder Bill

[[WROAT|Wroat]]—An unlikely alliance between bitter political foes Kurlo ir’Tannak and Hansa ir’Lann means that the [[Silver Lake]] Attainder Decree is likely to pass [[Parliament|Breland Parliament]] by month’s end.

“Never let it be said that the Tannak family will put personality before what’s good for [[Breland]],” ir’Tannak said. “The merits of this decree are beyond question, and I’ll be proud to cast my vote for it.

“Let the past stay where it is,” said ir’Lann in a rare speech before Parliament. “Bury the past with all the honor that you bury the bravest soldier, but then march onward and carry the day for [[Breland]].”

While their speeches on Wir sounded common themes, the pair have oratorical styles as opposite as their previous positions. Kurlo ir’Tannak’s speech alternated between fiery rhetoric against “enemies of Breland, foreign and domestic” and folksy appeals for support from his “lords and brothers.” Hansa ir’Lann’s quavering voice could barely be heard in the upper galleries—a reason why most of his legislative work is done behind the scenes.

If ir’Tannak and ir’Lann both vote in favor of the attainder decree, it will mark the first time they’ve ever cast their votes together, excepting strictly ceremonial decrees. As recently as last year, ir’Tannak accused ir’Lann of treason and ir’Lann called ir’Tannak “an unrepentant drunkard” in the wake of the controversial High Seas Accords.

Their rivalry predates their postwar service in Parliament. It’s widely believed that ir’Tannak and ir’Lann engaged in fisticuffs in the middle of the Battle of Red Creek in 979, when both were colonels under legendary General Bollandar, separately sent to seize a key bridge. Records of the incident remain sealed, and given the folkloric quality of the tale, its veracity remains unknown.

If passed by [[Parliament|Breland Parliament]] and signed by King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]], the attainder decree would mandate the forfeiture of property belonging to 14 family estates along the southern shore of [[Silver Lake]]. Those families, citing [[Thrane]] advances along the northern front, refused to send manor guards to break a [[Droaam]]ite siege of a [[Six Kings]] outpost in 988.

Ownership of the estates would pass to the crown.
