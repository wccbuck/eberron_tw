Several Qiku villages, while designed\nto be movable on short notice, have persisted for decades\nnow and are essentially permanent. Most of these villages\nare built in, on top of, and around the sprawling boulder\nmounds of the central [[Tundra|Tashana Tundra]], and feature tents, tunnels and semipermanent structures of earth and stone.\nThe Qiku currently share much of the far southern\nlands and resources with the refugee [[Doriak]] [[dwarves|dwarf]] of\nthe [[Paqaa Mountains]]. \n\nPrevious to the rise of the [[Inspired]] in [[Riedra]],\na branch of the Qiku nation roamed far south into\nthe lands that are now the [[Dor Maleer]] region. As the\nInspired came to power, they enslaved these southern\ntribes, who have since evolved into an elite warrior caste\nserving in Riedra's [[Savage Legion|Taskaan Legion]]. \n\nSee also [[Culture of the Tashana shifters]].\n\nThe Qiku Sky Teller for the Summit Council is [[Naar-Esqa]].",
