        "text": "The [[upper ward]]s of [[Sharn]] use a network of chutes to\nfunnel garbage down into the sewers. Refuse and filth is\nchanneled into cavernous midden chambers, where it is\nleft to rot or be devoured by the vermin and [[ooze]]s that\ninhabit the sewers. Smaller tunnels channel wastewater\ninto purification centers, where [[magewright]]s use magic\nto cleanse the water. A special unit of the [[Sharn Watch]]\nprotects the purification chambers. Beyond these small,\nvital areas, the sewers are lawless.\n\nThough the sewers were never intended to support a\npopulation, over the centuries a subculture has evolved\nin this region. A few tribes of people—mostly [[goblin]]s,\nalong with a few [[shifter]]s, [[dwarves|dwarf]], and feral [[halfling]]s—live in the sewers, rummaging through the midden\nheaps and selling their goods in the lower city. These\nsewer clans constantly battle over territory, as control\nof one or more midden chamber can be critical to survival. The sewer clans can pose a threat to adventurers,\nbut they can also be valuable allies; there are no better\nguides to the sewers and what lies beneath them than\none of the folk who live there. ",
