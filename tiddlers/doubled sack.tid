title: doubled sack
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This sack resembles any other sack, and can hold 1 cubic foot of material weighing up to 30 lbs. However, it can also be turned inside out, which does not empty its contents and instead allows it to be filled again with another 1 cubic foot of material weighing up to 30 lbs. If the bag is cut or torn the contents of both 'sides' spill out onto the ground. Feeling the bag or searching it only reveals the contents for the 'side' the bag is currently on, making this an effective smuggler's tool. However, if the searcher turns the bag inside out, the other contents will again become detectable.
