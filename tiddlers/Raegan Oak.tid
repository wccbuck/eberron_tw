A [[wildhunt]] [[shifter]] from the [[Towering Wood]], Raegan is the [[druid]]ic advisor for [[Sylbaran]]. He represents the [[Wardens of the Wood]] and the Great Druid [[Oalian]], and is charged to provide the town council and the people of Sylbaran with guidance on how best to live in harmony with the world around them. Raegan is old and has some gray in his fur, but he is filled with a love of life and exudes an infectious energy. Raegan performs Warden ceremonies in the [[Haven|Haven (Sylbaran campsite)]] meadows, and teaches aspirants seeking to grasp the primal mysteries. Oak has a strong bond with [[Dew-on-the-Leaf]], and often sleeps in their branches.
