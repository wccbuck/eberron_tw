Grungs are aggressive frog-like [[gnome]]-sized [[humanoid]]s found in rainforests and jungles, where they fiercely defend their territories. Grungs come in a variety of dazzlingly bright colors, which serve as a warning to all potential predators: their skin is filled with deadly toxins. Grungs can also breathe in both air and water, and some are able to manifest [[primal magic]], casting spells such as [[barkskin]] and [[spike growth]].
