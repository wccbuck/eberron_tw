Dhakaani (or "High Goblin", or "Volaarun") was the [[language]] of the Empire of [[Dhakaan]] of [[Khorvaire]], and a version of it is still spoken today by the [[Heirs of Dhakaan]]. The most widely-spoken descendant of Dhakaani is the language commonly called "[[Goblin]]" spoken throughout [[Khorvaire]]. But unique pieces of old Dhakaani can still be heard today in the [[Azhani]], [[Gnoll]], [[Talentan]], and [[Vvaraa'shul]] languages, all of which use its script.
