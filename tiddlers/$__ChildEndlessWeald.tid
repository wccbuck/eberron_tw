''Prerequisite:'' Know the [[speak with animals]] spell

As a child, I went walking in the old woods
and strayed from the path, wandering into
the [[Endless Weald]] of [[Thelanis]]. I might have
been lost forever if the [[Forest Queen]] hadnâ€™t
found me and raised me as her own. I grew
up surrounded by wonders, but in time, I
yearned to see the land of my birth. The
Queen opened a path for me, but warned
me never to slay a [[beast]].

//How long was I in [[Thelanis]], and how much time passed on [[Eberron]] in my absence? What do I long to see in the Material Plane?//

''GM Notes: ''Any [[spell]]s the character knows could be presented as [[fey]] magic. The
character can fight [[beast]]s without trouble,
but if they ever land a killing blow, they lose their ability to cast [[speak with animals]] and have [[disadvantage]] on attempts to sway beasts until they find a way to atone.
