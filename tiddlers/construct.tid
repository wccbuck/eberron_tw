Constructs are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others (namely, [[warforged]]) are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. [[Golems|golem]] are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the plane of [[Daanvi]], such as [[modron]]s, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane as embodiments of pure law.
