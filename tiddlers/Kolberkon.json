        "text": "Prince [[Kolberkon]] is the leader of the [[Diresharks]] and governor of [[Port Verge]]. He has ambitions to unseat his rival [[Ryger ir'Wynarn]] become the next High Prince of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. His hope of leading the Principalities rests on his ability to outshine High Prince Ryger in every way, and Port Verge is his starting point: He hopes to develop the city to outshine [[Regalport]], the seat of the [[Seadragons]].\n\nKolberkon's alliance with House [[Lyrandar]] for financing his grand schemes is well known, but he has also privately struck deals with the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]]. He is well aware that these alliances carry risks, but Kolberkon is wily and cautious, and is ready for an attack from any of a dozen foes at all times. Unknown to most, he has employed several talented [[changeling]]s who he uses as decoys, sometimes posing as the Prince even at parleys and banquets.",
