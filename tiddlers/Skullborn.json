Conceit,\nan overblown sense of entitlement, or grief over\nthe loss of a loved one has led a few young [[elves|elf]] to\ndemand access to the Transition ritual. The nobility\nignores these pleas, forcing the Skullborn, as they call\nthemselves, to seek other paths. That search led them\nto form an uneasy alliance with the [[Emerald Claw]]. To\nthe Skullborn, becoming a [[vampire]] or a [[lich]] in the\nnear future is an acceptable alternative to waiting for,\nor being denied, the Transition.\n\nThe Skullborn is a loose organization with few tenets.\nIts members believe that the [[Undying Court]] is guilty\nof allowing [[elves|elf]] to die needlessly and that the Transition should be performed on any elf who desires it.\nMany of the groupâ€™s members dabble in [[necromantic|necromancy]]\nrituals, and some have magical powers.\n\nThe Skullborn's headquarters is the [[Hall of the Bereaved]] in [[Pylas Talaear]].",
