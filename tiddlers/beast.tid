Beasts are non-[[humanoid]] creatures that are a natural part of [[Eberron]]'s ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals (including insects), giant versions of animals such as [[dire beast]]s, and [[dinosaur]]s.
