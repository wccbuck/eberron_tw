//What looked at first like a mound of corpses and discarded armament now shifts and moves. Eight legs and two massive claws emerge. Four eyes on stalks snake out from above the claws.//

The carcass crab is a warped mutation of natural life found
in the [[Mournland]], and occasionally in [[Valenar]] and [[Darguun]]. Though essentially a giant crustacean, it augments
its natural armor by attaching the detritus of battle—bits
of armor, weapons, and bodies—to its hard shell with a
natural adhesive. This trait provides both protection and
camouflage in the wasted battlefields of the [[Mournland]],
the creature’s preferred hunting ground.

Carcass crabs are hardly brilliant or subtle opponents.
They make minimal use of their camouflage to get close to
potential prey, then try to grab one opponent and scurry
off to make a meal of it. They can also hurl poisonous barbs
at targets out of claw’s reach.
