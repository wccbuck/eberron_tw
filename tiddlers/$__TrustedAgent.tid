''Prerequisite:'' non-[[gnome]], know the [[Zilasalza]] language

I was born a [[gnome]] of [[Zilargo]]. I volunteered for an experimental program of the
[[Trust]]—they mystically transformed me into my current form so I could serve as a deep-cover agent in the world beyond Zilargo. I want to protect my homeland and its people, and I’m always looking for information that could be important. Sometimes I receive telepathic directives from my superior, who I
only know as “Book.”

//What was my Zil name? Do I miss [[Zilargo]]? How long have I played this role?//

''GM Notes: ''Work with the player to develop details about their life in [[Zilargo]]. Did they have family? A lover? As they adventure, might they encounter [[gnome]]s that they knew in that life? How will they respond? After all, the agent isn’t supposed to have any contact with anyone from their old life!
