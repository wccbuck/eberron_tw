title: bronzewood
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This exceptionally hard wood, which only grows in [[Aerenal]] and in a
few groves hidden deep in the [[Towering Wood]], is useful in the manufacture of armor and
weapons. Unlike most woods, bronzewood can be used
instead of metal to fashion heavy armor and weaponsâ€”it
is somewhat shapeable during manufacturing, and it keeps
a sharp edge. Although dense and weighty compared to
other woods, it is still lighter than steel.

//Leafweave// armor is made from alchemically treated leaves of the bronzewood
tree, and can offer the same level of protection as studded
leather or a chain shirt.
