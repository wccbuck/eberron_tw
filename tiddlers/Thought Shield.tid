Your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it (though extremely powerful telepathic entities might be able to break through). You also have resistance to [[psychic damage|damage type]]. When you are actively defending against a psychic assault, you may be able to reflect the psychic damage you resisted back on the attacker.
