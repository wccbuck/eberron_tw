Shadukar is a graveyard of blackened rubble and burned trees, its people restless spirits sifting through the ashes of the past. Its ruins are a grim reminder of the cost of the [[Last War]]. Once known as the Jewel of the [[Sound|Scions Sound]], this coastal
city was destroyed in 961 by [[Karrnath]]i forces led by general Breyse Horacht. The city has yet to be reclaimed, and it's said to be haunted both by [[Thrane]] [[ghost]]s and by [[undead]] forces left behind by the Karrns.
