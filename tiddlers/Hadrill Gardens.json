Access to the more dangerous plants is restricted to students in the botany department who have permission from a faculty member. There are nine greenhouses (including one devoted exclusively to orchids from [[Xen'drik]] and [[Q'barra]]) and a large open-air garden that is a popular site for romantic walks and meditation among both students and staff.\n\nThe master of the Hadrill Gardens is Professor [[Kona Erran]].",
