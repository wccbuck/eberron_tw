''District Type: ''Adventurer's quarter<br/>

''First Impression:'' The towers of this district are
drab gray granite, but the crowds that fill the streets
are quite colorful. People of all races and cultures
can be seen. An [[Aundair]]ian wizard compares notes
with a [[kalashtar]] monk in the shade of a tavern, while
across the street a [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] privateer and a [[Valenar]] [[elf]]
compare blades. Clifftop is a fairly dingy districtâ€”but
it attracts an interesting crowd.<br/>
''Social Class:'' Lower class<br/>
''Neighbors:'' [[Highwater]] (southwest); [[Hope's Peak]] (south); [[Tumbledown]] (below)

This district attracts those willing to devote sword,
spells, or skills to risky but profitable endeavors. Anyone looking for a discreet bodyguard, a mercenary soldier, or a guide to the wilds of [[Xen'drik]] can
find what they need in Clifftop. Adventurers looking for a patron may find one here.

Clifftop is a curious blend of wealth and poverty.
Most of the businesses in the district are serviceable,
but not exceptional, providing for the needs of the
adventurer who rarely has more than a few pieces of
gold in his purse. It also provides services for the lucky
explorer or privateer who has returned home with
gold to spare, with commercial spellcasters, shops
selling used wands and old mageworked weapons, and
other exotic goods readily available. While similar in
many ways to the [[Deathsgate]] district, Clifftop has a
better and generally well-deserved reputation.

The district provides a number of services
adventurers may find useful. A wide variety of hirelings can be found here, and all of them are used
to putting up with the odd demands of adventurers. Likewise, as adventurers have a way of getting
into trouble with the law, there are a considerable
number of barristers and advocates in the district.
The pawnshops of Clifftop offer 45% of value for
almost any sorts of goods, except those that are obviously stolen; fences that deal in stolen goods must be
found in the [[lower levels|Lower Dura]] of [[Dura]].
