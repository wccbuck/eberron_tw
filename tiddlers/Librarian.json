He interviews each [[shade]] as it passes through the Realm of the Dead and makes a record of its life. His power is such that an entire life can be confined to a single large page.\n\nThe Librarian himself is a massive hooded figure, and his books are likewise enormous. It's said that he can be many places at once, allowing him to speak to every shade, capturing the story of its life, before it fades.",
