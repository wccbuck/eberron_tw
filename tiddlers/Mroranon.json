Lead the way, but lead wisely.\n\nClan Mroranon has always been the largest and strongest\nof the ruling [[clans|Mror clan]]. The mythical Mroranon is said to have\nbeen the son of the last king of the [[Realm Below]], and to have\nrallied the exiles to establish the [[Mror Holds]]. Talespinners say\nthat it was [[Kol Korran]]'s bargain with Mroranon that ensured\nprosperity for the dwarves, and [[Krona Peak]] is home to both\nthe [[Iron Council]] and [[Kol Korran's Throne]], the largest temple\ndedicated to the [[Sovereign|Sovereign Host]] in [[Khorvaire]].\n\nWhile Mroranonhold has a wide variety of mines, it's best\nknown for iron and [[mithral]]. It has established strong ties with\nHouse [[Cannith]], though all of the [[Five Nations]] import Mroranon\nsteel. It has the strongest general industrial base of the holds,\nand [[Krona Peak]] is the largest single city in the region.\n\nMroranon [[dwarves|dwarf]] are proud of their skills as warriors and\nnegotiators, even if they acknowledge [[Doldarun]] and [[Kolkarun]]\nto be the best in those fields. What sets the Mroranon apart is\nleadership. Mroranon sees the future and inspires others to\nfollow. Mroranon unites, and makes wise decisions for the good\nof all. This ties to the mythic story of Mroranon as the leaderâ€”[[Doldarun]] is a mighty champion, but Mroranon has the vision. Mroranon are strong supporters of the [[Sovereign Host]] and believe that the dwarves are blessed; many of the most devout\nMror priests and powerful [[adept]]s hail from Mroranonhold.\n\nWith the largest and most industrialized territory, Mroranon\nhas the deepest investment in the [[Realm Below]]. It has multiple\ncolony outposts, including one tied to a [[demiplane]] mine and\nanother holding an ancient fortress, and is holding a firm line\nwhile building power for another surge. Mroranon and its vassal\nclans have recovered many legendary relics and artifacts from\nthe depths. While they don't oppose [[symbiont]]s as strongly as\n[[Doldarun]], they refuse to make use of //dularash// (Mror word meaning \"foul blood\") items and assert that any contact with the [[daelkyr]] or their creations is dangerous.\n\nAcolyte, noble, and soldier are common backgrounds for\nMroranon dwarves. While [[paladin]]s are more likely to be found\nin [[Doldarun]], [[cleric]]s, fighters, and [[bard]]s are all sound choices for Mroranon. With its big cities, it's also a reasonable option for criminals and rogues.",
