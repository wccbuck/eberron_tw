It is the central meeting place and social spot for the community, and its common room serves as an indoor market and town hall.\n\nRhysimor and Hana have rebuilt and floored the\nstation’s rafters to serve as a barracks-style room with\nfourteen beds total. The inn has three private rooms\nto let—refurbished storerooms on the ground floor.\nRhysimor and Hana keep their own quarters beneath\nthe station building in a series of converted cellar\nrooms with multiple emergency exits to the outside.\nThe community’s precious water well is located in a\nwalled courtyard at the rear entrance of the inn.",
