 A [[mind flayer]] named Chyrassk has emerged from [[Khyber]] and taken up residence in the abandoned [[Citadel of the Closed Circle]] deep below [[Sharn]]. Chyrassk brought a small force from Khyber—[[dolgaunt]]s, [[dolgrim]]s, and an [[umber hulk]]—but he has begun to build up a [[human]] following, especially among the refugees of [[Cyre]]. He has found many disturbing and powerful relics in this fortress.
