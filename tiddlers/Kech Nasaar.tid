! Keepers of Night

Long ago, interaction with the [[Aereni line|Aereni noble line]] of [[Vol]] led to the [[dirge singer]] [[Iraala]] becoming the first dar [[vampire]]. She shared this
gift with her lover, the warlord [[Muurat]]. In the centuries that
passed, the two were placed in charge of the covert operations
of the empire. Spying and assassination remained the domain
of the [[Khesh'dar]], but the Kech Nasaar served both as internal
security and as commandos specializing in guerilla tactics
and psychological warfare. It was the Kech Nasaar who first
recognized the threat of the [[Kapaa'vola]], and set the Keeper seclusion in motion.

Over their long seclusion, the Kech Nasaar have continued to study unconventional paths of warfare. Nasaar [[dirge singer]]s often train in the techniques of the [[bard]]ic <<navAndScrollToHeader bard "College of Whispers">>, while elite soldiers of the Kech Nasaar might be [[gloom stalker]]s. Under the leadership of [[Iraala]] and [[Muurat]], the Nasaar have also explored the arts of [[necromancy]], though it's up to the GM to decide
just how far they've continued down this path. Do they have
squads of [[vampire]] commandos? Have they developed entirely
new forms of [[undead]]? Given their penchant for psychological
warfare, Nasaar agents could sow terror and confusion by
raising the bones of soldiers who died in the [[Last War]], making
it seem like the vengeful dead yearned to continue the battle. Or
perhaps the Nasaar have developed techniques allowing them
to seize control of undead raised by other necromancersâ€”a
technique that could cause untold chaos in [[Karrnath]].

Iraala and Muurat continue to lead the clan, giving a direct
tie to the ancient empire. The edict of a long-dead emperor
asserted that no dead creature could wear the imperial crown;
while the services of the Nasaar were valued, the dead are
severed from the [[Uul Dhakaan]] and cannot draw on the wisdom
of the past or see [[Jhazaal|Jhazaal Dhakaan]]'s dream. The Nasaar could have
fallen into true darkness in their isolation, and now seek to
seize power for themselves. On the other hand, despite being
cut off from the Uul Dhakaan, Iraala and Muurat remember
the actual glory of the fallen empire, and could be the truest
devotees of the concepts of [[muut and atcha]], placing the needs
of the empire above their personal ambitions. As in ancient
times, they might seek to guide the living emperor, and to
ensure the [[Dhakaan]]i Empire follows the proper course.

A player character from the Kech Nasaar could follow
unusual paths. A Nasaar dar might be gathering information
for the clan, or they could be tasked to monitor the activities
of the other Keepers, especially the [[Kech Ghaalrac]] and [[Kech Shaarat]]. [[Iraala]] may have hidden artifacts across [[Khorvaire]] before the fall; a Nasaar character could seek to recover these in her service, or could have gone rogue to pursue one of these treasures.
