The [[druid]]s say that children of Vult are practical, careful folk who generally plan ahead and prepare for the worst; when disaster strikes, the children of Vult hold civilization together. In his study of the [[Seren]]s, the sage Galeoin reported that the barbarians believe that Vult \"devours\" the spirits of deceased [[greatwyrm]]s that fail to attain godhood.",
