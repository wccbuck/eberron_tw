        "text": "The Greenhaunt (also known as the \"Whistling Woods\") is a forest in northern [[Breland]], near the [[Blackcap Mountains]]. During the Empire of [[Dhakaan]], the Greenhaunt was part of a great forest that stretched from the [[Blackcap Mountains]] to [[Scions Sound]]. Over time, the forest was cleared by settlers, leaving only a few regions drenched in [[primal power|primal magic]] where mortals feared to tread. The Greenhaunt is one of these regions, and it is populated by a community of [[firbolg]]s, the self-professed children of the [[Forest Queen]].\n\nThe [[druid]]s of the Greenhaunt were the first to create [[goodberry]] wine, a strong drink that can accelerate healing.\n\nThe Whistling Woods are also known for being the hideout of the infamous Bandit King [[Horas Calt]] in the 870s YK.",
