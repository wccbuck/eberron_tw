        "text": "Hareth ir'Talan constructed\nSharn's first aerial arena, and over the centuries this\nodd structure has brought a great deal of silver into\nthe district. While most windchases occur outside\nthe towers, [[skyblade]] matches and many other aerial\nsports are played in an enclosed space. The Hollow\nTower provides that spaceâ€”multiple levels of one of\nthe great towers converted into an enormous domed\narena, lined with [[everbright lantern]]s to provide illumination at all hours. Today, many of the more prestigious events take place at [[Cornerstone]] in [[Middle Tavick's Landing]], but the Hollow Tower still does a\nbrisk business, and many of the other districts use\nthe tower as a training ground.
