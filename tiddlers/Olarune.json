The [[druid]]s say that those born when Olarune is ascendant have a strong bond to community and to order, and a natural desire to protect others; superstition holds that more paladins are born in this month than any other. Scattered [[therianthrope]]s, especially weretigers, revere Olarune as a sort of demigoddess-protector.",
