The [[druid]]s say that those born when Olarune is ascendant have a strong bond to community and to order, and a natural desire to protect others; superstition holds that more [[paladin]]s are born in this month than any other. Scattered [[therianthrope]]s, especially weretigers, revere Olarune as a sort of demigoddess-protector. \n\nThe [[Moonspeakers]], the sect of [[shifter]] [[druid]]s of the [[Towering Wood]], believe Olarune was the goddess who freed the shifters from a time of chaos and terror, and taught them how to master the beast within. The entity who overcame this curse may have been a [[dragon]], an [[archfey]], or perhaps a manifestation of the [[primal magic]] of [[Eberron]] itself.",
