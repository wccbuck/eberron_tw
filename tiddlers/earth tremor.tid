type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You cause a tremor in the ground within 10 feet. Each creature other than you in that area must keep their balance or else fall prone and/or suffer bludgeoning damage. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult to traverse until the rubble is cleared.
