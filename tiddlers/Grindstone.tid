Grindstone is the heart of the [[Karrnath]]i influence over the district of [[Southwatch]]. Festivals and holidays from the homeland are celebrated here with exuberance, and the ward’s Karrnathi residents regard themselves as separate from the city’s other citizens. The [[militia]] known as the [[Swords of Karrn]] enforces order, and between Karrnathi pride and what amounts to martial law, Grindstone is essentially a city within the city of [[Stormreach]].
