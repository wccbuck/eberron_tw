While on a [[plane]] with this property, time is fluid, inconsistent both with the Material Plane and within its own [[layer]]s. Adventurers who spend a day in this plane could find that a year has passed in [[Eberron]], or they could be trapped in this plane for a year and find that only an hour has passed when they return.
