The daughter of the [[Lord Commander|Iyan ir'Talan]], Iyanna is idealistic and honorable. She fights for the\ngood of the common people. If the adventurers need\nan honest ally in the Watch, Iyanna is perhaps their\nbest hope. Despite her father's best efforts to keep her\nfrom getting entangled in the criminal underworld,\nher actions have won her no friends among [[Sharn]]'s\ncrime lords, and her life could be in danger despite\nher parentage.
