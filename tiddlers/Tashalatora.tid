''Population:'' <<ntls>>

One of three temple-fortresses that guards passage into [[Adar]] directly from [[Riedra]], Tashalatora is home to [[monk]]s renowned even in [[Khorvaire]]. A few
Khorvairians even seek this monastery as a place to perfect their training. Tashalatora's fighters are among the most powerful in Adar, blending [[psionic|psionics]] or [[magical|arcane magic]] skill with fighting prowess in unorthodox ways.

Tashalatora breeds strong fighters because many
within the fortress and in [[Adar]] fear the [[Riedrans]] will one
day cross into the land of refuge by way of [[Vulpana Falls]],
which the citadel overlooks. For the hundreds of miles
between Tashalatora and the [[Haztaratain Monastery]] no other land is passable. Still, an army would have to pass
through or around the [[Shanjueed Jungle]] and its [[Mabar]]
[[manifest zone]], climb all the way up the hills and mountains to the falls, and then cross the falls. Furthermore,
the [[Inspired]] have few significant settlements nearby to
support such an undertaking. As a result, the Riedrans
have yet to try the passage.

Those seeking an audience with Venerable [[Thatari]] must establish a relationship of trust with the elders of Tashalatora before they will reveal the location of her remote mountain cave.
