This\nturned out to be a backhanded compliment; traitors\nwere buried alongside heroes, and the crypt was built\ntoo close to the water.\n\nLack of upkeep and regular water damage make the crypt an unpleasant place to visit, and it has been raided by [[Emerald Claw]] [[necromancers|necromancy]] in need\nof [[undead]] muscle. Guards today try to save enough\nmoney to be buried elsewhere, so the crypt has become\nthe pauperâ€™s option.",
