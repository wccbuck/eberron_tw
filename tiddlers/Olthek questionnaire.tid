title: Olthek questionnaire
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This is the [[Mission: Graywall]] [[questionnaire]] for [[Olthek]].

! Olthek, Gnoll Huntmaster

[[Droaam]], land of monsters, has been an untamed frontier for centuries. But twelve years ago, the trio of [[hag]]s known as the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] forged it into a nation. The [[warlord]]s who dominate different regions of Droaam owe fealty to the Daughters, and provide the hags with tribute—either material goods, or the services of troops, laborers, and otherwise skilled individuals. [[Olthek]] is one such individual.

Olthek is a //''gnoll huntmaster''//. Armed with a shortbow and a sharp wit, Olthek is a skilled warrior and strategist, experienced with leading packs of [[gnoll]]s on successful hunts and combat operations. He is a member of the [[Znir Pact]], a community of gnolls in [[Droaam]] that has no [[warlord]] of its own and casts aside the [[demon]]-worshipping ways of their people's past. Znir Pact gnolls offer their services to all of the power groups of Droaam in exchange for fair pay; in this way, they maintain their neutrality and independence, and have never been dominated by any warlord. Olthek has //''little patience for fools''//, becoming irritable and overbearing when dealing with people beneath his intellect. He is also a //''connoisseur of fine meats''//, a knowledgeable gourmet of high-quality victuals as well as preparation and cooking techniques. He is disgusted by [[grist]], the mysterious sour-tasting ground meat that the [[Daughters|Daughters of Sora Kell]] have made freely available as a staple food for the citizens of [[Droaam]].

!! Character Questions

For each of the below questions, please choose one of the two options.

<ol>
<li>

Who is your [[warlord]]?

<table><tr>
<td width="50%">
You are part of the elite guard of Sheshka, the [[Queen of Stone]]. You serve the hereditary queen of the [[medusa]]s of [[Cazhaak Draal]] as a paid mercenary, like the other [[gnoll]]s of your contingent. However, you have seen the true concern Sheshka shows for her people, the cunning strategies she employs to keep them safe and happy, the wisdom and charisma of a true ruler. You feel more than obliged to serve her; you are devoted. Write "''Do not speak ill of the Queen of Stone''" as one of your "bond" [[aspect]]s.
</td><td>
You actually do not serve a specific [[warlord]]; you were sent to serve the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] directly from [[Stonejaw Keep]]. This dismal fortress is a hub for negotiations between the [[Znir Pact]] brotherhoods and the rest of [[Droaam]].  The leaders of the clans form a council that discuss matters and make decisions by majority vote. You take pride in the independence of your people, and value the principles of neutrality and democracy. Write "''Mercenary of Stonejaw Keep''" as one of your "bond" [[aspect]]s.
</td></tr></table>

</li>
<li>

Where do you see yourself in three years?

<table><tr>
<td width="50%">
You see the next few years as a golden opportunity to climb the ladder of social and political influence. Your ambition drives you to expand your network of contacts through charm, exchange of favors, and perhaps a bit of old-fashioned intimidation. In three years, you see yourself in a position of power, perhaps as a councilor for your [[Znir Pact]] brotherhood, or an honor guard advisor who reports directly to the [[Queen of Stone]]… or perhaps you’re aiming even higher, striving to become a [[warlord]] and carve out a piece of [[Droaam]] for yourself? Write "''Aspirations for higher office''" as your "ideal" [[aspect]].
</td><td>
The thrill of the hunt for you goes beyond mere excitement; it is your calling. Over the next few years, you intend to seek out more and more dangerous game, collecting mementos from each beast and adding them to your trophy collection. You see yourself hunting down mutated monstrosities in the jungles of [[Xen'drik]], or even bringing down vicious roaming [[fiend]]s in the [[Demon Wastes]]. In three years' time, you want your name to be known far and wide as one of the greatest huntmasters in history. Write "''Thrillseeking trophy hunter''" as your "ideal" [[aspect]].
</td></tr></table>

<li>

Which of these two [[talent]]s do you prefer? Add your choice to the Talents section of your character sheet.

<table><tr>
<td width="50%">
[[Quick Formation]]. Your experience leading packs of gnolls allows you to make quick formation decisions when commanding your allies. Gain an [[advantage]] when using [[boost]] to coordinate combat formations.
</td><td>
[[Ranger]]. Trained by [[Znir|Znir Pact]] shamans, you have learned how to steal power from the [[Wild Heart]], drawing on it without giving anything in return. Spells added: [[hunter's mark]], [[longstrider]].
