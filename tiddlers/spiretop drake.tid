This small reptile resembles a [[pseudodragon]], though it has no stinger.
Its scales are iridescent white, like a pearl, and its tail is as long as its
snakelike body. Its wings are long and wide, but they fold close to its
body when it is not in flight.

These dragonets are known for their habit of following ships in order to feed on the fish disturbed by the vessel’s passing, much like sea gulls. Sailors
sometimes call them crow’s nest dragons, since they
tend to swoop around the crow’s nest of a ship and
sometimes perch on it. In [[Sharn]], they build their
nests on the very tops of the city’s towers, giving
them their local name. They are sometimes encountered
as companions or [[familiar]]s.

A spiretop drake is about 18 inches long, with
an additional 18 inches of tail. Its wingspan is about
3 feet, and it weighs about 2 pounds.
