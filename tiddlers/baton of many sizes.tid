This segmented, 1-foot-long rod is similar to a [[pole of collapsing]]. While holding the rod, you can speak its command word to cause it to extend in either direction. The rod can extend up to 50 feet, or as far as the surrounding space allows; if the rod touches another creature or surface before reaching its full length, it stops extending in that direction. If it stops extending against a solid, unmoving surface, the rod fills the gaps to hold firm against it. It retracts when you speak the command word again.

The baton is unwieldy to hold or swing once it's longer than 10 feet. If you drop the rod or use it to make an attack while it is extended longer than 10 feet, it immediately retracts back to its shortened length.
