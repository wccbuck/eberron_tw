Talentan is the [[language]] of the [[halfling]]s of the [[Talenta Plains]]. The nomadic Talenta tribes themselves refer to this language as "Bescat", meaning "exchange", and each tribe speaks their own mutually intelligible dialect. In the [[Mror Holds]], this language is called "Bazragi", meaning "tribespeak" in [[Dethek]].

The modern Talenta language evolved from a Proto-[[Khorvairian|Khorvaire]] that is not spoken today, with infusions from [[Dethek]] and bits of old [[Dhakaani]].
