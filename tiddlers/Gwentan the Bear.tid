type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Gwentan is a [[shifter]] of the [[Eldeen Reaches]] who can freely [[wild shape]] into a bear and back again, even transforming individual parts of his body at will. He believes he is a champion of [[Olarune]], who legends say granted the wisest shifter warriors dominion over the natural world and the gift of shapeshifting long ago. He is not bound to any particular [[druid]] sect, but claims to wield a divine purpose to purge the curse that corrupted Olarune's gift into [[therianthropy|therianthrope]].
