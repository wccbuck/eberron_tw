The toad-like slaadi are native immortals of [[Kythri]]. Though they do
reproduce (in strange and disturbing ways) and can die of mortal
ailments, they're defined as [[immortal]]s because their population remains constant. 

Slaadi reproduce either by implanting [[humanoid]] hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a transformative [[disease]] called chaos phage. Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a different way, with red slaadi spawning blue and green slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories. Some slaadi can shapeshift into the humanoid creatures from which they were originally spawned.

Whenever a new slaad is born—whatever the method of its creation—an existing slaad dies, seemingly at random. And whenever a slaad is killed, a new one is formed.
So while they seem to share many of the traits of mortals, they
can never be wiped out even if they die en masse, and even if a
blue slaad transforms a village of humans into slaadi with the
chaos phage, the overall number of slaadi doesn't increase.

The slaadi are the only native civilization of [[Kythri]]. They
aren't a monolithic society; some live in massive cities, while
others are tiny rustic communities. Each slaad community
has its own distinct culture and a grand name, and a few examples of these can be found below—but there are many more, and they're constantly changing. The grand city
of [[Cornerstone|Cornerstone (Kythri city)]] may be the seat of the brutal Concordance of Iron today, and the Enlightened Lyceum League a month later.
These changes are astonishingly fast, but they aren't instant;
there are usually at least a few days of chaotic transition and
revolution in between a change. The scope of a community
won't change—Cornerstone is always a metropolis, while Turn is always a village—but the structures of the community shift. Under the Concordance of Iron, Cornerstone is filled with brutalist iron towers, while the Cornerstone of the Lyceum
League is filled with slender glass spires.

* ''The Grand Concordance of Iron'' is a ruthless regime that intends to subjugate all slaadi, and then, the entire multiverse. It's a strict caste system in which the death slaadi are cruel tyrants and all slaadi serve in the military.
* ''The Enlightened Lyceum League'' is a democratic society of scholars and philosophers. They believe in finding a peaceful solution to every problem and a logical answer to every question.
* ''The Final Regency'' asserts that the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]] have abandoned reality and ordered the slaadi of the Regency to rule the multiverse in their stead until they return. They are fanatically devoted to a slaad-based version of the Sovereign Host and are offended by all inaccurate representations.
* ''The Glorious Union of Flesh'' asserts that slaadi are the ultimate evolution of life and seek to grant all other [[humanoid]]s the gift of slaadhood through the chaos phage. They don't accept the idea that slaad numbers will always remain constant; clearly previous slaad cultures just weren't doing it properly.
* ''The Confluence of Reality'' believes that every civilization has something worth emulating, and studies other cultures to find these things. In a Confluence community, you could find slaadi eating [[Aundair]]ian crepes, playing an [[Aereni|Aerenal]] form of [[Conqueror]], and debating the finer points of [[Daanvi]] law.
* ''The Republic of B'ob'' is ruled by a red slaad who makes up new laws whenever he feels like it. Why is B'ob in charge? Well, that was the first rule he made, and the only one he hasn't changed. And he's B'ob! Who else would be in charge?

The slaadi themselves retain their core forms while their
buildings and government change. Red slaadi are always red
toad-like creatures that implant eggs, but the Lyceum slaadi
might be tall and slender, while the Concordance slaadi are
squat and heavy. Kythri's influence can also cause slaadi to
change color. So slaadi follow standard methods for creating
particular colors—a blue slaad infects creatures with chaos
phage, creating red or green slaadi—but a green slaad could
go to sleep one night and wake up as a death slaad, and vice
versa. In a culture like the Concordance, that means leadership
frequently changes, because it's based on color, not personality.

Because slaad cultures change so rapidly, they rarely enact
plans beyond their own communities, though cities occasionally
clash. Some weeks they seek to exterminate the [[githzerai|gith]], and
other weeks, to ally with them. You never know what you'll get.
