In {{!!title}}, you could...

* Seek to destroy an ancient mystical weapon before it falls into the hands of villains.
* Battle savage [[giant]]s in the ruins of their ancient cities.
* Match wits with cunning [[drow]] in the depths of a primordial [[jungle|Jungles of Xen'drik]].

Any follower of the [[Sovereign Host]] knows this story
about Xen'drik. In the dawn of time, the Sovereigns
bound the fiendish [[overlord]]s and freed the world from
chaos. The mighty [[giant]]s had fought alongside the Sovereigns, and in gratitude [[Aureon]] granted them dominion over the continent of Xen'drik. Aureon taught
giants the secrets of wizardry, and they grew powerful.
The giants built towers that touched the sky and seemingly endless cities.

The mightiest among the giants was the titan [[Cul'sir]].
His power was so great that he pulled the [[thirteenth moon|Crya]] from the sky and crushed it in a fit of anger. The giants ruled many lesser races, and eventually the [[elves|elf]] rose up against them. Cul'sir unleashed plagues upon
the rebellious elves. He made assassins of elven shadows and turned them back against their owners. Still the rebels persisted. In his anger, Cul'sir prepared to
pull down the rest of the moons to hurl them at his enemies, even though he'd destroy the world in doing it. But
the giants had gone too far, and [[Aureon]] set the [[dragon]]s
of [[Argonnessen]] upon them. The dragons destroyed the
vast cities and leveled the towers. [[Cul'sir]] was slain and
his people scattered.

The [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]] and [[Six|Dark Six]] each laid a curse upon the
land. [[Aureon]] decreed that the creatures of Xen'drik
would have no knowledge of law, and [[Boldrei]] proclaimed that no city would stand. The [[Traveler]] distorted
the land so that no path followed twice. The [[Devourer]]
unleashed fire and storm. And so Xen'drik remains a
land of mystery, a realm that cannot be mapped, a place
that holds secrets that could shatter the world.

This story bears at least some truth. The [[elves|elf]] were
once slaves of the ancient [[giant]]s, and the [[dragon]]s did
eradicate the civilizations of Xen'drik. Great magic has
warped the land. The [[environments of Xen'drik|shifting zone]] are extreme and unpredictable, and travelers might find a glacial expanse in the midst of a vast desert. Tens of thousands of years have passed, yet no civilization has risen
to the heights of the fallen giants; some believe that
[[Aureon]]'s and [[Boldrei]]'s curses ensure that any city that
grows too large collapses into madness. The [[Traveler's Curse]] twists space, and explorers might follow the same
path twice only to end up in entirely different locations.

Xen'drik is a continent that defies control. Expeditions
have unearthed artifacts of immense power, as well as
fields of [[Siberys]] [[dragonshard]]s, but once
you leave a site, you might never find it again.

Giants still roam Xen'drik, but these creatures have
never regained the glory of their [[ancestors|Age of Giants]]. Tribes of
[[drow]]—said to be the shadow-assassins created by the
Emperor [[Cul'sir]]—linger in the darkness. These represent just a few of the threats in this vast land.

!! Notable Locations

Many ports dot the coast of Xen'drik. In addition to the
treasures of the giants, Xen'drik is a source of Siberys
[[dragonshard]]s and other exotic resources. Scholars and
merchants come to Xen'drik on business, smugglers seek to make extra gold, and pirates prey on everyone.
Ports come and go, falling prey to monsters or natural
disasters. But two harbors have stood the test of time.

* [[Stormreach]]
* [[Dar Qat]]

!!! Generating Random Ruins

Part of the fun of Xen'drik is the chance to discover ancient
ruins. Between exploration, research, bardic knowledge,
and [[divination]] spells, PCs might learn about dozens of
sites during their stay on the mysterious continent. All
these ruins need impressive names; click the button below for
quick use or inspiration.

!! {{!!title}}'s Influence in Khorvaire

In [[Khorvaire]], you might...

* Befriend a [[drow]] making their way in the new world.
* Stop the [[Emerald Claw]] from using a [[giant]] artifact to destroy a city.
* Aid a scholar in deciphering a book of prophecy found in the heart of Xen'drik and brought to [[Stormreach]].

The tremendous diversity of the people of Xen'drik
means that no single trait defines objects and artifacts
from this land. The primitive [[drow]] make armor comparable to studded leather using the chitin of giant scorpions. Rumors abound of more advanced drow civilizations in the layers of [[Khyber]] that lie beneath Xen'drik.
The [[elves|elf]] lived and fought in Xen'drik before the exodus
that took them to [[Aerenal]], and elven artifacts remain
scattered across the region. And the grandest treasures
include the work of the [[giant]]s—which can often be difficult to use because of their size. The [[spellbook]] of a giant
[[wizard]] might hold priceless secrets, but the bulky tome
can be quite awkward for smaller folk.
