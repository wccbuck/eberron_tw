        "text": "Followers of the [[Pyrinean Creed]] honor the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]] and are\nencouraged to shun the [[Dark Six]]. The Six embody dark forces\nthat have no place in a virtuous society. However, over the\ncourse of centuries, there have always been cults to challenge\nthis view. The Three Faces cults serve two purposes. On the\none hand, they honor particular groupings of the Sovereigns\nand Six, asserting that there are members of the Six with\nsomething valuable to offer worshipers. Beyond this, the cults\nare also secret societiesâ€”a form of fraternal order that binds\npeople together even if they aren't truly invested in the religious\naspects of the cult. For example, the [[Three Faces of War]] can\nbe found in all of the armies of the [[Five Nations]].\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}sort[title]]\">>",
