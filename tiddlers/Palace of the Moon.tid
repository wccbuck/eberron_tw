type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The grandest city in the [[Moonlit Vale]] of [[Thelanis]] is the Palace of the
Moon. Its towers are built into the trunks of four vast trees,
each one reflecting the influence of a particular season.
The Summer Tree is in full bloom, while the Winter Tree
is withered and bare. The four seasons are factions among
the [[fey]] of the [[Moon Court]], and those who dwell within the
palace live within the tree of their season. The palace is
full of endless intrigues, and envoys negotiate alliances
with the [[feyspire]]s and the [[anchor barons|archfey]]. To mortals, many
of these intrigues would seem trivial and strange, but for
the [[fey]], they determine the ruling season, which sets the
tone for the layer. At the apex of each season—perhaps a
strangely arbitrary declaration in a realm with such a casual
relationship to time—the fey of the ruling season host a
grand revel, which draws [[archfey]] from all throughout the
[[plane]]; this is a moment when intrigues bloom and stories are
shaped, a time for duels and grand declarations.
