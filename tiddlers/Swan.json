The company is based in [[Dura]] and owned by the Undalon, a family of [[Brelish|Breland]] [[dwarves|dwarf]] with long ties to the [[Boromar Clan]]. Swan coaches aren’t always pretty, but they’re ubiquitous and they’ll take you anywhere you want to go, no questions asked. See the <<navAndScrollToHeader \"Wards of Sharn\" \"Travel Time\">> section of [[Wards of Sharn]] for a breakdown of travel costs.\n\n[[Andala Undalon]] runs the daily operations of the Swan.",
