Their arcane gifts, which were tied to the [[overlord]] known as the [[Unmaker|Ran Iishiv]], helped them survive in this dangerous land, although madness and savagery claimed many of them.\n\nToday, their descendants form on of the [[Carrion Tribes]] of the [[Demon Wastes]], calling themselves the Brood of Ruin. The blood of [[Khyber]] runs strong in this tribe, and the [[Lords of Dust]] occasionally recruit powerful [[sorcerer]]s of the Brood, educating and training them to serve their schemes in the world beyond the wastes.",
