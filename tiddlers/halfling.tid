The diminutive halflings (or "talenta") of [[Eberron]] originate from eastern [[Khorvaire]], and many nomadic tribes of halflings still travel the [[Talenta Plains]]. The appearance of [[dragonmark]]s among the halflings spurred their slow migration across
Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of
Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use.

[[Lightfoot|lightfoot]] halflings are the more widespread halfling
subrace, especially in the Talenta Plains, but [[stout]] halflings are found within nearly every halfling community.

The term "halfling" is the term commonly used to refer to the folk of Talenta throughout [[Khorvaire]], dating back to their first contact with [[human]]s during the campaigns of [[Karrn the Conqueror]]. However, many prefer the traditional term "talenta", or the even older term "kuduk" (pl. "kudugin"), when referring to their race. Some talenta of the cities of the [[Five Nations]] derisively refer to the taller races as "doublefolk".

!! Appearance and Longevity

Halflings are inclined to be short and stout, standing about 3 feet tall, and weighing
between 40 and 45 pounds. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of their second century.

Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy
cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown
and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men
often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among
them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear
simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring
bright colors. 

!! Talenta Halflings

The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the
company of humans ended up looking very [[human]] in
dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the [[Talenta Plains]] could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride
domesticated [[dinosaur]]s across the wide plains. Those
few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are
visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and
expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the
strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.

As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the [[Last War]], and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the
spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.

Also, consider your relationship to the [[dinosaur]]s that
play a central role in the life of the Talenta halflings.
You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a [[clawfoot]] companion, take
on a [[fastieth]] form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a [[glidewing]] (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply
wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do),
adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur
companions, or adopt dinosaur-like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs of your
home remains strong.

Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The table below can provide some inspiration. 

| !<<dr d10>> |!Halfling Quirk |
| 1 |You are constantly amazed by things the people of the [[Five Nations]] take for granted. |
| 2 |You pattern your behavior on a species of dinosaur. |
| 3 |You are extremely curious, and you're always searching for new experiences. |
| 4 |You love to boast, and you're always tel ling exaggerated stories of your amazing adventures. |
| 5 |You wear a mask that you believe holds the spirit of your former dinosaur mount. You like to talk to it. |
| 6 |You don't understand the concept of "facts." To you, everything is a story, and truth is in how you tell it. |
| 7 |You are annoyed by buildings and tools designed without consideration for small people. |
| 8 |You seek vengeance for a wrong done to your people. |
| 9 |You never forget an insult or injury. |
| 10 |You ascribe everything to the work of spirits. |

!! Halflings of the Five Nations

Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural
talents to use as [[bard]]s, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout [[Khorvaire]]. Of course, these same
talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and
other criminals. 

Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the [[Boromar Clan]], the most powerful crime syndicate in [[Breland]]. The Boromars are based in [[Sharn]],
but their influence reaches across the nation and even
to the distant city of [[Stormreach]]. If you decide to play a
halfling [[rogue]], or a character with a [[Criminal]] or [[Charlatan]] [[background]], consider (with your GM) whether you
have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a
freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a
Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs.
Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar
leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take
your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your
past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the
point of contact who has made the Boromar Clan your
party's group patron.

!! Halflings and Dragonmarks

Two [[dragonmark]]s appear among the halflings of
[[Khorvaire]], the [[Mark of Healing]] in House [[Jorasco]] and
House [[Ghallanda]]'s [[Mark of Hospitality]]. Both marks are
ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the
same time that the [[elves|elf]] of [[Aerenal]] received their first
marks—centuries before the arrival of [[human]]s on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of House Ghallanda joke that
their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by
allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in
Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the
services provided by both halfling houses helped enable
the spread of humanity across the continent.

With its powers related to food and shelter, the Mark
of Hospitality was a boon to the early halfling nomads,
but now it allows House Ghallanda to run the best inns,
hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the Mark of
Healing has always been a boon to both nomads and
settlers facing dangerous wilds, and House Jorasco still
employs both magical and mundane healing techniques
to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.
