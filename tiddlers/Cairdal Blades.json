        "text": "A small, elite force, the Cairdal Blades are the elite soldiers and agents of the [[Sibling Kings]] of [[Aerenal]]. They consist mostly of light skirmishers, along with a\nfew [[wizard]]s to provide magical support. A few [[deathless]]\nsoldiers of legendary reputation bolster the Bladesâ€™ power.\nDue to the traces of [[Phiarlan]] blood still coursing through\nAerenal, the [[Mark of Shadow]] appears once or twice in each\ngeneration. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted\ninto the Blades and generally trained as spies and assassins.\n\nSuperbly trained and well equipped, the Cairdal Blades\nprovide [[Aerenal]] with a highly effective force that can operate\nacross [[Eberron]]. In theory, the Blades serve the [[Sibling Kings]],\nbut some believe that their first loyalty is to the [[Undying Court]]; is there a cabal within the Court carrying out plans that the living rulers of Aerenal know nothing about?",
