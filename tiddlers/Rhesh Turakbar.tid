Rhesh Turakbar is [[minotaur]] [[warlord]] of [[Droaam]] who commands a clan of [[demon]]-worshipping barbarians from the fortress of [[Turakbar's Fist]]. He is a massive creature covered in dark fur and scars, as well as fiendish body modifications.

Rhesh follows the demon lord known as the Horned Prince, thought to be an aspect of the [[Rage of War|Rak Tulkhesh]]. Many of
the victims of Turakbar raids are brutally sacrificed
to slake the blood thirst of the [[overlord]] of [[minotaur]]s.
Rhesh and his followers are said to wield [[demon]]ic
power bestowed by their dark lord. They believe the Horned Prince's favored servants are the [[goristro]]s, and file their teeth to jagged points to better resemble them.

Though the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] tolerate Rhesh Turakbar, they and the minotaur
are not strong allies. However, the warlord’s bloody
sorties into western [[Breland]] are useful to the hags,
since they provide critical information on the state of
Breland’s defenses—and stoke the fear of a full-scale
[[Droaam]] invasion that grips that land.
