        "text": "A blocky stone tower overlooking the [[Howling River]] in [[Wroat]] midway between [[Brokenblade Castle]] (King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]]’s palace) and [[Parliament Hall]], the Tower of Inquisition is used for the interrogation of prisoners apprehended by House [[Medani]] or by King Boranel’s agents. It is also where Baron [[Trelib d'Medani]] manages the [[Warning Guild]]’s affairs. Those who visit as diplomats see only a few well-appointed pavilions near the top of the tower. Those who are subject to Medani interrogation in the warrens below rarely speak of what they’ve seen—and since they’re usually imprisoned by [[Breland]] or another authority afterward, they have few opportunities to describe their experiences.\n\nUnderground passages and permanent long-range [[dimension door]]s are said to connect the tower and [[Brokenblade Castle]], created so that the enclave might be used as a secret refuge in the [[Last War]], but this rumor has never been confirmed. \n\nThe Tower also houses the shrine which serves as the headquarters of the [[Voice of Aureon]].",
