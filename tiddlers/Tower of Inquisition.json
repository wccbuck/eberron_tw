        "text": "A blocky stone tower in [[Wroat]] (capital of [[Breland]]) midway between [[Brokenblade Castle]] (King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]]’s palace) and [[Parliament Hall]], the Tower of\nInquisition is used for the interrogation of prisoners apprehended by House [[Medani]] or by King Boranel’s agents. It is also where Baron [[Trelib d'Medani]] manages the [[Warning Guild]]’s affairs. Those who visit as diplomats see only a few well-appointed pavilions near the top of the tower. Those who are subject to Medani interrogation in the warrens below rarely speak of what they’ve seen—and since they’re usually imprisoned by [[Breland]] or another authority afterward, they have few opportunities to describe their experiences.",
