        "text": "This is the [[Xoriat]] stronghold and birthplace of the [[daelkyr]] [[Belashyrra]].\nThe Lord of Eyes imagined the [[beholder]]s and brought that\nvision to life, and the Citadel is home to a host of beholderkin.\nTiny floating eyes buzz about like insects. Millipede-like\ncreatures have rows of eyes running down their backs. The true\nbeholders are mostly focused in deep contemplation of specific\nthings, and don't pay attention to outsiders unless they're\ndisturbed. Some study strange paintings. Others watch scrying\npools reflecting images of [[Eberron]] or other planes. And some\nexamine seemingly mundane objects, such as a rusty iron key,\na dead rabbit, or an expensive hat. However, there are a few\nthat patrol the Citadel, watchful for intruders.\n\nThe surfaces of the Citadel are made from an iridescent\nmaterial that your eyes can't quite focus on, as if the walls and\nfloor are blurred. There are mirrors spread around the halls.\nSome run slow and show you younger than you are; others\nshow glimpses of the future. Scrying pools reveal secrets you\ndon't want to knowâ€”current events on Eberron, scenes from\nthe past, or the possible future.",
