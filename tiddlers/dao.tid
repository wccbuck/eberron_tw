The [[dao]] are [[genie]]s of elemental earth who crafted the [[City of Brass]] and the [[azer]]s who maintain it, and continue to craft grand and remarkable wonders in their native [[plane]] of [[Fernia]].

Each dao has a particular specialty, a unique style of art or artifice. While they can
craft artifacts that would be the envy of any mortal [[artificer]],
their techniques can't be easily replicated. Their work has an
element of arcane science, but much of what they do involves
channeling the essence of [[Fernia]] itself; a dao who settles in
the Material Plane will find its talents more limited.

The dao are more stoic than the fiery [[efreet|efreeti]], and don't throw
extravagant parties. But they still engage in intense social
competition with one another, striving to craft the most glorious
creations. This doesn't necessarily mean their work is the
most powerful; rather, it's about creating things that are most
desired. The dao don't need gold, so the efreet usually pay them
in barter, which creates a bizarre secondary market. The efreeti
[[Raqashtar]] might offer a squad of elite [[salamander]] warriors in
exchange for a wondrous crown; the dao has no use for them,
but it knows that the efreeti [[Azhalar]] is collecting soldiers, so...

Adventurers may seek out dao because of what they can do,
but dao can also be interesting patrons. A dao may need some
rare substance to complete its latest work, but it can only be
obtained on the Material Planeâ€”so it turns to adventurers
to obtain it. Or a dao could even use a group of mortals as a
focus group, seeking opinions on its latest work.
