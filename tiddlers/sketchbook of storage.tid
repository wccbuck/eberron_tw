title: sketchbook of storage
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This large sketchbook has rough, charcoal-stained pages. The user can press objects into the pages; the object vanishes and leaves behind an incredibly lifelike charcoal illustration. Objects can be removed whenever the user desires, allowing this book to be used as a means of extradimensional storage such as a [[bag of holding]].
