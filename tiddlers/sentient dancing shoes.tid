title: sentient dancing shoes
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

These delicate, red silk shoes are sentient, and prefer to go by the name Bianca. Her nature is very noble and lady-like. She is capable of leading the user through every dance imaginable, however she is a very stubborn pair of shoes. She will throw a fit and refuse to move if the user's feet smell, or if the ground is muddy.
