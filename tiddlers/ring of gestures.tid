This gaudy ring has a delicately carved pink gem in the shape of a hand at its center. While wearing this ring, you can create an [[illusion]] at will to enlarge (up to 5 feet in any dimension), reduce, or change the color of the hand wearing the ring or any of its fingers. In addition, whenever you make a gesture with the hand wearing this ring, the pink gemstone moves to mimic the gesture and remains that way until you make a new one.
