The [[oni]] [[sorcerer]] Yrnuxi is the actual power in [[Mokush]]; she and a small subsection of the village are members of the [[Horned Shadow]].
She masquerades as the [[Chosen]] lady [[Galshani]], who
seems to be a healthier and more spry of late, despite
her advancing years. The real Galshani spends a lot of
time sleeping, and is under Yrnuxi's power, but not in
such a way that the oni could easily be given away
if Galshani were to be possessed by a [[quori]] (which hasn't
happened in over a decade). Most of Mokush's [[ogre]]s know
Yrnuxi as a harsh and influential reeve, unusual for an
ogre mage, and nothing more.
