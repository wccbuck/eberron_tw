At first glance, First Tower
doesn’t appear to deserve a mention alongside such massive
population centers as [[Sharn]] and [[Wroat]]. If a settlement
were judged solely on the number of permanent residents (just over 300),
then the place might not even appear on a [[Brelish|Breland]] map.
As the gateway to Sharn from the northern land passages,
however, First Tower earns prominence and notoriety
befitting the number of travelers who regularly pass
through its humble environs.

The town grew up around a single stone tower,
maybe thirty feet high, that legends claim was the first
tower built in the greater [[Sharn]] region. Long before
any of Sharn’s massive structures climbed into the sky,
the people of First Tower believe, the stones of their
ancient spire were stacked one atop the other. Historians dispute this legend, because the tower and the ramshackle inn that has been built around it are clearly
not as old as the ancient [[goblinoid]] foundations upon
which Sharn grew. The people of First Tower nod, smile
politely, and leave the scholars to their delusions, for
they know in their hearts that they live in an historic
and significant location.

Regardless of the accuracy of the place’s history, First
Tower serves an important role in the cycle of life around
[[Sharn]]. Those traveling to or from Sharn by land, whether
walking, riding, or as passengers in a caravan or lightning
rail, have only one route they can take. This route cuts
through the crags and cliffs upon which Sharn sits, slices
north, and passes through the settlement of First Tower. Whether coming from or going to Sharn, if you travel by
land you must pass through First Tower.

All the residents of First Tower earn a living by catering to the travelers moving through the settlement. The inn employs most of them, for travelers need to eat, drink,
relax, and have a place to stay while waiting for the next
outbound caravan or for their papers to clear so they can
enter the City of Towers.

The [[lightning rail]] station, the caravan stables, a general store, and the crown’s checkpoint make up the rest of
the town, as well as a scattering of houses where the locals
live. Royal clerks stationed at the checkpoint examine the
[[identification|identification papers]] and [[traveling papers]] of everyone seeking to
travel to [[Sharn]] proper. The checkpoint maintains a small
garrison that enforces order in First Tower and keeps the
place safe from bandits and marauders who sometimes slip
out of the [[King's Forest]].
