Led by the cruel [[hobgoblin]] [[Baalo One-Eye]], the Khraal Lords terrorize the\nscattered [[goblinoid]] communities of southern [[Darguun]]. The\nband also possesses two small warships it recovered from a\n[[Cyran|Cyre]] base on the [[Ghaal River]]. Now Baalo and his followers\nuse the ships to raid vessels crossing [[Kraken Bay]], though\nthey avoid prey that is better armed or more sea-savvy than\nthemselves (which includes most ships they come across).\nFor this reason, the Khraal Lords have begun sending\nscavenging forays into the [[Mournland]] from the southern\nsea. With few connections outside [[Darguun]], Baalo has been\nselling whatever relics he acquires to a House [[Deneith]] clerk\nwho tends an outpost in [[Wyvernskull]]. The clerk, a hireling\nwithout blood ties to the house, pays a third of what the relics\nare worth and has been selling them, in turn, to Prince\n[[Oargev|Oargev ir'Wynarn]] of [[New Cyre]] for a handsome profit.",
