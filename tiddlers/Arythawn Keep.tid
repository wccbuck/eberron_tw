tags: enclave Medani Thrane fortress
title: Arythawn Keep
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This fort in southeast [[Thrane]], heavily damaged in the [[Last War]], has recently seen an
influx of House [[Medani]] personnel, all members of the [[Thousand Yard Stare]], which is charged with patrolling the borders of the [[Mournland]].
The house has entered into an arrangement with Thrane: The [[Medani]]s will
repair the keep in exchange for the right to garrison the riders of the Thousand Yard Stare there. Columns of cavalry are always arriving and departing to the eastâ€”a quick ford of the [[Brey River]], and the riders are in the [[Mournland]].
