Luunkashtai is sister and Hand to [[Chanaakar]], the Speaker of the [[Keepers of the Word]] and spiritual leader of [[Adar]]. 

Chanaakar's sister was every bit as precocious as her
brother, though her talents run more to the mastery of
the body than of the mind. Still, she is [[kalashtar]], as was
their mother, and she knows the importance of balance. Luunkashtai has always loved her brother deeply,
and she places her duty to him at the highest priority.
However, since [[Raadu Xeel]] and the [[Endseekers]] attacked
Chanaakar, she has been more watchful and involved
with the community of [[Kasshta Keep]]. Her position as
the Speaker's Hand is a respected one, but she has also
earned the right to lead the Kashtai line of [[kalashtar]] in
the citadel. Some might say that being a member of the
elder council and a servant of the Speaker's is a conflict
of interest, but nobody questions Luunkashtai's sense of
duty and honor.

Luunkashtai has given birth to many children. [[Chanaakar]] appreciates being an uncle more than Luunkashtai likes being a mother, but the communal raising of children in [[Kasshta Keep]] allowed her to fulfill what she felt were her obligations to the future of the kalashtar while remaining a warrior. All six of Luunkashtai's living
children are adults, serving either in Kasshta Keep or
elsewhere in the land of refuge. Three others have died
on the borders in skirmishes with [[Riedra]]ns.
