type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This ebony longbow is speckled with silver leaves, and is wielded by champions of the [[Silver Flame]]. This blessed weapon faintly glows with holy light. Arrows fired from it are considered "silvered" when used against creatures with a weakness to silver, such as [[therianthrope]]s, and are extra effective against [[undead]] and [[fiend]]s.
