A figure of dark legend, [[Mordain the Fleshweaver]] was driven from the [[Twelve]] after his attempts to create new life went horribly awry, and since then he has lingered in the shadows of [[Droaam]]. The strangest of the horrors and wonders of the [[Forest of Flesh]] is the village of [[Dolurrh]]'s Dawn, a bizarre point of light deep within the Kingdom of Monsters.

!! Overview

Dolurrh's Dawn is a hamlet of 104 people. The origin of the village is a mystery even to those who live there. On [[Dravago 11th, 996 YK|Khorvaire calendar]], these people awoke in their beds in the village. Each one of them remembered their name and the name of the village... and nothing else. Despite this amnesia, each villager found that they could draw upon talents lying beyond conscious memory—skills they couldn’t remember learning. This last year has been a struggle for survival in a very dangerous land. Working together, the people of Dolurrh’s Dawn have crafted weapons, learned to hunt the vicious beasts of the [[forest|Forest of Flesh]], and slowly created a life in this savage land.

A village of amnesiacs appearing from nowhere is strange enough, but the inhabitants of Dolurrh’s Dawn haven’t even realized the true extent of the mystery surrounding their little community. The people of the village know their own names, but they remember nothing about the past... and as such, when they first awoke, they didn’t recognize any of the other inhabitants of the village. But the first travelers who discover this village are in for a shock. A [[dwarf]] named Kordran serves as the town blacksmith. His face might seem familiar to anyone who has been to the [[Mror Holds]], and it shouldn’t take long to realize why: they’ve seen it carved into the side of the [[Ironroot Mountains]], in a [[monument over a mile in height|Great Stone Face of Mror]]. He is Lord Kordran Mror, the greatest king to ever rule the realm beneath the mountains. The mud-spattered huntress is [[Lhazaar]], the explorer who led [[human]]ity to the shores of [[Khorvaire]]. [[Galifar I|Galifar Wynarn]] sits at a table with [[Karrn the Conqueror]] and [[Jarot|Jarot ir'Wynarn]], the last ruler of the [[kingdom|Galifar]] Galifar founded. This is a village filled with heroes and legends—yet none of them remember their heroic deeds, nor do they possess the full skills spoken of in the stories. So what are they? Has [[Mordain|Mordain the Fleshweaver]] found a way to pull these ancient spirits back from the afterlife, in violation of the laws of [[Dolurrh]]? Or are these people simulacrums created by the Fleshweaver—clones with vestiges of the heroes’ memories, but no true trace of their souls? Either way, what does Mordain have to gain from this experiment, and why has he chosen the subjects that he has?

!! The People of Dolurrh's Dawn

At a glance, the inhabitants of Dolurrh’s Dawn can fit into any village in the [[Five Nations]]. While mostly [[human]], the village has a scattering of other races, including a handful of [[dwarves|dwarf]], [[elves|elf]], [[gnome]]s, and even [[orc]]s, spread among the community. Most are dressed in homespun clothing, and the calluses and dirt on their skin tell the tale of their struggle to survive. They are all roughly the same age, once species deviation is taken into account; the [[human]]s are in their mid- to late-twenties, with the other races at an age that would bring them to a similar level of maturity. But there are no village elders and no children—and so far, only one pregnancy (that of [[Aundair Wynarn]]). The people know absolutely nothing about the outside world. Those few who have set out in search of a greater civilization have never returned; presumably they fell prey to the many dangers of the [[Forest of Flesh]] or the equally hostile environs of [[Droaam]]. As a result, a number of theories are circulating around the village. Some believe that this is a form of afterlife. Those who have memories of arcane lore believe they have been transported to another [[plane]] of existence—either the madness of [[Xoriat]] or a sort of [[Dal Quor]] dreamscape. In any case, all the villagers are surprised and thrilled to encounter travelers from the outside world. Some might treat strangers with suspicion, fearing that this is a trick of the forest, but the majority begs for tales of the world beyond the woods and anything that can fill the gaps in their memories.

Most of what the villagers know comes to them as instinct. Aside from their names, most of them have only vague memories of their former lives, glimpses seen in half-remembered dreams. [[Malleon|Malleon the Reaver]] is a brutal soldier, but he doesn’t remember how he learned to use the greataxe; likewise, he remembers nothing about [[Lhazaar]], but he feels a strange loyalty toward her. The [[dwarves|dwarf]] in the village have rallied around Kordran Mror. The [[Wynarns|Wynarn family]] know from their family name and broad physical resemblance that they must be related, but they don’t know exactly how; lacking any evidence to the contrary, they’ve assumed that they are all siblings or cousins. If the pcs reveal the true relations between these people—including the fact that [[Karrn|Karrn the Conqueror]] is a distant ancestor of [[Galifar|Galifar Wynarn]]—it could improve relations, or it could make them much worse.

Here are a few of the more remarkable inhabitants of the village.

* ''Galifar Wynarn''. This is [[Galifar I|Galifar Wynarn]], the man who united the [[Five Nations]] and created a [[kingdom|Galifar]] that lasted for a thousand years. Even in this village of generals and kings, his charisma and ingenuity are truly remarkable. Galifar brought order after the villagers first awoke, and he coordinated the construction of the stockade wall. He has become the de facto leader of Dolurrh’s Dawn, but many envy his influence, especially Karrn, Dorius, and Malleon.
* ''Ashalyn Vol''. An [[Aereni]] [[necromancer|necromancy]] born over three thousand years ago, Ashalyn laid many cornerstones of the [[Vol]] practices of preserving their honored elders as [[oathbound|mummy]] and [[lich]]es. In life, she possessed knowledge of a vast array of rituals, especially those involving necromantic magic. Either she doesn’t remember her past... or she’s choosing to hide it from her companions.
* ''Aundair Wynarn''. A daughter of [[Galifar Wynarn]], [[Aundair|Aundair Wynarn]] was one of the greatest [[wizard]]s in Galifar’s army. Kind and gentle by nature, she is working with Ashalyn and Dorius to try to reconstruct their memories of magical rituals. She and Cael Vadallia fell in love, and Aundair is six months pregnant with Cael’s child... which could be the first [[half-elf]] in Dolurrh’s Dawn.
* ''Cael Vadallia''. A legendary [[Tairnadal]] archer from the [[Age of Giants]], chosen by his honored ancestor [[Vadallia]], and himself a distant ancestor of the current [[High King|Shaeras Vadallia]] of [[Valenar]], Cael Vadallia is also a skilled hunter. He has used his talents as a bowyer and fletcher to craft weapons for the village. A noble soul, he instinctively despises cruelty and tyranny and dislikes Karrn and Malleon.
* ''Dorius Alyre Korran''. The founder of the [[Library of Korranberg]] and a brilliant scholar, [[Dorius|Dorius Alyre ir'Korran]] plays the part of a kindly arcane sage. However, behind this mask he is a greedy schemer who seeks personal power. He won’t challenge Galifar openly, but he is quietly using Karrn and Malleon to undermine Galifar’s influence.
* ''Kaius ir'Wynarn''. [[Kaius|Kaius ir'Wynarn I]] is the son of [[Jarot ir'Wynarn]], and he is the leader who rebelled against [[Mishann|Mishann ir'Wynarn]] of [[Cyre]] sparking the [[Last War]], and who instituted the harsh [[Code of Kaius]] in [[Karrnath]]. Some PCs might know that Kaius I exists as a [[vampire]] in [[Khorvaire]] today; this reborn Kaius is drawn from the point the current Kaius "died". He is a proud man who cares deeply about the safety of the people of the village, and he has become the “innkeeper” of the Sunrise tavern, where he tends to the daily needs of the villagers. Currently he is a strong supporter of Galifar, but he is growing closer to Ashalyn Vol. If Ashalyn recreates the rituals of vampirism, perhaps Kaius will become a [[vampire]] once more!
* ''Karrn''. The founder of pre-[[Galifar]] [[Karrnath]], [[Karrn the Conqueror]] is a brilliant tactical warlord. His flaws are his cruelty and his ego, and these have kept the other villagers from turning to him for leadership. He is deeply jealous of Galifar, but as a tactician he realizes that the village can’t afford to lose such a skilled man. Nonetheless, he often challenges Galifar’s decisions, and this tension will only grow over time.
* ''Kordran Mror''. Kordran is the greatest king of the [[dwarven|dwarf]] nation that once lay [[below|Realm Below]] the [[Ironroot Mountains]]—a nation destroyed long ago by the [[daelkyr]]. Kordran is a calm, wise person and has chosen to support Galifar. He is a skilled smith and has created both weapons and tools for the community; now they are in desparate need of ore.
* ''Jarot ir'Wynarn''. The last king of the united [[Galifar]], [[Jarot|Jarot ir'Wynarn]] is the weakest of the Wynarns in all senses of the word. His greatest flaw is his paranoia, and he will be the first to accuse PCs of treachery or deception. He is a skilled siege engineer and helps to maintain the village walls.
* ''Jazalaen Elorrenthi''. An ancestor of the [[elves|elf]] who would eventually form House [[Phiarlan]], Jazalaen is a battle dancer who supposedly blinded a king of the [[giant]]s with her graceful motions and flashing blades. In addition to hunting the beasts of the forest, Jazalaen entertains the villagers with her dazzling performances.
* ''Lhazaar''. [[Lhazaar]] is the explorer and pirate queen who led the first great wave of [[human]]ity to [[Khorvaire]]. The circumstances of her death remain a mystery, since her flagship disappeared in a great storm. Lhazaar is inquisitive and charismatic, with some of the talents of a leader supporting her deadly skill with her blades. She is intrigued by Galifar and so far she has chosen not to oppose him; however, this could easily change. she is one of the most active explorers in the villager and knows much about the [[Forest of Flesh]].
* ''Malleon Kas''. During [[Lhazaar]]'s colonization of [[Khorvaire]], [[Malleon|Malleon the Reaver]] earned the sobriquet “the Reaver” due to his brutal slaughter of the native [[goblinoid]]s. He is a giant of a man, possessing immense strength and a fearsome glare. Though he lacks the memories of his past, he is devoted to Lhazaar; however, she is more interested in Galifar. Malleon would love to see Galifar slain and Lhazaar in his place. Malleon is a vicious bigot and despises all nonhumans.
* ''Rasha Torrn''.  The [[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]] [[druid]]s brought an end to the incursion of [[Xoriat]] into [[Eberron]], and Rasha [[Torrn]] brought the druids together for that final sealing ritual. She has yet to regain access to her mystical powers. Nonetheless, she is wise and a skilled healer, with great knowledge of the natural world.
* ''Sasselassum''. Born in the [[Talenta Plains]] thousands of years ago, Sasselassum is a [[halfling]] trickster whose deeds are the stuff of hundreds of Talentan folktales. Though clever and experienced in the ways of the natural world, Sasselassum is impulsive; his curiosity and impetuous nature often get him into trouble.
* ''Talas Thorn''.  Talas is a [[human]] priest of the [[Sovereign Host]], born in [[Sharn]] in the year 687 YK. He is friendly enough and a talented healer, but otherwise unremarkable—a man who left no mark on history. However, many remarkable events occurred during his lifetime... could it be that his role in them was never discovered? Was he one of the worst serial killers in Sharn’s history? Was he a secret servant of the [[Traveler]], or an agent of the [[Lords of Dust]]? Or is he just the kind priest he appears to be?

These are just a few possibilities. Many other historical figures could be interesting. [[Aeren]], the prophet who led the elves away from [[Xen'drik]]. [[Aaren d'Cannith]], creator of the [[warforged]]. [[Tira Miron]], the founder of the modern church of the [[Silver Flame]]. [[Halas Tarkanan]], greatest leader of the [[aberrant|aberrant dragonmark]] forces in the [[War of the Mark]]. Erandis [[Vol]], last scion of the [[Mark of Death]]. A [[therianthrope]] from the time of the [[Silver Crusade]]. Beyond this, many other people whose role in history is unknown, like Talas Thorn, could be here.

Another option is to have a few people whose only real significance appears to be their connection to the player characters. The wife of the PC fighter, who was slain during the [[Last War]]. The party’s favorite innkeeper, who was killed during a bar brawl with the enemies of the PCs. Why would [[Mordain|Mordain the Fleshweaver]] choose to resurrect a simple innkeeper? Is this entire experiment being conducted for the benefit of the PCs? Or is there an important secret about the innkeeper (he’s an [[Inspired]] plant; an agent of the [[Chamber]]; last member of an exotic bloodline) the PCs never discovered?

!! The Shape of the Village

Dolurrh’s Dawn is a village under siege. The surrounding [[forest|Forest of Flesh]] is filled with monsters and threats that stagger the imagination. Raging [[grue]]s, hungry [[grick]]s, and lurking [[skinweaver]]s are just a few of the horrors the villagers have to deal with on a regular basis. When the PCs approach Dolurrh’s Dawn, the first thing that they see is the high stockade wall surrounding it. Sharpened tree-trunks are lashed together, and deep gashes in the wood suggest the work of claws and acid. A half-dozen archers patrol the walls at all hours, ready to raise the alarm at the slightest sign of trouble. There are no gates in the wall. Ropes are used by those agile enough to climb, while a makeshift stretcher-and-pulley system allows larger objects to be brought up and over the stockade.

Inside, Dolurrh’s Dawn is a study in contrasts. A number of ramshackle buildings constructed using the same limited resources as the wall are within the village. But the heart of the village has a few structures of quarried stone, with windows of magically hardened glass and all the amenities one would expect to find in [[Fairhaven]] or [[Wroat]]. These are the buildings the villagers found themselves in when they first awoke. These include a well of magically purified water and a public latrine in the town square; a simple forge contained in the building where Kordran Mror works; and a few simple, solid cottages. The final structure is a large tavern, bearing a trade sign marked with the symbol of a sun rising over a black field. The locals call this Sunrise, and it is both the town hall and canteen for Dolurrh’s Dawn. The Wynarns have laid claim to the living quarters in sunrise, and Kaius has taken over the maintenance of the building. In general, however, the villagers are living a hard frontier life; whatever they need—including ore for the forge—must be found in the wilds. Many of the villagers would consider something as simple as paper and ink to be a treasure; the mages of the village have been using a variety of makeshift materials to produce a book of rituals.

The people of Dolurrh’s Dawn have little to offer outsiders. However, the hunters and gatherers have become adept at finding food in the deadly [[forest|Forest of Flesh]]. The crafters of the village are nonetheless masters of their respective trades, and this might be an opportunity for PCs: Kordran Mror might have limited resources, but he’s still known as one of the greatest smiths in the history of [[Khorvaire]], and an axe forged by his hands could have considerable power.

!! Using Dolurrh's Dawn

Dolurrh’s Dawn can serve many different roles. To begin with, it is an unexpected sanctuary in a dangerous place. It’s not easy to find a safe haven in the [[Forest of Flesh]], and adventurers who have used their last reserves in a battle with [[skinweaver]]s might be thrilled when they see the high walls and friendly lights of this village. The GM needs to decide the degree to which the inhabitants of the village have recovered their old skills (something which can vary by individual). If the villagers are still neophytes, then they might need the party’s help to survive the deadly threats posed by the forest. On the other hand, if the people of the village have regained their legendary skills, they might be powerful allies in a struggle against an epic threat—or a source of unexpected treasure. While the weapon might not be pretty, an axe forged by Kordran Mror or bow carved by Cael Vadallia could possess tremendous magical might.

Another question is whether the villagers want to leave Dolurrh’s Dawn. Getting a hundred people across [[Droaam]] would be a challenge in its own right, but the greater issue is the impact these people would have on the world. If it can be proven that Galifar truly is who he says he is and not a [[doppelganger]] or [[demon]], how would his return affect the [[Five Nations]]? What would happen between the living [[Kaius|Kaius ir'Wynarn I]] and the [[vampire|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]]? Might [[Karrn the Conqueror]] seize [[Karrnath]] away from Kaius and start the war anew? Upon learning about the fragile state of the world, Galifar might insist that all the villagers remain in Dolurrh's Dawn, refusing to let their return bring chaos to a fragile world.

In addition to serving as a backdrop for adventure, Dolurrh’s Dawn could also serve as an origin for a character. There’s no reason the villagers have to be NPCs. If he wanted, a player could choose to play the reborn [[Galifar|Galifar Wynarn]], [[Karrn the Conqueror]], or any other figure from history. Reborn in Dolurrh’s Dawn, he has made his way to the [[Five Nations]]—what happens next? Does this reborn champion have an epic destiny to fulfill, or is he [[Mordain|Mordain the Fleshweaver]]’s idea of a cosmic joke?

If its people resemble the heroes of the past but have few of their powers or skills, Dolurrh’s Dawn can be used as a strange village in a surprising location. If the villagers possess some of their old talents, it can be a source of powerful allies or deadly enemies. Either way, Dolurrh’s Dawn is a remarkable place—and a disturbing sign of the power of [[Mordain the Fleshweaver]].
