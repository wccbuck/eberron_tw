This [[mithral]] longsword is of [[Aereni|Aerenal]] design, bearing script along the blade that reads "arelind," an [[elven|Aerenese]] word that means "ally" or "champion of the people." These blades are often gifts given by elven [[wizard]]s to non-elven allies of great esteem.

This fine blade sheds dim light when unsheathed. In addition, the wielder can speak, read, and write the [[Aerenese]] language as long as the sword is on their person.
