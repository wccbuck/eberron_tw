Kularket is a [[jungle giant|hill giant]] spirit shaman of the [[Guardians of Rushemé]], and is one of the strongest spellcasters among the Guardians. Her tribe lives in the heart of the deepest jungles of [[Xen'drik]], but she occasionally uses [[tree stride]] to visit [[Gaulronak]] and study the cursed city of [[Stormreach]]. During
the Fire Storm, when the [[Battalion of the Basalt Towers]] attacked the city over fifty years ago, Kularket led the forces of Rushemé in their stand against the [[fire giant]]s. Kularket prefers to avoid dealing with the little people, but she might assist adventurers who have become champions of [[Rushemé]].
