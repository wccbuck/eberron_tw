''Population:'' <<ntls>>

On the rocky southern slopes of the [[Starpeaks]], east of the [[Trumpet Mountains]], stands the once mighty community of Daskaran. It is perhaps best known for its white-needled coniferous trees and neatly cobbled streets. Long ago, Daskaran was a vital trade center and the capital of the pre-[[Galifar]] kingdom of [[Daskara]], but today its importance has diminished.

In [[696 YK|Khorvaire calendar]], a disastrous fire swept through the city, reducing most of it to rubble. With few supplies left to enable them to survive the winter, the locals descended the foothills to winter in the south, with many fleeing to [[Flamekeep]]. Most never returned.

Three centuries later, Daskaran still hasn’t fully recovered—old stone buildings, many scorched still, line the neat roads, shadowed by the white-needled pines blanketing the hills. Large temples dedicated to [[Dol Arrah]] and the [[Silver Flame]] flank a courtyard dominated by a statue of [[Tira Miron]] astride a horse, with sword raised. As the [[sun|Sun]] marches across the heavens, the shadow cast from the sword marks the hours of the day.
