        "text": "The Municipal Guard of [[Breland]] is a division of the army charged with the defense the nation's major population centers. It was established early in the [[Last War]], but has significantly diminished in scope and resources over the last fifty years; as of 998 YK, the Municipal Guard is largely a ceremonial force, and does not approach the elite reputation of the [[King's Shields]] or the [[Redcloak Battalion]].\n\n!! The Municipal Guard in Sharn\n\nIn [[Sharn]], the Municipal Guard's headquarters is located in [[Daggerwatch]], [[Upper Dura]]. The city only came under attack once during the course of the [[Last War]], and even if the war began again tomorrow, it is unlikely that Sharn would be threatened. However, [[Dura]] is an unstable region, and on occasion the Guard has been mobilized to support the [[Watch|Sharn Watch]] in suppressing riots. After the fall of the\n[[Glass Tower]] in 918 YK, the Municipal Guard played a vital role in stabilizing the region and maintaining martial law in Dura. \n\nNot one to let his forces go to waste, Captain [[Toras Cant]] has a longstanding arrangement with the [[Boromar Clan]] and usually supplies the muscle for Boromar operations, in exchange for gold and [[dreamlily]].\n\nWhen in uniform, guardsmen are equipped with scale mail, a longsword and light\nsteel shield, and either a glaive or light crossbow. When working for the [[Boromars|Boromar Clan]], the guardsmen are usually lightly armed, though the Boromar Clan could provide them with superior equipment for a special assignment.",
