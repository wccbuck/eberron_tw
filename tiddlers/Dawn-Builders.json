These Dawn-Builders\nnever know where they’ll be going next, because\nChervina doesn’t announce the location of her next\nproject in advance, her whims guided by the [[Draconic Prophecy]]. They might spend their summer\nbuilding an enclave in the [[Shadow Marches]], then construct another in the [[Eldeen Reaches]] in the autumn, before heading to the [[Aundair]]-[[Breland]] border to start\nan enclave that Chervina says must be finished before\nspring. Sometimes Chervina employs mercenaries\nfrom House [[Deneith]] or rangers from House [[Tharashk]]\nto keep her Dawn-Builders safe, but often she relies on\nHouse Ghallanda guards or local adventurers.",
