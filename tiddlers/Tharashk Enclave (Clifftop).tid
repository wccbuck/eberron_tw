The [[House of Finding|Tharashk]] has a
great interest in [[Xen'drik]] and the mineral wealth
that can be found there, as well as an interest in the
other dark lands of [[Eberron]]â€”[[Q'barra]], the [[Demon Wastes]], [[Khyber]], and the [[Mournland]]. The [[Tharashk]] [[enclave]] in [[Clifftop]] is primarily concerned
with exploration and prospecting. The house sells
the services of guides, and many of its members
have firsthand experience in Xen'drik and Khyber.  It is careful to retain only
guides who receive positive referrals from [[guild|Clifftop Adventurers' Guild]] members.
In addition to the powers of their [[dragonmark]]s,
these guides can provide invaluable information
about the threats lurking in these regions. When
the house plans expeditions to Xen'drik, these are
usually arranged at the Clifftop enclave. Due to
the rivalry with [[Tharashk]] and [[Deneith]], the house
often recruits adventurers to protect an expedition
instead of hiring Deneith mercenaries.
