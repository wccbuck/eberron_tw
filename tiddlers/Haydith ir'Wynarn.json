        "text": "Following the [[Treaty of Thronehold]], King [[Kaius III|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] of [[Karrnath]] and King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] of [[Breland]] agreed to an exchange of hostages of sorts—each sending members of their family to live in the foreign court, a program intended to solidify the peace accords. Boranel sent his children Halix and Borina, and Kaius sent his twenty-year-old younger sister, Haydith.\n\nA brilliant, sharp-witted gothic princess, Haydith arrived in [[Wroat]] one year ago, miserable and depressed. However, she has since opened up to the wonders of the city, and she’s said to have become quite popular at court. That said, she still feels like a stranger trying to find her place in [[Breland]]. She’s currently a pawn in Boranel and Kaius’s game of [[Conqueror]], and she wants to change the game; she may end up being a suitor for Prince [[Oargev|Oargev ir'Wynarn]] of [[New Cyre]], sympathizing with his immense loss (“Most of my friends are dead too. Or undead.”). If she did end up with Oargev, she’d push for him to do something truly unexpected.",
