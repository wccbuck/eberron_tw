This order specialized in [[transmutation]] and [[necromancy]] and dabbled in the forbidden\nlore of the [[daelkyr]] and the [[Dragon Below|Khyber]]. It's said that\nthe members of the Closed Circle went mad and sought\nto summon terrible things; whatever the truth, the guild\nwas wiped out more than two hundred years ago by the\ncombined action of the Church of the [[Silver Flame]], the\n[[Esoteric Order|Esoteric Order of Aureon]], and the [[Guild of Starlight and Shadows]].\nHidden workshops of the Closed Circle might still be\nfound in Sharn, where vengeful [[lich]]es or other [[wizard]]s\nof the Circle practice their dark arts in hiding.
