type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

//Mayne Jhaelian wears the black and gold robes of a priest of the [[Undying Court]], with the golden mask of the Court on a chain around his neck. But beneath this finery his skin is mottled and cold, and his vivid green eyes are the only sign of life in his frozen face. His voice is a rasping whisper, as if it is difficult for him to draw breath into rotting lungs.//

Despite his appearance, Mayne is not [[undead]]. For generations, [[elves|elf]] of the [[line|Aereni noble line]] of [[Jhaelian]] have used magical and alchemical treatments to mimic the appearance of the dead. 

Mayne Jhaelian is a [[cleric]] of the [[Undying Court]] and head priest of the [[Gates of Passage]] in [[Shae Lias]], [[Sharn]]. He is also a confidant of Ambassador [[Taelira]] of the [[Aerenal Embassy|Aerenal Embassy (Sharn)]].

Jhaelian has ties to the [[Deathguard]] of [[Aerenal]], and it is possible that he might ask adventurers to help resolve a situation involving the [[Emerald Claw]] or other [[undead]] menaces. 

Recently, Mayne Jhaelian has become engaged to the middle sibling of the [[ir'Tain family]], Cariana.
