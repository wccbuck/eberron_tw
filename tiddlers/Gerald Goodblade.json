        "text": "\"Lord\" Gerald Goodblade is nothing of the\nsort; his title is the result of his skill at lying about\nhimself. When visitors first arrive in [[Stormreach]],\nGerald’s “good name” is likely to be one of the first\nthings they hear about, thanks to his practice of\npaying off street urchins, beggars, and other poor\npeople to talk him up to new arrivals. He makes his\nliving fleecing newcomers, selling stolen goods, and\nsponsoring minor acts of theft and grave robbing.\nHis latest scam involves some nice-looking but poorly\nmade swords, which he tries to pass off as magical. He\noffers them as a reward to those willing to do some of\nhis “little tasks.”",
