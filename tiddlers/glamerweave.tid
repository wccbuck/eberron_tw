Glamerweave is a fine, light fabric that
has delicate illusions woven into its threads. The color of
glamerweave seems to shift subtly and is hard to describe,
but this property makes for a striking and strangely beautiful appearance. 

Glamerweave can cost anywhere from [[1 to 20c|money]], depending on the effect. Rarer and higher-quality glamerweave can have the pattern rise from the cloth. For example, a glamerweave gown might be wreathed in harmless, illusory flames, while a glamerweave hat might have illusory butterflies fluttering around it. 

One form of glamerweave, known as ''glimmersilk'', holds colors that are far more vivid than would be possible with normal cloth; a pattern of flames painted on glimmersilk actually seems to burn. Another, ''cloudsilk'', is almost weightless and has the appearance of diaphanous white mist (though one variation has the appearance of dark clouds laced with lightning; this variation is sometimes called ''stormsilk'').

The finest glamerweave is produced by the [[gnome]]s of [[Zilargo]] and the mage-tailors of [[Aundair]].
