Glamerweave is a fine, light fabric that
has delicate illusions woven into its threads. The color of
glamerweave seems to shift subtly and is hard to describe,
but this property makes for a striking and strangely beautiful appearance.

Rarer and higher-quality glamerweave can have the pattern rise
from the cloth. For example, a glamerweave gown might
be wreathed in harmless, illusory flames, while a glamerweave hat might have illusory butterflies fluttering around it.
