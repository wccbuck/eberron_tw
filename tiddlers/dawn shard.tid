title: dawn shard
tooltip: special Eberron dragonshard charged with the Silver Flame, found only in Q'barra; helps bind the overlord Masvirik
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A dawn shard is special variety of Eberron [[dragonshard]] found only in [[Q'barra]]. Dawn shards are pale orange with crimson threads, and possess remarkable magical qualities. They are worth five times as much as standard [[dragonshard]]s of similar size.

The miners of [[Q'barra]] have yet to discover the source of this unusual power. The truth is that dawn shards are charged with the divine power of the [[Silver Flame]]. As a result, using these dragonshards may result in unexpected effects. 

When planted in the earth throughout the jungle surrounding [[Haka'torvhak]], dawn shards form a "web of light" that helps bind the [[overlord]] [[Masvirik]], the Cold Sun. Together with the [[dusk shard]]s that sequester Masvirik's darkness, the Cold Sun remains bound.
