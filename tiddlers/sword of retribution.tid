This mighty sword makes wounds that [[magical healing]] cannot restore. Any [[harm]] dealt by this weapon must heal naturally or with the help of mundane medical care, and it resists any magical attempt to accelerate that healing.

This sword is [[cursed]] and possessed by a vengeful spirit. When you become [[attuned|attunement]] to this weapon, you become unwilling to part with it, and suffer [[disadvantage]] any time you make an attempt to attack using any other weapon.

The vengeful spirit possessing the sword shares its history and lust for vengeance with the wielder. During each extended period of rest, you experience nightmares of the spirit's past, culminating in its death. When you wake, you must make an attempt to withstand the horror of these nightmares, or else fill in your right-most [[stress]] box. 

Only the [[remove curse]] spell allows you to end [[attunement]] to this item.
