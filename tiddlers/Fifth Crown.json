        "text": "In the early days of the [[Last War]], [[Cyre]] relied on House [[Phiarlan]] to gather\nintelligence but knew that such an arrangement\nwith a [[dragonmarked house]] might not last. Over\nthe course of decades, Cyre began to develop its own spies, the agents of the Fifth Crown, who were trained to infiltrate enemy territory. In the wake of the [[Mourning]],\nthe fate of the Fifth Crown remains unknown. Most people assume the agency was obliterated with its headquarters, but there are conspiracy\ntheorists who say that agents of the Fifth Crown\nhave worked their way into secure positions\nacross the [[Five Nations]], and that they are simply\nwaiting for Prince [[Oargev|Oargev ir'Wynarn]] or another [[Cyran|Cyre]]\nleader to devise an effective way to use them. Until then, they might be the neighbors, postal carriers, teachers, or even community leaders, biding the time until such time leadership activates these pocket splinter cells.",
