Shadowspire is the capital of the [[Narathun]] [[clan|Mror clan]] of the [[Mror Holds]]. In the modern age, the [[dragonmarked house]]s and traditions of [[Galifar]] have brought [[magewright]]s to all holds. But its oracles are still respected, and the Ebon Library of
Shadowspire is the one of the finest schools of [[divination]]
in [[Khorvaire]]. Narathun sages have always asserted that no
knowledge should be forbidden, and Shadowspire holds
temples both to the [[Shadow]] and to the [[Blood of Vol]].

Sages of [[Clan|Mror clan]] [[Narathun]] have established a [[flumph]] sanctuary beneath Shadowspire and reunited a cloister. A group of Narathun [[bard]]s have been working with these flumphs to develop their [[thoughtsinging|thoughtsong]] techniques. The flumphs also willingly serve as sentinels, helping Narathun watch for [[Dyrrn]]â€™s forces.
