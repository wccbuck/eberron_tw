Tasker's Dream (named after legendary [[Sivis]] [[gnome]] [[Tasker Torralyn d'Sivis]]) is a House [[Sivis]] think tank dedicated to developing new forms of magical and
linguistic communication. In addition to working to
improve upon the [[sending]] ritual and the [[speaking stone]]s, Tasker’s Dream is exploring the potential of telepathy and even developing new languages.

These practical projects provide cover for the
true work of the unit. Tasker’s Dream is dedicated to
unlocking all secrets of linguistic magic, including
the [[Draconic Prophecy]] itself. The Wordsmiths of
Tasker’s Dream will pursue any lead that could shed
more light on the Prophecy, and are especially interested in Prophecy marks found etched into the earth.
A PC who has ties to House Sivis could be recruited
to help the Dream unlock the secrets of the Prophecy, or to undermine its work if the Dream’s plans go
beyond house interests.

[[Talia Torralyn d'Sivis]] is a prominent Wordsmith of Tasker's Dream.
