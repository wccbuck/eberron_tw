He has deathly white skin, and a thick scar runs from the corner of one gleaming red eye back past a pointed ear. He smiles, flashing sharp fangs. \"What have we here?\" He hisses, measuring you with a casual glance of his crimson gaze.//\n<<<\n\nThe [[cleric]] named Garrow is a commander of the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]], charged with the recovery of ancient artifacts. He is a [[changeling]] who prefers to mimic the form of a [[vampire]], both as a way to frighten opponents and because he hopes to one day become a true vampire in the service of [[Lady Illmarrow]]. He plays the role with terrifying believability, but he doesn't possess any of the abilities or weaknesses of a true [[vampire]]. \n\nBrother Garrow serves the [[Emerald Claw]]'s cause with religious fervor, a faith which has granted him a measure of [[divine magic]]. He is able to wield this power to cast the following spells: [[cure wounds]], [[detect magic]], [[guidance]], [[fog cloud]], [[ray of enfeeblement]], [[animate dead]], [[inflict wounds]], [[silence]], [[speak with dead]], and [[undead eyes]].",
