        "text": "This three-story fortress of polished marble in the [[Terrace]] ward marks the headquarters of the military order charged with the defense of the city of [[Io'lokar]]. Unlike its counterpart [[Union of the Spear]], the Shield is not an order of full-time troops but a citizen militia under the command of some two hundred career officers. In the absence of a soldier class or a standing army, the people of Io’lokar are an army unto themselves. The [[Vast]] is full of [[dragon]]s who would be pleased to see [[Io'lokar]] join [[Io'vakas]] in ruin. As a result, the [[Io'lokari]] begin military training at a young age. \n\nThough crime within Io’lokar is all but unheard of, officers of the Shield keep the peace alongside the [[Arnaaracaex]]. Mostly this means monitoring unauthorized use of the high-level magic that suffuses the city, from adolescent casters summoning epic monsters to\naccidental arcane conflagrations tearing through upscale neighborhoods. In emergencies, citizens and visitors to the city alike are called to service.",
