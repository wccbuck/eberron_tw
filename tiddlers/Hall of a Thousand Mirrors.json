The [[halfling]]s of the enclave maintain their distance from but are not overtly hostile to the [[dragonborn]], the [[Cyran|Cyre]] settlers, and the [[lizardfolk]]\nliving nearby. They are cautious about unexpected\nvisitors, however, because their enclave is built atop\nancient ruins that contain powerful magic.\n\nThe Hall of a Thousand Mirrors is accurately\nnamed. Below the stone and wood of the [[enclave]] is\na maze of corridors; a full-length mirror stands at\neach junction, making navigation difficult. For most,\nwalking through the Hall of a Thousand Mirrors is\nmerely unnerving. But those suffering from magical\ncurses or madness find that the mirrors somehow\ndisplay their afflictions\u2014and then their nightmares\nwalk out of the mirrors. If a cursed or maddened\nvisitor can somehow fight off the images and walk through the Hall of a Thousand Mirrors, then the last mirror shows a normal reflection, and sanity and\nnormal life return.", "modified": "20210727192012269", "tags": "enclave Q'barra Jorasco", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "article": "the ", "category": "location", "color": "#A3DB62", "points": "39.452,32.17", "style": "{\"color\": \"#732873\"}"}
