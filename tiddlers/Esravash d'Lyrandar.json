But what an elder sees as impetuous, a teenage Lyrandar sailor calls bold. Esravash is adored by the rank-and-file members of the [[Windwrights Guild]] in particular.\n\nEsravash’s immediate goal is to expand elemental [[airship]] service as much as possible, building docking towers in more cities and paying House [[Cannith]] and the [[gnome]]s of [[Zilargo]] for more elemental airships. To finance these plans, Esravash scrutinizes the house’s bottom line, and she doesn’t tolerate shipping losses.\n\nEsravash plans to stop losses to the pirates of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. [[Elemental galleon|elemental galleon]]s are now fitted with catapults, and House [[Lyrandar]]’s spies are busy following the rumors of experimental, magic naval weapons said to have been developed by [[Aundair]] and [[Karrnath]] near the end of the [[Last War]].",
