        "text": "A desert of black sand under a starless skyâ€”this is one of\n[[Mabar]]'s iconic images. In the Last Desert, there are remnants\nof glorious monuments: the half-buried head of a grand statue,\nits eye cracked; a fragment of a memorial wall, engraved\nwith names that can no longer be read; ruins so worn that it's\nimpossible to guess what purpose the building once served.\nCharacters knowledgeable in history and arcana can recognize\nthat these monuments are drawn from dramatically different\ncultures; some are the work of [[celestial]]s, while others might\nhave been created by the [[giant]]s of [[Xen'drik]].\n\nAt the center lies a massive tomb-palace. Its style suggests\nthe architecture of [[Aerenal]], but it's grander than even the [[City of the Dead|Shae Mordai]]. This is the fortress of the [[Queen of All Tears]], the [[Dark Power]] of this domain. \n\nThe Queen's layers are largely desolate and miserable,\nfilled with wailing [[wraith]]s and [[banshee]]s and wandering [[nightwalker]]s. One is a battlefield plucked from [[Aerenal]], where the bones of elves and dragons\nlie intertwined; this may hold the key to discovering her past.",
