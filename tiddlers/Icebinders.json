Their migrations do not correspond to any seasonal pattern, nor do they trail any of the great herding animals of the Tashana. Some have suggested that the Icebinders move according to some intricate plotting of the [[aukarak|reality storm]]s that\nsweep across the Tundra. Others say the Icebinders actually\ncontrol the aukaraks, somehow herding the storms like great\nplanar beasts. In any case, each nomadic Icebinder group\nis apparently self-governed and independent.",
