This talent counts as a level of [[Spellcaster|Spellcaster (talent)]].

Your pact with a powerful [[immortal]] grants you the ability to cast the spell [[summon familiar]]. You can also cast [[hold]], but instead of targeting [[humanoid]]s, your version of the spell can only target [[celestial]]s, [[fiend]]s, or [[elemental]]s.
