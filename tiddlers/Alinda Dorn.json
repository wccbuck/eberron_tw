        "text": "Alinda Dorn is the [[bone knight]] commander of [[Fort Bones]] in [[Karrnath]]. For the past eight years she has devoted\nherself to the destruction of the [[Valenar]], and she is\none of the foremost experts on their strategies and\ntactics. Her [[undead]] cavalry can't match the Valenar\nhorses for sheer speed, but her steeds never tire. She\nhas learned that force alone isn't enough to match\nthe Valenar, and she is an expert in games of cat and\nmouse; she is also a master of the game [[Conqueror]]\nand loves to play it with newcomers. \n\nAlinda despises the [[Emerald Claw]] with the same fervor as the Valenar, believing\nits adherents to be traitors that besmirch the name of\nthe [[Blood of Vol]]. She is deeply suspicious of [[Malevanor]] and\nthe [[Crimson Covenant]] of [[Atur]]. Along with the [[Kind]] of the [[Corpse Collectors]],\nshe believes that [[Fort Bones]] provides a vital opportunity to prove the loyalty of the [[Seekers|Blood of Vol]] and to place\ntheir unique skills in the service of the crown.
