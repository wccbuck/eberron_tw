This large, windowless building
near the top of Vasha Tower contains the nearly endless legal and historical records of [[Sharn]]. Copies of
birth records, marriage rolls, and death certificates
are kept in the archives, as well as property records,
copies of letters of marque, and records of identification papers issued in the city. Agents of the [[Citadel|King's Citadel]]
have unrestricted access to the records, and other
characters with contacts in the government or in a
[[dragonmarked house]] might be able to gain access to
a specific set of records for a single use by calling in
a favor.
