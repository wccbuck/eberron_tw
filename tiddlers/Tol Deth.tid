''Population:'' <<ntls>>

This [[Nulakesh]] bastion city of [[Riedra]] lies close to a [[wild zone]] linked to
[[Shavarath]]; the [[Inspired]] are studying the zone to find a
way to tap its energy and breed superior soldiers or war-beasts. If House [[Vadalis]] learns about this, PCs could be sent to see what the [[Riedrans]] have done. Alternatively,
a party of Riedran adventurers could be dispatched to
destroy an experiment gone horribly wrong.
