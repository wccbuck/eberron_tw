Dejarn is one of two remaining floating citadels of [[Breland]]. It has played a very different role than its much larger sibling, [[Argonth]], since the end of the [[Last War]]. The mission of Argonth
is relatively public and its route is well established, but
Dejarn moves about in secret, and its purpose is a mystery. Some say that it is a mobile citadel for the [[King's Citadel]], and the [[Dark Lanterns|King's Dark Lanterns]] in particular, used
to transport paramilitary troops, hold prisoners for
interrogation, and otherwise conduct operations out
of the public eye. Others suggest that House [[Cannith]]
purchased the fortress back from [[Breland]], and Baron
[[Merrix d'Cannith]] uses it for his own secret research.
A related theory holds that a renegade faction of House
Cannith has teamed with nobles and ofﬁcers of Breland
to develop new military technology that will guarantee
Breland’s superiority when war, inevitably, breaks out
afresh in [[Khorvaire]]. Those few who know the truth of
Dejarn’s mission are certainly not telling, but sightings
of the mysterious fortress always lead to new rumors.
