        "text": "Named for the light gray slate roofs on many of the buildings, [[Fairhaven]]'s Whiteroof\nWard handles much of the cityâ€™s river shipping. A\nrough-and-tumble part of town, Whiteroof is home to a large community of [[Khoravar|half-elf]] who descend from the earliest inhabitants of the city. Dressed flamboyantly in loose clothing reminiscent of [[Valaes Tairn]] dress, these quixotic, itinerant \"river elves\" are fishers, ferry folk, shippers, and even pirates on the [[Aundair River]]. River elves are vibrant and independent, and they are savvy and bold in business and other interpersonal dealings. Anyone who needs to move something in or out of [[Fairhaven]] without the notice\nof the authorities can turn to the river elves of Whiteroof. The half-elves also look to the protection of their kind, and they have a reputation for duping the\nunwary. \n\n!! Noteworthy Locations\n\n* ''The Hooked Inn''\n* ''The Tipsy Nixie'' (tavern)\n* ''Riverside Supply'' (shop)\n* The [[Underquay]]\n* [[Vorenn's Walk]]",
