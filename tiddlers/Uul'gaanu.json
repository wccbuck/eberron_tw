        "text": "The Uul’gaanu, or the “Daughters of the Dream,” are a secretive sect of the [[Shadow Marches]]. A benevolent cult, the Uul’gaanu build their communities around hidden [[flumph]]s with whom they have formed a symbiotic relationship, just as the [[Whisperers]] bond with [[gibbering mouther]]s. The flumphs help the Uul’gaanu develop basic [[telepathic abilities|psionics]]; an Uul’gaanu community has a very simple hive mind, with members of the community casually sharing emotions and thoughts. Community members gather together for psychic [[metaconcert]]s, generating shared emotions that feed their flumphs. \n\nDealing with the Uul’gaanu can be unsettling for outsiders, as the Uul’gaanu respond to the thoughts and emotions of their companions without need for speech; while for their part, the peaceful Uul’gaanu are often distressed by the cruel or selfish thoughts of outsiders. As a result, the Uul’gaanu tend to remain isolated from other Marcher communities.",
