Lizardfolk are tribal reptilian humanoids that inhabit the jungles and swamps of [[Q'barra]] and [[Xen'drik]]. Their race is as ancient as the [[giant]]s and the [[dragon]]s, having originated during the [[Age of Demons]]. The most common subspecies of lizardfolk, //tilsin//, are between 6 and 7 feet, weigh around 250 pounds, and have green, gray, or brown scales. They also have a 3-4 foot long tail, which they use for balance. They are expert swimmers and can hold their breath for well over ten minutes.

!! Lizardfolk of Q'barra

The vast majority of lizardfolk of the jungles of Q'barra are part of the Masvirik'Uala, or [[Cold Sun Federation]], though some have fallen to the corruption of [[Haka'torvhak]] and have joined the ranks of the [[Poison Dusk]]; many of these have been transformed by [[Masvirik]]'s power into hulking [[blackscale]]s. In their unique dialect of [[Draconic]], lizardfolk of [[Q'barra]] call their species "tsa," which is also their word for "we" or "us." 

The tsa are a primitive folk. They do not forge metal tools. They fashion their armor from
hides, and their weapons are made from wood, bone, and [[dragonshard]]s. Despite their primitive appearance, lizardfolk mystics are skilled at the art of enchanting weapons, so Masvirikâ€™Uala champions may have powerful magical weapons and dragonshard augments.
