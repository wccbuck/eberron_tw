The temples of Pinnacle serve more of a social function than a religious one. The primary duties of a Pinnacle priest are managing donations, ensuring that the people who pay the most get prominent seating during services, and performing formal (if ultimately meaningless) blessings at the parties and
galas of the wealthy. The one exception is the Temple
of [[Balinor]]; while it happens to have been built in
Pinnacle, its priests are dedicated and its services
draw the faithful from across [[Sharn]].
