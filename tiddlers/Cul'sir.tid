Cul'sir the Visionary was the mightiest [[titan]] of the [[Age of Giants]], and united the titans of [[Xen'drik]] into the single largest civilization of the age, the [[Cul'sir Dominion]]. Along with his unmatched [[arcane|arcane magic]] might, God-King was able to harness the power of [[Dal Quor]] to impose his own will on reality through conscious lucid dreaming. This reality-warping power was used to a lesser degree by the [[oneiromancers|oneiromancy]] and somnitects of the Dominion, but Cul'sir never shared the secrets of his complete mastery of dream magic, and suffered no rivals. Cul'sir performed incredible acts of epic magic in his millennia-spanning lifetime, including casting the [[feyspire]] of [[Shan Doresh|Taer Lian Doresh]] into the plane of [[Dal Quor]]. The Visionary sought to dominate [[Dal Quor]] and all other [[plane]]s, but the invasion of the [[quori]] halted his ambitions; Cul'sir eventually ended that conflict through the use of the [[Moon Breaker]] to destroy [[Eberron]]'s direct connection to the plane of dreams, an act which greatly diminished his own power and caused much of the oneiromantic infrastructure of the [[Cul'sir Dominion]] to collapse.

Cul'sir disappeared from history during the Shattering of [[Xen'drik]], when he attempted to use another act of world-breaking eldritch magic to annihilate the rebellious [[elves|elf]] and thus sparked the ire of the [[dragon]]s. The elves of [[Aerenal]] believe that the great hero [[Cardaen]], disciple of the Emperor himself, was responsible for striking him down. But Cul'sir may have found a way to flee his fate, plotting to return and dominate the world and the [[plane]]s in a future age. Perhaps he found a way to escape to [[Dal Quor]], knowing he could never return without help from the Material Plane. Or perhaps, in a desperate bid to gain vengeance on the [[dragon]]s and the [[elves|elf]], Cul'sir drew on the power of [[the Scar that Abides|Sakinnirot]], becoming an avatar of the [[overlord]] only to be sealed deep beneath his capitol of Cul'sirran (modern-day [[Stormreach]]).

Note: The term "Cul'sir" is often used to refer to the [[Cul'sir Dominion]] or its people, and is also sometimes used to indicate the [[Giant]] dialect that later influenced the [[Aerenese]] and [[Syrk]] languages.
