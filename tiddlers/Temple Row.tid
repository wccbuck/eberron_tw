A jumble of shrines and stalls selling devotional
knickknacks, Temple Row is a bazaar of religion in the [[Temple District]] of [[Stormreach]]. Most of the streetâ€™s priests, prophets, and charlatans make
appeals on behalf of the [[Sovereign Host]], but it is not
unusual for representatives of the [[Dark Six]] or even the
[[Dragon Below|Cults of the Dragon Below]] to preach among them.
