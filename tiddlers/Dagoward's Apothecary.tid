If you’re after [[healing potion|potion of healing]]s, antitoxins, or a healer’s kit in the Harbor district, you have one option: Dagoward’s Apothecary. Some say Nalia Dagoward has used underhanded methods to run competitors out of the district. Nalia’s prices are low, but you get what you pay for. She has enough beds for three people to get bed rest.
