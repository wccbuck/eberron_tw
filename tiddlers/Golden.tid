Golden is the [[Dominion|dominion]] of Greed in [[Syrania]]. She serves as a Talon of the [[Keeper]], making bargains on his behalf. She spends most of her time in the [[Immeasurable Market]], but occasionally comes to [[Eberron]] to negotiate an interesting dealâ€”whether of her own volition, or in service to the [[Lord of the Hoard|Keeper]], who she believes grants her divine guidance.
