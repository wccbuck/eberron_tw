Solia is in charge of [[Lyrandar]]’s affairs in [[Sharn]], overseeing operations of the [[Dragon Towers]] [[enclave|Lyrandar Enclave (Dragon Towers)]] and all smaller offices as well. Troubleshooting various shipping crises keeps her constantly en route from the elemental [[airship]] [[docking tower|Lyrandar Tower]] at the city’s pinnacle to the [[Cliffside]] docks at its base. Ever since it became known that Solia was considering new routes to [[Xen'drik]], every airship captain has been vying for her favor.
