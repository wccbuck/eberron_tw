title: mask of the pact bearer
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This mask looks like a normal wooden mask before a [[warlock]] dons it and attunes to it. When you attune to this mask, your otherworldly patron's lingering presence over you magically reshapes it to represent the visage of your patron. While you wear this mask, you can cast one spell from it from the list below that matches your patron. Once the mask has been used in this way, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
