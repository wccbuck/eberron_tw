        "text": "The ir'Tains are the most powerful family in [[Sharn]]. An ir'Tain served as the first [[Lord Mayor of Sharn]], and the first towers were raised with ir'Tain gold. Today the [[Khoravar|half-elf]] family derives most of its income from its vast holdings throughout the city; many of the tenements and apartment complexes are ir'Tain property. The Tain Manor in [[Brilliant|Skyway]] is only the latest in a long line of mansions to hold that name, and many of the former Tain Manors are now owned by the wealthiest citizens of other districts. \n\nDespite their wealth and power, the ir'Tains\nhave no connection to the [[Aurum]]. While the cabal\nhas approached members of the family, the ir'Tains\nfeel that an alliance with the Aurum would be an\ninsult to the pride and integrity of the clan. \n\n!! Prominent Members\n\n* [[Celyria ir'Tain]], matriarch of the [[Sharn]] branch\n* [[Hass ir'Tain]], Celyria's eldest son\n\nIn descending order of age, the other members\nof the core family are Cyra ir'Tain, Cariana ir'Tain (who has recently become engaged to [[Mayne Jhaelian]]), and Daral ir'Tain. Lord [[Dalian ir'Tain II]] is said to have perished in a shipwreck during the end of the [[Last War]].",
