Nathair Sgiathach (pronounced "nah-HAIR skee-HOKH", a name which means "The [[Dragon|dragon]]) is the most famous of [[faerie dragon]] folk heroes. Like other faerie dragons, Nathair adores jokes—even those made at the dragon's expense—which makes Nathair particularly popular among their [[pixie]], [[sprite]], and other [[fey]] associates. Though Nathair's magical powers are far greater than those of most [[faerie dragon]]s, they still prefer to resolve conflict with harmless pranks and absurdities, such as making an enemy's buttocks glow red and appear to sing folk tunes. When necessary, however, Nathair doesn't shy away from fighting to defend their beloved faerie folk. As such, some [[fey]]-touched creatures of [[Eberron]] teach their children to call Nathair Sgiathach's name in times of trouble, as well as to put out ceremonial offerings of the Dragon's favorite food: apple pie.
