This lock is imbued with the spell [[magic mouth]], and might resemble a face with the keyhole serving as the mouth. However, the lock does not come with a key. An attuned user can set a question and answer required to open the lockâ€”when the lock is touched, it will ask the set question, and it will open only if it is given the correct answer. Most users set a password, though some prefer to ask trivia questions, arcane knowledge, or other such things. The question and answer must each be 25 words or less; anything longer will be cut off. The lock speaks in its own voice, at a conversational volume. 

These locks can still be picked, but any attempt to do so cause the lock to scream, a terrible sound which ends only when the picker is out of sight or when the lock is successfully picked. This feature can be disabled by a person capable of disarming magical traps.
