This cult operates in major cities, usually\nrecruiting merchants, smugglers, and captains of industry. It is\nbased on the idea that while honest trade and industry form the\ncore of commerce, there should always be a way for people to\nget what they desire; thus, it is a neutral ground where criminals\nand guild artisans can work together. The [[Aurum]] often recruits\nmembers from the Three Faces of Coin.",
