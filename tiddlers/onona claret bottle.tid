If this bottle is filled with a couple of fluid ounces (about the volume of an egg) of the blood of a [[humanoid]], the blood transforms into wine after 1 minute. Whoever drinks this wine turns into a perfect likeness of the blood donor. The effect lasts for 24 hours, but can be ended early with the [[dispel magic]] spell. The bottle can hold 1 pint (0.5 liter).
