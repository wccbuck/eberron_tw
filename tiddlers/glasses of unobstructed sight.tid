This pair of glasses has large, circular lenses made from pink glass. When these glasses are worn, the user can see into and through solid matter out to a radius of 30 feet. To the wearer, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.
