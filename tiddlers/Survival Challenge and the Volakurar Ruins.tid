!!! Session 11

!!! Eyre

* [[Sejra Whitebinder]] tells Arien that an oath need not be such a sacrifice as long as it focuses one's faith. She says not everything needs to be a sacrifice; that's just a very [[Dol Arrah]] way of looking at the paladin's oath, but there are other paths.

* Leadership (Prior [[Hemdoth Aggan]])
** Case study: Leave No One Behind

<<<

One of the most difficult moral decisions of command is to what degree to uphold the code "Leave No One Behind". How many healthy soldiers will I risk to bring home one wounded (or dead) soldier?

You are in command of a platoon of soldiers, made up of five squads of eight soldiers. You are charged with a patrol mission along the edge of the [[Mournland]]. A thick fog rises, and you receive a report that one of your soldiers has gone missing. You send one of your squads to search for the missing soldier. Because of the thick fog, the squad and the main company will use bugles to communicate.

After one hour, the squad stops responding to bugle calls.

All of your soldiers are well trained, ready to go in an instant, and eager to find their missing companions. Do you send in another search squad? If you send them, what will you do if they too go missing? Do you instead cut your losses? Regardless of your choice, how will you explain your choice to the families of the missing? Every second counts.

Short mini-session. Went over classes: 2x ethics and leadership, 1x politics of khorvaire (Thrane). Also had the chat with Sejra.

* Leadership (Prior [[Hemdoth Aggan]])
** Case Study: Justice vs. Mercy.

<<<
You’re a commanding officer of a warship, and two soldiers have come to the captains mast for a non-judicial proceeding for the same offense. They were both on personal leave before the ship was scheduled to depart at 0800 on that particular morning. They were required to be aboard by 0700. However, they both took the same Orien carriage to the docks, which got stuck in traffic, and arrived at the pier 25 minutes after the ship departed. As captain, you have authority to decide their punishment.

The maximum punishment you can give at a non-judicial proceeding is:

* 45 days restriction (forbidden to leave the ship, extra duty after-hours)
* Forfeiture of ½ of one month’s pay for 3 months
* Reduction in rank one pay grade

The “standard” punishment for missing ship’s movement is:

* 30 days restriction
* Forfeiture of ½ of one month’s pay for 2 months
* If there was another mast offense in the last 12 months, reduction in rank

Profile of accused:

* Petty officer Barnaby: 24-year-old bachelor, known as a “wild man”. Has been to non-judicial proceedings twice in the last 3 years (charges of: disrespect towards a superior officer, and drunk and disorderly ashore). His division officer says he does a barely marginal job, and gets in trouble ashore frequently.
* Petty officer Goodman: 29 years old, married with 4 children, ages 1 month to 9 years. He has never been to captains mast. His division officer says he is extremely responsible and always does his job well. He also volunteers aboard ship tutoring sailors, and serves as the ship’s drug abuse counselor.

# What punishment do you give each sailor? Do you give them the same punishment, or different? Why?
# What were the considerations in your decision in order of priority?

!!! Wilderness survival challenge for Belmin's class

Survival class field trip final exam. Each student has a [[pop-up tent]], [[explorer's pack]], [[herbalism kit]], and [[healer's kit]]. Goal is to survive in the wilderness for one week, but are only give 3 days rations. 

Folks get in pairs and are assigned a section of wilderness they need to survive in for 7 days. Arien and [[Lorsanna]] get paired up. While they're out there, Lorsanna opens up a bit and tells Arien her story. 

It turns out, Belmin has made the environment harsher than normal to really test the students. So they have to face some [[stirge]]s, and an angry [[owlbear]]. (They kill the stirge swarm, and Arien lures the owlbear away using thaumaturgy, imitating a mating call.)

On day 5, Kupo the [[couatl]] indicates to Arien that something is going on in the woods. Turns out, a cult of the [[Grim King|Katashka]] is out here up to no good. They're rummaging around in an old [[Dhakaan]]i ruin, looking for a weapon of the [[Kech Nasaar]] that was deemed too horrifying even for them to use and sealed away millennia ago. A fragment of the Volakurar ("words of death") was said to be buried here, the secrets for creating an [[ulgurstasta]].

Dhakaani ruin warning brainstorming:

* “Tohiish Guur”: “Dangerous span”, “Dangerous ongoing”
* “Toh Gath'Kurar”: beware, undeath
* “Skiir Alkhuul”: run far away

And get this: the cult is led by the [[Prophet]]! Who was hanged for his crimes in [[Nelview]], but has come back as a fear eater [[ghast|ghoul]]. His real name is "Haris Vemodin". Other folks who are here:

* A finger keeper ghast (Arien has to contend with [[crawling claw]]s). Name this guy Filge, like the Age of Worms necromancer guy
* Another cultist named Balabar, a bald guy with a morningstar
* A [[goblin]] historian of some kind, named Kalaad
* Misc [[zombie]]s

The ruins are trapped in a way that causes the cult’s [[zombie]]s to turn on them. So Haris et al need a living creature to serve as fodder for any other traps in the ruins. If Arien and Lorsanna get captured, he might force them into this role. He had planned on using mindless undead, but some magical effect in the ruins keeps turning their undead against them.

There are also goblinoid skeletons here that raise up and attack intruders.

Got some ideas from here:

Turns out Arien had good rolls for stealthy eavesdropping, and the cultists didn't hear her or Lorsanna. The cultists decided to walk about an hour away to a small town nearby called Ten Pines, and snatch some people in the middle of the night and force them to go into the ruins for them. Arien and Lorsanna sneakily followed Haris, Filge, Balabar, Kalaad, and six zombies as they hiked through the woods; they took out two zombies, then Arien made a distraction with thaumaturgy as Lorsanna took Kalaad hostage. Haris tried to negotiate with Arien, saying he hadn't done anything illegal, and he could even show proof of ownership of the corpses he'd animated. She said "Ok, show me." He rummaged through his pack and pulled out a document, held it out to her as he approached... he was gonna try something sneaky, but Arien threw a [[produce flame]] at him. It ignited the papers but two [[crawling claw]]s started climbing up her legs. She ignited ([[Aasimar of Fernia]]). Meanwhile Lorsanna knocked out Kalaad and engaged Balabar in combat. Haris tried [[vampiric touch]] and also [[ray of enfeeblement]] but Arien kept dodging. Then she rushed towards him and just tried to clutch his vampiric touch hand and stamp it out. She took some harm from that, but suddenly the fire on her arm transformed into the cool bright [[Silver Flame]]. Kupo the couatl sent her a mental message that this flame was the binding flame, that it does not burn but is made to protect the innocent and bind ancient evils. So Arien decided to literally bind Haris, locking him in place with a rooted boulder nearby. What actually happened was, she created a magical tether between Haris's animating energy (an extension of the [[Grim King|Katashka]] and the earth, and if Haris walks too far away from the anchor point, his body starts to die. Also his right hand (which Arien silver flame'd) is fully dead.

Lorsanna killed Balabar and bound Filge, and the duo left Haris where he was and took Kalaad and Filge back to the camp. Two zombies still stood guard at the ruin entrance, but didn't attack because Arien & Lorsanna didn't try to enter the ruins (might retcon this; why wouldn't they be guarding the camp?). Kalaad filled them in on what this was all about. They rested there, and went through the cult's belongings in the morning, learned about the scheme. They found an [[adamantine]] key from the Dhakaani empire and let Kalaad keep that. They also let him go, and Lorsanna mentioned how unusual and amazing it was that Arien could directly pull from the Silver Flame without invoking the Voice (Tira Miron).
