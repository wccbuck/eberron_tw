Xephs are a strange breed native to [[Adar]] and
possibly a product of the peculiar planar forces that exist
in the land of refuge. Agile and psychically able, xephs
are renowned for their fine crafts. Their hair is usually
worn either short or shaved but for a single long braid. Adaran xephs seem
extremely lighthearted compared to the typical [[Adaran|Adarans]],
but the xeph homeland has never known war or significant internal strife. All xephs consider themselves soldiers in the defense of Adar, however, and they're worthy
partners in this role.

Xephs are human-like with a few notable differences: namely, a dark yellow freckled complexion, pointed ears, and among [[psionically-gifted|psionics]] xeph, eyes that glow bright green. Outsiders who encounter both xeph and [[gith]] may notice some similarities in the two species. Could it be possible that xeph are a hybrid of gith and [[human]]?

!!! Xeph Lands

Xephs originated and still live in rift
valleys in the southwestern portion of [[Adar]]. Their home
is a peaceful and concealed one in a cavernous canyon on
a river they name the [[Xaryai|Xaryai River]]. [[Xephanan]], their largest
city, is deep within the canyon.
