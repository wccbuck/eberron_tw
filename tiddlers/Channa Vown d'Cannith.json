Merrix dispatched one of his personal\nprotégés, an [[artificer]] named Channa of the Vown family, to take over the [[Stormreach]] facilities and replace the majority of the staff with people loyal to [[Cannith South]], displacing former Viceroy [[Toven d'Cannith]].\n\n[[Merrix|Merrix d'Cannith]] has directed Channa to focus resources on researching the [[warforged]], and [[Cannith]] expeditions are directed\ntoward finding [[docent]]s, [[quorcraft]] components, ancient\n[[creation forge]]s, or anything else that could further\nMerrix’s work in [[Sharn]].\n\nChanna is a devotee of the [[Traveler]].",
