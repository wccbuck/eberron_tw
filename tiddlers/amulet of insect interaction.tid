This amber pendant has a beautiful black beetle encased inside, and dangles from a brass chain. It allows the wearer to communicate fluently with insects and arachnids. Flies, spiders, ants, and other bugs will behave amicably towards the wearer, and are more likely to aid the wearer when called upon.
