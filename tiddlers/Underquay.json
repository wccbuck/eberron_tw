        "text": "While most legitimate river trade in [[Fairhaven]] operates through\nthe dockhouses of the [[Whiteroof Ward]], a select\nnumber of the city's underworld elite have a\nresource of their own. Flushed to the northeast edge\nof the wharf is a quay of cracked stone seemingly\nused for damaged ships. An unassuming dockhouse\nis perched on one corner and is accessed only by a\nsingle door inscribed with invisible runes of warding. Within lies the Underquay, a surprisingly large extradimensional space that serves as tavern, canteen, and customs house to the powerful and lawless. Those who try to report the Underquay find that some\nof the authorities have been paid off, and that their\ndays are now numbered.\n\nCharacters who learn the watchword of entry into the Underquay find themselves rubbing elbows with the worst of [[Fairhaven]]’s\ncriminal element. Here the gang lord [[Kreelo]] (in one\nof their many faces) might meet with corrupt officials,\ndisreputable visitors, or greedy merchants wishing\nto scare off their rivals. The war profiteer known as\n[[Dharvek]] often comes for business or to trade insults\nwith the rogues of [[K.N.I.V.E.S.]] Those who come looking\nfor trouble—or for a smuggler unafraid to break some\nbones—will find it in the Quay.",
