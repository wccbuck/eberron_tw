//When Eberron created life, she also created death. She gave the asp its venom and set plagues loose in the world. All these things have their purpose. Now you have pulled the serpentâ€™s teeth and leashed the plagues with magic. Our mother will not be mocked, and her wrath is coming soon.//

Forlorn is a [[druid]] of the [[Children of Winter]], the spiritual counterpart to [[Raven]]'s aggressive strength. He is withdrawn, emerging from seclusion only to proclaim his latest apocalyptic vision.
