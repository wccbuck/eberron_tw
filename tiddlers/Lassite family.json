        "text": "''Founder:'' [[Molou Lassite]].<br/>\n''Current Leader:'' [[Varen Lassite]].<br/>\n''Primary Sphere of Influence:'' Diplomacy and commerce.<br/>\n''Family Business:'' [[Molou's Distillery]].<br/>\n''Districts:'' [[Cross]], [[Marketplace]].<br/>\n''Allies:'' House [[Ghallanda]], House [[Tharashk]], [[Kirris Sel Shadra]].<br/>\n''Enemies:'' None.\n\nThe Lassites, with their [[kuryeva]] brewing traditions, had an easy transition to honest living as [[Storm Lords]]. The pirates used their considerable wealth to expand their brewing operations. Today [[Molou's Distillery]] is one of the largest employers in [[Stormreach]], and its [[kuryeva]] is popular across the [[Five Nations]]. The Lassite family was set in charge of the [[Marketplace]], and the Lassites work to settle disputes between merchants and to smooth the wheels of commerce. Traditionally, the Lassites are the diplomats of [[Stormreach]]. When foreign dignitaries need to be entertained or the interests of Stormreach need to be taken abroad, the Lassites are brought into play.\n\nThe family’s current head is [[Varen Lassite]], a handsome man just reaching his middle years. His uncle, [[Volen Lassite]], was the former Lassite [[Storm Lord|Storm Lords]], but now manages [[Molou's Distillery]]. Varen's daughter [[Naleen|Naleen Lassite]] is the heir apparent.\n\nThe Lassites have few enemies, having chosen to\navoid direct conflict with the other lords; given this\nneutrality, they serve as mediators in times of crisis.\nThey also have a number of powerful allies. Over the\nyears they have established a solid bond with House\n[[Tharashk]], helping to meet the house’s needs in [[Cross]].\nThe Lassites also have a strong relationship with House\n[[Ghallanda]]. Although the [[halfling]]s maintain a minimal presence in [[Stormreach]], the [[kuryeva]] trade forms a connection between the two that extends across the [[Thunder Sea]]. Finally, while the Lassites are on good terms with all the [[Storm Lords]], Lord Varen has established a close friendship with Lady [[Kirris Sel Shadra]],\nand the two act to support each other.",
