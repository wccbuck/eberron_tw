You extend your hand and point a finger at a target within 30 feet. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target's defenses, revealing specific weaknesses. Within the next 30 seconds, you gain an [[advantage]] on your first attempt to attack the target. The new information gained from this divination can be used to justify higher [[impact]] or lower [[risk]] for as long as the information is relevant.
