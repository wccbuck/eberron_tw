You extend your hand and point a finger at a target within 30 feet. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target's defenses, revealing specific weaknesses. Within the next 30 seconds, you gain an [[advantage]] on your first attempt to attack the target. The new information gained from this divination can be used to justify higher [[impact]] or lower [[risk]] for as long as the information is relevant.

!! Common-Tier

When you cast //{{!!title}}// as a common-[[tier|spell tier]] spell, you do not suffer [[disadvantage]] or other penalty for striking your target behind partial cover, and you can choose another creature within 30 feet to receive this spell's benefits in addition to yourself.
