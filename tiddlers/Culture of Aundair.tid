type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

From the nobles lounging in the towers of [[Fairhaven]] to the common folk working the vast vineyards of [[Bluevine]], [[Aundair]]ians value wit and wisdom. Aundairians prefer finesse to brute force and appreciate cunning wordplay and fine fashions. [[Arcane magic|arcane magic]] is also deeply ingrained in Aundairian culture; a [[cleansing stone]] graces every village, and one might encounter animated farming equipment in the fields. The [[nobility of Aundair|Nobility of the Five Nations]] will often use a title that describes their most accomplished [[school of magic|spell school]]; a noble might be introduced as a "[[Diviner|divination]] of the Fourth Circle."

Many outsiders consider [[Aundair]]ians to be fiercely competitive, almost arrogant in their willingness to display their verbal, martial, and intellectual skill. A clever commoner would instead say that an Aundairian learns from an early age to stand their ground. Those who grow up in the country with many siblings quickly learn to deal with competition. Any Aundairian who’s worked an afternoon in a trading village’s marketplace knows that making a living depends on making your opinions well known.

This doesn’t mean that an [[Aundair]]ian responds to any disagreement by being stubborn; quite the opposite. Aundairians know that if they can’t settle something with a quick test of wits, a simple verbal duel to “first blood,” or a clever quip, their neighbors are “resolute” enough to hold a grudge for a long time. Bad feelings can easily escalate into a more dangerous conflict. The violent duels of [[Passage]] are known far and wide; the dueling crossbow known as the [[Passage Pistol]] is named after the city, and several Aundairian [[arcane order]]s cater specifically to [[wandslinger]] duelists. The [[Treaty of Thronehold]] outlawed all duels to the death two years ago, but lethal duels still commonly occur throughout Aundair. And while Queen [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]] has signed a law outlawing even non-lethal duels over matters of honor, technically this law only applies to sword duels.

Aundairians walk a careful balance between pragmatism and idealism. Even common folk feel a responsibility to stand up for what is right. Its citizens are ambitious without being foolhardy. They know that the nation has skilled soldiers and [[wizard]]s to resolve problems they cannot handle, but if no heroes are around to aid them, they will tackle the problem as best they can.

Aundair is also known for its traditional musical folk tales; see [[add-a-verse]] and [[Epic of Valiant and Vigilant]].

!! Fashion

The [[Aundair]]ian taste for elegance and sophistication
extend to the fashions worn in cities such as [[Fairhaven]]
and [[Passage]], where frilled [[glimmersilk|glamerweave]] combines with
ornately decorated cloaks and jackets to adorn the rich
and powerful. Those of more modest means attempt
to duplicate these styles as best they can, typically using lower-quality [[glamerweave]]. Men and women in the cities and larger towns wear elegant party gloves in public, a style that began as an accoutrement to fashions worn for a night on the town but have become the common practice. [[Cosmetic transmutation|cosmetic transmutation]] is also common; metallic hair colors are a recent fad in [[Fairhaven]].

The simpler folk, including common laborers and farmers, wear simpler garb. Everyday clothes for both men and women include the bard-style tunic, a pull-over shirt with a V-cut neck and flared sleeves, durable cotton pants, and sturdy leather boots. Most men try to have at least one set of “best clothes,” an outfit suitable for wear to a town gathering, a special function, or holiday party. Women keep a simple dress and an elegant dress (made of [[glamerweave]] if they can afford it) for the same purposes.

!!! Armor

Magic is part of daily life in the [[Five Nations]], and this
is never truer than in [[Aundair]]. Aundairians often use
[[glamerweave]] or [[transmutation|cosmetic transmutation]] to add flair to both
clothing and armor, and an Aundairian knight could
have twinkling stars or brooding storm clouds imbued
into their armor. With that said, Aundairians favor grace,
mobility, and skill over heavy armor and brute strength.
The Aundairian [[wandslinger]]—lightly armored, fashionably dressed, wielding [[wand]] and rapier—is celebrated over the heavily armored knight.

!! Cuisine

[[Aundair]]ian cuisine features a cacophony of ingredients that their classically trained chefs turn into a symphony of taste and texture. Aundairian meals consist of small portions presented in elegant fashion, each plate a beauty to behold and a wonder to savor. Sauces play a heavy role in any recipe, and the cuisine of this nation is considered to be exquisitely rich and suitable for special occasions. [[Selas leaves|selas leaves]] are a sweet and aromatic herb often found in the cuisine of Aundair, particularly used with red meat dishes. Pan-seared rabbit with an Aundairian wood-nut sauce, gold pheasant stuffed with sparkle mushrooms and rice, and dragon salmon in butter and dark wine sauce are particular favorites that have begun appearing in House [[Ghallanda]] inns throughout the [[Five Nations]]. 

This region also has a reputation for its premier vineyards, and the wines of Aundair are considered among the finest in all of Khorvaire. Some of the best recent vintages now being traded in markets across the land include fireburst wine from the vineyards of [[Arcanix]], dark Orla-un wine known for its fruity sweetness, dry [[Iltrayan]] said to "ready the blood for battle," and [[Windshire rainbow wine]], a type of mursi (red wine) that changes color and flavor as one consumes a glass.

Finally, Aundairian pastries and sweets reveal a level of artistic and culinary sophistication unmatched throughout the [[Five Nations]]. From tarts to cremfels (thin, fruit-and-cream-filled pancakes), the desserts that originated in this region combine elegance with artistry that reveals at least a portion of the Aundairian spirit.

!! Religion

The [[Sovereign Host]] is the dominant faith of [[Aundair]], with a particular devotion to [[Aureon]]. However, the [[Silver Flame]] also maintains a devoted following—some might say overzealous. See [[Pure Flame]] for more information.
