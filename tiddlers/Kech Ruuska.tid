! Keepers of the Tiger

[[Beast|beast]]s served many important roles in the Empire of [[Dhakaan]].
The Ruuska dar fill much the same role that House [[Vadalis]] does
for the [[Five Nations]]: tending and training the many beasts of the
empire, while always searching for—or creating—new beasts to
fill a need. //Ruuska// is the [[Dhakaani]] word for “tiger,” and tigers and
dire tigers are often used as cavalry in the vanguard of Dhakaani
armies. But the Kech Ruuska breed all manner of beasts, from
fierce guardians to clever messengers and simple livestock.

Just as there are soldiers in every kech, there are tenders
in every vault who maintain the [[beast]]s of that vault. However,
the Kech Ruuska specialize in breeding and training them,
producing the finest beast masters, and keeping the
widest range of exotic creatures in their arsenals. The Ruuska
also work with [[magebreeding]] and may have produced entirely
new [[beast]]s or [[monstrosities|monstrosity]] previously unknown on the
surface. While the Ruuska don't have a spiritual bond to the
natural world, they might have developed a form of [[druid]], serving as a specialist in assuming animal forms and controlling beasts. The Ruuska have also experimented
with [[therianthropy|therianthrope]]. It's up to the GM to decide if they were able
to control and weaponize the curse, if their efforts ultimately
came to nothing, or if therianthropy has spread throughout the
Ruuska—a secret they are concealing from the other clans.

The Kech Ruuska are led by the Beast Master warlord Lhaar
Dhakaan and the [[dirge singer]] Oruul. The [[Kech Shaarat]] are
putting considerable pressure on the Ruuska to support their
claim to the crown. It remains to be seen if Lhaar bows to these
threats, or whether the Ruuska seek an alliance that lets them
turn the tables on the powerful Shaarat.

The Kech Ruuska are a good option for a [[Dhakaan|Heirs of Dhakaan]]i ranger.
The clan can also be an interesting way to add new or exotic
beasts or monstrosities into the world, and could be an
intriguing foil for a storyline involving House [[Vadalis]].
