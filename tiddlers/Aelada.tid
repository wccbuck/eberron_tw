Aelada is the oldest [[sign language]] that is still in use today. It is employed by both the [[Aereni]] and the [[Tairnadal]], as well as the [[Bloodsail|Bloodsails]] [[elves|elf]] of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. The language is quite complex, but it shares some similarities with the simpler [[Sivis sign language]].
