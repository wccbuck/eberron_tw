This clear fluid is a powerful aphrodisiac, offered as an option at [[Firelight]] and
bordellos of similar quality. It primarily enhances sensation, but it also leaves the user vulnerable to seduction. For three hours after using heartflow, a character is more susceptible to [[charm]], [[suggestion]], or other mind-altering effects that inspire love or trust, even non-magical deceptions.
