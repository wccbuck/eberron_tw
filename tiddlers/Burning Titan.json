The titan represents the [[ancient|Age of Giants]] kings of [[Xen'drik]], who were burned away in [[dragon]]fire. The building of the titan takes six days and is itself a time of great revelry. Most of [[Forgelight]]’s workers get the entire week off to help, House [[Phiarlan]] supplies entertainment around the clock, and\ndozens of casks of gin are consumed by the builders.\nThe titan is set aflame at sundown on Therendor 1, and\nan all-night celebration of wild dancing and drinking\nensues, with many revelers wearing dragon masks. The\n[[giants of Rushemé|Guardians of Rushemé]] find the festival a distasteful display\nbut shoulder the unintentional insult graciously.",
