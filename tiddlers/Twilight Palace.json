        "text": "A joint venture of House [[Phiarlan]] and House [[Ghallanda]], the Twilight Palace in [[Graywall]] is a wondrous thing to find in such a savage land. Designed to serve the needs of the wealthy expatriate or the successful merchant, the palace is a grand hostel, with luxurious accommodations and courteous staff well-versed in the customs of every nation in [[Khorvaire]]. Within its walls, a visitor can easily forget\nthey are in [[Droaam]]. [[Phiarlan]] minstrels perform works from the golden age of [[Galifar]], and the [[Ghallanda]] chefs produce culinary delights to stir even jaded appetites. Thanks to [[Kundarak]] security, the Palace is as safe as [[Xorchylic]]â€™s fortress. Of course, such luxury comes at a heavy price.",
