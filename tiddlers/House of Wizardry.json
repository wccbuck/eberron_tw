Every nook and cranny hosts a [[magewright]] or minor [[wizard]]. More an indoor market than a shop, the sellers often find themselves competing\nwith one another. The selection of spells available on\nany given day is up to the GM, but can include cantrips or [[common-tier|spell tier]] [[spell]]s.",
