Using a combination of magic, [[alchemy|alchemist]], herbalism (see [[milian tea]]), and conventional medicine, members of the Healers Guild will treat anyone who can pay for\nthe privilege. Healers Guild facilities can be found in\nalmost any town across [[Khorvaire]].\n\nMost members of the Healers Guild are accomplished at healing but don’t concern themselves overmuch with house politics or the [[Draconic Prophecy]]. But because every [[Jorasco]] from Baron [[Ulara|Ulara d'Jorasco]] on down must devote at least a few days a year to assisting the Healers Guild, PCs convalescing in a guild hospital might come into contact with influential members of the house.",
