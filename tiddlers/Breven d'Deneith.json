        "text": "The baron of House [[Deneith]], Breven commands the\nlargest army remaining after the end of the [[Last War]],\nbut heâ€™s not inclined to use it for his own ends. He\nis surrounded by aggressive advisors, however, who\nwould like to see a Deneith sitting on the throne at\n[[Thronehold]]. \n\nThe baron is aware of this movement, but calls it madness. Taking the throne\nand setting House [[Deneith]] to rule [[Khorvaire]] would necessitate throwing away everything the house has built and stands for, and pit them against not just the [[Five Nations]] but the other [[dragonmarked house]]s. In addition, Breven is aware of the existence of the [[Chamber]] and the possible relevance of the [[dragonmark]]s to the [[Draconic Prophecy]], and so fears upsetting the balance and drawing the ire of the [[dragon]]s.",
