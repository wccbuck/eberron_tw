This island city at the mouth of [[Scions Sound]] has been the seat of House [[Lyrandar]] for 600 years, and Queen [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]] allows the house a free rein in governing the isle. It is Lyrandar's largest [[enclave]], as well as the finest resort and vacation spot in [[Khorvaire]]. [[Lyrandar]] [[wizard]]s use magic to continuously alter
Stormhome's weather, turning the otherwise bleak and storm-blasted location into a temperate island getaway. 

In the final years of the [[Last War]], Stormhome was a neutral meeting place for spies and power brokers from all sides. After the war, House [[Ghallanda]] constructed several luxurious inns, making the island a popular holiday destination for the wealthy. The
island is more than a vacation destination, however. Large dry docks repair and maintain [[Lyrandar]]’s [[elemental galleon]]s and its fleet of elemental [[airship]]s. One of the oldest buildings on the island, Slate Keep, is where young members of House Lyrandar learn seacraft.

Stormhome remains part of [[Aundair]] but is left to
its own devices, making it an ideal retreat for foreign
dignitaries and nobles. Even Queen [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]] seems
enchanted with the place, spending a portion of each year in the company of Lyrandar’s [[baron|Esravash d'Lyrandar]], swapping secrets and rumors to the dismay of both their advisors. As the premier destination for the wealthy and powerful, Stormhome has emerged as a hotbed of intrigue, and agents come to broker alliances and
gather intelligence about their rivals.

!! Stillstone Holt

With the [[Dreaming Dark]] scheming in [[Aundair]] over the course of the [[Last War]], the northern [[kalashtar]] felt they had to establish a presence in Stormhome, a hotbed of intrigue and espionage. Several decades ago, kalashtar elders purchased a number of rundown warehouses on the waterfront, which evolved over the years into the community of Stillstone Holt. While it appears to be a poor community of fisherfolk and shipwrights, it includes a significant number of gifted [[psion]]s. 

Stillstone Holt is led by the elders Kanashtai and Deratath. The [[kalashtar]] Halazerai leads a small division of [[soulknives|soulknife]] trained for urban combat that are tasked with defending Stillstone Holt. The community's religious leader is a [[cleric]] of the [[Path of Light]] named Dolarhad.
