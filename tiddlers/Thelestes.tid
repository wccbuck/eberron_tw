Thelestes wields powers far beyond those of her sister [[succubi|incubus/succubus]]. She came to [[Eberron]] twenty thousand years ago, fleeing a bitter feud with one of the [[Dark Power]]s of [[Mabar]] and their circle of [[ultroloth]]s, and once the [[overlord]]s are freed, she intends to wreak her revenge on the realm of darkness. Her first loyalty is to [[Eldrantulku]] the Oathbreaker and his [[prakhutu]] [[Kashtarhak]], but Thelestes might lend her skills to the schemes of any of the councilors of the [[Lords of Dust]]. She also maintains identities in House [[Phiarlan]], House [[Thuranni]], and many criminal organizations throughout the world, as she takes pleasure in watching mortal corruption and death.
