This potion flask contains a single, small, alchemically-enhanced beetle. After it is released from the flask, the bug moves at a speed of 1 mph to a point you specify. When it reaches that point, or after 1 minute passes, or if it suffers any damage, the beetle explodes into a 20-foot-diameter circle of grasping tendrils, as the spell [[entangle]]. The tendrils persist for up to 1 minute.
