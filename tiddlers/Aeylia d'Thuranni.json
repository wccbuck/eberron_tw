        "text": "Lady Aeylia dâ€™Thuranni is renowned among the [[Thuranni]], but her family can ill afford to publicly boast of her accomplishments. By day, she is the consummate courtier, touring the cities of [[Khorvaire]] as a representative of both family and house. Her artistry is the transformation of image through cosmetics, and [[dragonmark]]ed women of nearly every [[house|dragonmarked house]] seek her out. By night, Aeylia is one of the most accomplished and heralded assassins in her house, and she has used her mastery of disguise to root out members of the [[Bloody Shadows]] and other forces hostile to her house.\n\nA party of player characters might cross paths with Lady Aeylia at a house gala or other event. She travels almost constantly, often traveling a circuit that winds its way through all [[Five Nations]]. Alternatively, PCs could run into her on active assignment, most likely while she is in disguise.",
