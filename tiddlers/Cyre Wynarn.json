        "text": "Cyre Wynarn was the middle child of King [[Galifar I|Galifar Wynarn]], born a mere minute after their twin sister, [[Aundair|Aundair Wynarn]]. When the Kingdom of [[Galifar]] was formed, the king granted Cyre the role of governor-princess over the domain of [[Metrol]], the area later known as [[Cyre]] (and today known as the [[Mournland]]). By the time the king abdicated in 40 YK, Cyre was his only surviving scion, and became the second ruler of [[Galifar]]. They were succeeded by their son, Galifar II, known as [[Galifar the Dark]].\n\nCasual students of history may be confused by the contradictory accounts of the namesake of Cyre. In some accounts Cyre Wynarn was [[Galifar|Galifar Wynarn]]'s daughter, twin to [[Aundair Wynarn]]. In others, Cyre is described as Galifar's youngest son, who ruled as king after his father stepped down. Both accounts are true; as Princess Cyre, her vision of unity shaped her father’s kingdom, and as King Cyre, he ascended to his throne.\n\nGalifar's twins, [[Aundair|Aundair Wynarn]] and Cyre, were the most mystically gifted of the [[Wynarns|Wynarn family]]. Aundair specialized in [[evocation]] and [[conjuration]], while Cyre was devoted to [[divination]], [[illusion]], and [[transmutation]]. Their interest was always in understanding the true nature of a thing, and exploring the ways it could be expressed. Where Aundair was bold and often reckless, Cyre was thoughtful and empathetic. The [[Cyran|Cyre]] national motto is \"//What our dreams imagine, our hands create//\"—and this was Cyre Wynarn's motto long before it was the [[nation's|Cyre]]. They sought to understand the people of the [[Five Nations]], and it was Cyre's vision of all five working together—of harnessing the best in all of them—that drove both the development of the nation and the foundation of the united kingdom of [[Galifar]]. \n\nCyre's mastery of [[transmutation]] was unprecedented in the [[Five Nations]]. Their greatest creation was //Cyre's Mantle//, which used principles of transmutation and [[divination]] both to alter the form of the wearer and imbue them with new knowledge. Cyre didn't use the Mantle as a disguise, but to create unique personas reflecting different aspects of their identity. Their subjects grew used to \"the Five Faces of Cyre,\" and Cyre considered each face to be as much their true nature as the one they were born with. Few who knew Cyre were surprised that they chose to rule as King Cyre; this face's confident, decisive persona embodied his strongest leadership qualities. After his coronation, Cyre used the Mantle less often; he wanted the people to have a clear and consistent image of him as king, and only used other personas in private or with close advisors. \n\nThose who are familiar with [[changeling]] cultures may recognize elements of [[Traveler]] philosophy in Cyre's use of personas. While the truth is buried beneath centuries, some tales relate Cyre's great respect for the [[Children of Jes]] as he helped them establish havens across the united kingdom. In some of these tales, Cyre didn't actually create Cyre's Mantle, but received it as a gift from the [[Traveler]]. Whatever the truth, both Cyre's Mantle and some of his advisors disappeared after the king's natural death; various legends tell of the Mantle being used at various points in history, but its current location remains a mystery.
