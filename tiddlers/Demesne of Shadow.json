        "text": "The Demesne of Shadow, originally located in\n[[Metrol]], the one-time capital of [[Cyre]], was reestablished\nin [[Sharn]] following the Day of [[Mourning]]. This [[Phiarlan]] [[demesne|Demesnes]]\nteaches the arts of [[illusion]]. Deceptive magics are a powerful tool\nin the field of entertainment, and the Demesne\nof Shadow helps those who can wield these\npowers perfect their techniques. In addition to\n[[bard]]s, [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s can be found at\nthe Demesne of Shadow honing their illusionist\naspirations. While magic is typically the focus,\nthe demesne also teaches the verbal arts of\ndeception and coercion, of feigning emotion and\nplaying a role. Actors and orators learn their\ncraft at this Demesne, but these techniques can\nalso be useful to diplomats and spies. A storyteller learns his\ntales at the [[Demesne of Memory]], but at the Demesne of\nShadow he learns how to bring them to life.\n\nThe Demesne of Shadow is led by House Baron [[Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan]].",
