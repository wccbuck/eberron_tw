type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

These robes are spun from special magic-sensitive threads, causing arcane patterns to appear on the robe while you wear it whenever you cast a [[spell]]. While wearing these robes and no other armor, you are always under the effect of the [[mage armor]] spell. In addition, whenever you cast a spell of uncommon or higher [[spell tier]], you can change the style, color, and apparent material of the robe. Regardless of its appearance, it is always a robe and its weight remains the same.
