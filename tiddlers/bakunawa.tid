type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Worshiped as draconic avatars of storm and tide, bakunawa soar over the [[Hailana Islands]] and [[Aventus Islands]] they call home. Iridescent scales crackling with lightning cover a bakunawa's fearsome serpentine body, and the sharp movements of its mighty wings echo with thunderous winds. Known for their mercilessness in battle, bakunawa swallow whole any who challenge them.

In ages past, bakunawa served as mediators and defenders of the islands, but agents of [[Riedra]] have hunted the creatures for centuries, drastically reducing their numbers. Less than five are believed to exist, though more may be hibernating in hidden lairs.
