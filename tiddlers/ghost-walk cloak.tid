type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This shimmering, semi-translucent cloak is made of a mysterious lightweight material. Once per day, the user can use the cloak's magic to assume a spectral form for up to one hour. The user becomes incorporeal, and cannot interact with the material world. They can pass through walls and cannot be seen by most living creatures, though some can sense their cold presence.
