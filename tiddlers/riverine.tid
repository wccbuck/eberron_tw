More than mere waterway guardians, riverines are embodiments of particular rivers. These spirits of nature take shape to defend their waters and interact with those who travel along their currents. They might be considered a cross between a river [[nymph]] and a [[marid]].

From the waist up, riverines have skin the color of the waters they protect, but are otherwise humanlike in appearance. From the waist down, they can manifest either humanlike legs or churning gouts of water. A riverine's personality reflects the nature of the river it arises fromâ€”some are lethargic, while others are wild and reckless.

Riverines have innate magic which allows them to [[control water]] and create [[fog cloud]]s, as well as create sudden rainstorms. They can also cast the spell [[restoration]].

Some riverines enjoy reverence akin to worship. Their likenesses are cast as statues and housed in temples, and worshipers act as agents between the river spirits and the people who revere them. The riverine could choose to lair within that temple, though they may prefer other nexuses of power along the river's path, such as its source or a significant waterfall.
