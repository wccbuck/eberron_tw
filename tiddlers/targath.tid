Targath is a soft metal mined on the northern coast of [[Argonnessen]] and the [[Seren]] Islands, and is closely guarded by the Seren barbarian tribes. The metal possesses some natural salubrious properties, granting creatures resistance against non-magical diseases. It is also mysteriously effective against the [[deathless]] elves of [[Aerenal]], who shrink from its touch.
