title: cratering quarterstaff
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This thick, stony quarterstaff is extremely heavy and unwieldy. Despite glowing with embers, it feels comfortably warm to the touch.

When you swing this staff in an arc and slam it into the ground, you can create a 10-foot cone of intense tremors and flame, leaving a burning crater.
