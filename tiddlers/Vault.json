While there were reserves hidden around the kingdom,\nthe Vault included both the mint, Cyre’s primary reserves\nof currencies and precious metals, and important cultural\nartifacts deemed too valuable to be displayed. Salvagers have\ndreamed of finding this “Golden Palace,” but there are some\nstories saying that the Vault no longer remains where it was\nbuilt, but is actually //missing//. The [[Mourning]] had strange effects\non Metrol, and it’s possible the Vault was simply physically\ndisplaced, or it could have fallen into another [[plane]].",
