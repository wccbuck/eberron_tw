This wrought-iron lantern holds a small [[fire elemental]] spirit. To [[attune|attunement]] to this item, you must first persuade the elemental to bond with you, using the [[primal magic]] techniques of the [[Lorghalan]] [[gnome]]s.

While [[attuned|attunement]] to the lantern, you can verbally ask the [[elemental]] to glow, causing the lantern to cast bright light in a radius of your choice up to 60 feet and dim light for the same distance beyond that. You can also cast the [[produce flame]] spell from the lantern at will.

In addition, the [[fire elemental]] in the lantern can temporarily grant you a small fragment of its power. You can gain one of the following benefits of your choice for 1 hour:

* You have resistance to [[fire damage|damage type]].
* Whenever a creature hits you at close range, that creature suffers some fire damage.
* You can cast the [[burning hands]] spell. Once you cast the spell, you can’t do so again until the next time you use this property of the lantern.

Once the elemental has shared its power with you in this way, it can’t do so again until the next dawn.

''//Willful Attunement.//'' Your [[attunement]] to the
lantern lasts until you choose to end it, or until you
anger the [[elemental]] (by dousing the lantern in water,
attacking another nonhostile elemental being, and so
forth). You can attempt to attune to the lantern again
and try to persuade the spirit to bond with you, but you have [[disadvantage]] until you have made amends to the spirit, as the GM determines.
