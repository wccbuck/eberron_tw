And scattered across the\nrealm, there are countless shipsâ€”vessels pulled from the\noceans of [[Eberron]] in moments when the moons were right\nand [[Risia]] was coterminous. Some are shattered or wrecked,\ncaught halfway through the process of sinking. Others are\nin perfect condition, frozen under the thinnest layer of ice.\nShips from throughout history can be found here, [[Lyrandar]]\n[[elemental galleon]]s alongside massive ships built by the\nancient [[giant]]s of [[Xen'drik]]. There could be age-old survivors\nhere, sheltering in their trapped vessels, or a [[frost giant]]\nmight have raised a tower of ice above the frozen water.\nBut the spirits are strong here as well, preying on survivors\nand pulling them down into the frozen depths.\n\nIt's always night on the Frozen Sea; the moon [[Dravago]] is\nfixed in the cloudless sky, shedding dim light on the water.",
