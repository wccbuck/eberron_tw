type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You conjure up a wave of water that crashes down on an area within 120 feet. The area can be up to 30 feet long, up to 10 feet wide, and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area is struck by the wave and may be knocked prone. The water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in its area and within 30 feet of it, and then it vanishes.
