In some places, armies that were fighting on\nthe Day of Mourning became stone statues anchored in\nposition. Others were crystallized or reduced to ash.\n\nOn the Field of Ruins—around the Saerun Road in the\nsouthwest part of the [[Mournland]], where allied forces\nof [[Thrane]] and [[Breland]] battled an outnumbered Cyran\narmy on the Day of [[Mourning]]—the fallen soldiers are\npreserved just as they fell, with no sign of rot or decay.\nThousands upon thousands of corpses lie scattered\nacross the field, facedown in the dirt or staring lifelessly\nat the gray sky. Even seasoned bands of treasure hunters are loath to enter the Field of Ruins. \n\nThe Field of Ruins is the only known source of [[mournlode]], a newly-discovered ore that is particularly harmful against [[Mabar]]an [[undead]].",
