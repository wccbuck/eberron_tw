Stormreach is humanity’s greatest outpost on the continent of [[Xen'drik]]. Established by pirates and smugglers, it has become a vital resource for those who wish to explore or exploit the shattered land. Although the [[culture of Stormreach|Culture of Stormreach]] has its roots in [[Khorvaire]], it is a free city with no allegiance to any of the [[Five Nations]]. As such, Stormreach is a haven for explorers and exiles, for adventurers and criminals, for soldiers disillusioned with their former kingdoms and those who wish to continue the war. It is a beacon for dissidents and romantics, for fugitives on the run and those who need to escape their own memories. Far smaller than [[Sharn]], it is a city where a few bold adventurers can make a difference—a place where the major players quickly come to know each other.

Stormreach is far more than a gateway to Xen’drik. The [[history of the city|History of Stormreach]] stretches back across the [[Age of Giants]] to the dawn of [[Eberron]]. Modern Stormreach is built on the ruins of past civilizations, from [[giant]] to [[thri-kreen]] and even stranger things. Some remnants of these civilizations can be seen on the surface. Others lie hidden underground, from the sewers of the giants to entire sections of ancient cities preserved from the ravages of time.

Poised on the edge of civilization, Stormreach is a hotbed of intrigue and adventure. It is home to criminals seeking sanctuary from the laws of the [[Five Nations]], scholars working to unearth the secrets of the past, [[dragonmarked|dragonmarked house]] barons striving to exploit the untapped resources of [[Xen'drik]], and many others. 

!! What the City Offers

Hundreds arrive in Stormreach every month to start their lives anew, seek their fortune, hunt old enemies, or shrug off their homelands’ laws. Some come for freedom, others chase dreams of adventure, and many travel to the remote city as a last resort.

Unless the player characters grew up in Stormreach, how they find their way to this city of vice and peril can be an adventure in itself. A heist gone wrong, a simple bodyguard mission that turns into a regicidal frame-up, a fragment of their past pointing like a compass to the city, or any other strange occurrence
can set the PCs’ course for Stormreach.

!!! A Place to Lie Low

No city is more suited for ducking the law than Stormreach, where the [[Storm Lords]] spurn any attempts by the [[Five Nations]] to enforce the [[Code of Galifar]] within their domain. Built on piracy, the city rewards those with a taste for crime. Felons, war criminals, and even regicides can leave their pasts behind, for as a common saying goes, the city’s muck, blood, and tides wash sins away. Or perhaps most crimes simply seem trifling compared to the villainy here.

PCs who have troubled pasts, whose deeds bring agents of the law hard at their heels, might choose Stormreach as an escape. And those who are branded as outcasts elsewhere can walk in the open here, with no fear of persecution. If the PCs are framed for a crime, Stormreach is a place for them to lie low and gather their wits and resources before returning home to prove their innocence.

Stormreach is also an ideal place to spend ill-gotten loot. No one cares here how you came by your coin. The city’s brothels, drug parlors, and gambling houses find all that glitters to their liking, regardless of how much blood they need to wipe away to see the
sparkle. PCs laden with dirty gold will find no port more ready to take it. In a city of pirates, all tender is legal.

The city is the perfect place to launder money as well. Those with an interest in bringing their disreputable fortunes back to the [[Five Nations]] can cleanse them in the mire of Stormreach. Gambling on the [[Red Ring]]’s matches or purchasing gems discovered in the city’s ruins are two of the many ways to turn dirty money into unmarked valuables. Just be sure not to purchase cleverly masked knockoffs peddled by the [[Hollow Shards]], lest you exchange your gold for garbage.

!!! Thrills for the Daring

The bold can find few places better to seek adventure than in [[Xen'drik]], whether probing cyclopean ruins, battling jungle tribes, slaying mighty [[giant]]s and claiming their hoards, braving volcanoes, digging in the [[Menechtarun Desert]] for ancient secrets, or conquering Stormreach’s streets. The city is the gateway to the shattered land, and below its streets, in the dark places once presided over by lost civilizations, lie untold treasures.

Many are drawn to Stormreach like moths to a flame, and often with the same result. The city does not suffer the foolhardy lightly. Still they come by the hundreds to make corpses for porters to drag from the streets. Those with heroic hearts just might survive the city’s dangers, from cutthroats in its alleys to monsters in its dungeons, and become legends.

Stormreach is a holy city for fortune hunters, explorers, and vagabonds. It is an adventurer’s proving ground. Those who have scratched its perilous underbelly and survived are part of an exclusive club. You’re really somebody when you’ve been to Stormreach and dared the wilds of Xen’drik beyond.

!!! Evil to Hunt

Stormreach—you will find no greater den of villainy on the face of Eberron. The city’s pseudonyms, from the Pirate’s Haven to the Nest of Vipers, are too many to list. Here war criminals with the blood of hundreds on their hands consort with [[dragonmarked|dragonmarked house]] scions, [[Storm Lords]], and reputable merchants.

Where evil hides, heroes dare. PCs might have to cross the [[Thunder Sea]] to find a traitor whose actions nearly destroyed the [[Brelish|Breland]] crown, track down the [[hobgoblin]] who killed a sibling or dear friend, or find the duplicitous [[changeling]] who ruined their lives.

!! Architecture

Many of Stormreach’s buildings and monuments are ancient, but while many old cities are built upon the refinement and expansion of a style, Stormreach is built upon change, upon necessity, upon the mixture of many styles, both ancient and modern. The city’s districts have their own overall styles, defined by the inhabitants and their occupations, but the districts are still a mishmash of new buildings amid, and atop, the old.

Even with the city’s chaos of architectural styles,
its districts have common features, all arising from Stormreach’s unique character.

!!! Floating Ruins

The magic of [[Xen'drik]] is legendary, and the faded
glory of the past can still be seen in Stormreach
today. The city had a number of floating fortresses,
mansions, and towers in past centuries. Time, war,
and disaster broke them, but remnants float in
place or drift in patterns above the city, and sometimes beyond.

Some of the ruins remain serviceable, albeit ramshackle, and a few wealthy citizens have claimed them for their own, patching and rebuilding them. Other
floating chunks of masonry are treated like islands,
built upon by enterprising people. Under a few of the
larger chunks, wooden homes hang perilously and are
reachable by knotted ropes and ladders, which can be
drawn up, affording the inhabitants a secure, if precipitous, existence.

The most picturesque ruins collected seabird
guano until a windblown seed or two germinated,
creating islands of tangled plants. A riot of color, these
islands’ roots flutter in the wind.

Stormreach is also full of broken pillars of various degrees
of antiquity, though few remain standing. Those that
do are significant landmarks. These snapped-off columns once supported the roofs of [[giant]]s’ dwellings or decorated the outsides of their temples. Now they serve
other purposes. Some have been turned into watchtowers, helpful in spotting fires and directing firefighting efforts. Others have become so encrusted with
ropes and ramshackle dwellings that they resemble a
rock covered in mussels. Most, however, have suffered
the fate of being quarried for stone to pave roads, patch
city walls, and build new dwellings.

See also [[circle of visions]] and [[Stone Heads of Stormreach]].

!!! Permanent Impermanence

Many of the homes in Stormreach look temporary:
tents, huts, and shacks that seem as if they were
thrown together on a whim. Visitors are surprised
to discover that many of these driftwood huts and
canvas tents have been handed down from generation to generation.

Especially in the poorer districts, the city has a
culture of making do, patching up, and never throwing something useful away. This applies as much to
buildings as it does to pots and pans, clothing, and
other items. Old rowboats are built into roofs to keep
the rain out, and tents are patched, stitched, and
layered over and over until they are as thick as a wall.
A building that was once a temple to a forgotten deity
might be turned into a brewery and then a storehouse,
and finally the brewing vats might be capped off with
conical roofs and turned into houses, surrounded by
the temple ruins.

Nothing is wasted: driftwood, canvas, hide, whalebone, flotsam, and stone. The people of Stormreach show endless ingenuity in their use of materials that
would be rubbish in other cities.

!!! The Rigging

Stormreach was not originally built for the people who
live there now. For much of its [[history|History of Stormreach]], it was occupied
by [[giant]]s, and its buildings recall that past, from its
enormous drains to its high steps and towering columns. A [[human]] or [[elf]], let alone a [[halfling]] or [[gnome]],
would have a difficult time climbing over and around
these edifices were it not for “the rigging.”

When citizens mention the city’s rigging, they
mean the steps that have been carved into some massive
stones or the wooden ladders and staircases bolted into
or leaned against others. Or they mean the nets and
knotted ropes they use to scramble over the ruins or
the rope bridges, high above the streets, that crisscross
the city. Where the ropes and bridges are especially
dense, shanties are suspended in the air, often from
the underside of a floating ruin.

Wealthy neighborhoods such as [[Stormhaven]] and
[[Coasthold]] are built on solid ground and have relatively
clear streets, but other neighborhoods are riddled with
hazards. Tunnels and ancient sewers shift or subside,
flash floods crash through during storms (see "Scuppers" below), persistent
humidity rots rope and wood, and shacks, even those
that have survived generations, suddenly collapse. The
next plank in the bridge might break, the rope might
snap, or the tarp might be more mold than tarp—as you
discover when you put your weight on it.

!!! Scuppers

The city of Stormreach is named for the storms that batter [[Xen'drik]]’s
coast and that often engulf the city in lightning flashes and torrential rain. This rain was merely an annoyance to the [[giant]]s; a flood to the smaller races is but a puddle to them. Moreover, the ancient city’s enormous sewer system, along with its broad and open streets, allowed rainwater to drain away quickly.

Today, the city is cluttered and congested, its
streets filled with tents, market stalls, and boarding
houses. Many drains are blocked by rubbish, and others
have been sealed by the monsters that lurk in the sewers.
Despite the [[Storm Lords]]’ efforts to have the drains
cleared, most are useless for much of the year.

The few working drains usually flow like rapids, and the rest of the city’s rainwater drains from the surface, down into the harbor. Somehow this haphazard drainage system works. First, many newer buildings are built on stilts, which lets rainwater flow beneath and keeps the buildings out of the reach of vermin. Second, when a neighborhood floods, the
residents create channels to allow the water to drain onto nearby streets, and often into someone else’s neighborhood.

As rain falls, it follows a complex network of
improvised channels, which run together onto broad
streets that feed the water to the harbor. Stormreachers
call these streets //scuppers//, after the drainage holes on
ships. New settlers are sometimes washed away when
the water flows rapidly, not knowing to keep clear of
the scuppers during heavier storms.

!! Districts and Wards

Like many cities, Stormreach is divided into districts, each with a distinct character, and some of those districts are further divided into wards. Certain nationalities, [[dragonmarked house]]s, and business types tend to cluster in the different districts.

Stormreach is a frontier city with a large transient population (several thousand beyond its permanent residents). For these travelers, the city is a jumping-off point for exploring the continent’s interior or for seeking their fortunes in the city’s dungeons. And the city’s businesses are happy to cater to them. Although the services might be rough compared to those in other cities, they serve adventurers well.

Some of the districts’ citizens are leery of foreigners, fearing they might be the agents of someone or something they fled in [[Khorvaire]], yet most of these citizens are happy to take visitors’ money, whether through legitimate or illegitimate means. Many natives fleece their customers for all they can, taking advantage of their lack of knowledge of Stormreach and [[Xen'drik]].

!! People of Stormreach

Look along the harbor and consider what you see. A [[hill giant]] and a pair of House [[Tharashk]] [[orc]]s are loading [[dragonshard]]s onto a House [[Lyrandar]] cargo ship. A [[goblin]] merchant haggles with a pair of [[elves|elf]] from [[Aerenal]]. A [[dwarf]] dressed in the robes of the [[Sovereign Host]] and a [[human]] in the colors of the [[Silver Flame]] debate religion with a [[sahuagin]] [[Ta'har]] priest draped in seaweed and bones. Adventurers, scholars, mystics—all
can find their way to Stormreach.

The city is small, but many residents take pride in it. A visitor to [[Sharn]] is likely to get lost in the teeming masses. You’ll quickly get to know the people of Stormreach, and you’ll have a chance to meet even the most important people of the city. Wander the market for a day, and you’ll likely see Lord [[Lassite|Varen Lassite]]. Take a week and
you might know half the artisans, all the innkeepers,
and the city’s magistrates—hopefully because you’ve
been drinking with them and not because they’re
sending you to the [[Red Ring]]!

The city is growing rapidly. According to a [[Korranberg|Library of Korranberg]] census, the city had about 45,000 residents in 996 YK. Estimates suggest that more than ten
thousand immigrants have joined them since then, and more are arriving every day. With the [[Last War]] at an end, there’s been a groundswell of interest in the city. Refugees who lost their homes in [[Khorvaire]] come in search of a fresh start. Academics seek answers to [[Xen'drik]]’s mysteries. The [[dragonmarked house]]s see untapped potential in the lands beyond the city’s walls. And so the population grows and the city expands. Moreover, transients steadily flow through—hundreds of merchants, sailors, explorers, and others who remain for a few days before passing on to the next port of call.

For more information, see [[Culture of Stormreach]].

!! Authority Figures

This free city is governed by the [[Storm Lords]], a
hereditary council formed by the five families that
founded modern Stormreach in 802 YK. Each family
monitors a particular region of the city, and together
they oversee most of the city’s industries.

A Storm Lord wields absolute power within the
city, governing both trade and justice. Because the
lords balance each other, this power rarely turns into
tyranny. All citizens of Stormreach respect the Storm
Lords—or at least their influence over the [[Stormreach Guard]]. The Storm Lords are a frequent topic of conversation in the city’s taverns and common rooms,
and Lord [[Jonas Wylkes]] and Lord [[Varen Lassite]] often
mingle with the city’s people. Keep your eyes open and
you might see one of them!

The current [[Storm Lords]] and their families are
described below.

* Lord [[Yorrick Amanatu]], Coin Lord of [[Respite]] and [[Silverwall]]. A venerable [[dwarf]], Lord Yorrick is one of the city’s founders. His family trains and organizes the [[Stormreach Guard]]. An old maxim states, “The [[Amanatus|Amanatu family]] are the steel of Stormreach.”
* Lord [[Varen Lassite]], Coin Lord of [[Cross]] and the [[Marketplace]]. The [[Lassites|Lassite family]] are master brewers and frequently sponsor festivals and feasts. As a result, Lord Varen is easily the most popular of the [[Storm Lords]].
* Lady [[Kirris Sel Shadra]], Coin Lord of [[Southwatch]] and [[Oldgate]]. A family of [[gnome]]s, the [[Sel Shadras|Sel Shadra family]] maintain a low profile for lords of the city. Some say that the Sel Shadras have connections throughout the city’s underworld, but it is unwise to spread such rumors.
* Lady [[Paulo Omaren]], Coin Lord of [[Forgelight]] and the [[Temple District]]. The [[Omarens|Omaren family]] are the city’s premier smiths; their forge produces the arms and armor of the [[Stormreach Guard]]. Lady Paulo is a passionate young woman who claimed her current position with her blade.
* Lord [[Jonas Wylkes]], Harbor Lord overseeing the [[Harbor]] district and the shipping trade. Rumors abound of this young lord’s debauchery.

!! Crime and Punishment

See [[Crime in Stormreach]].

!! Militias

Life is cheap on the edge of [[Xen'drik]], and the only way to ensure a safe future is to have a weapon close at hand. Throughout the history of Stormreach, many ethnic and religious groups have formed [[militia]]s—people ready to defend their friends and neighbors from any threats.

After hearing tales of the harsh justice of the [[Swords of Karrn]] or the violent actions of [[Dannel's Wrath]], newcomers to Stormreach might have the impression that the militias represent a lack of control on the part of the [[Storm Lords]]. Such fears are unfounded. The Storm Lords allow the militias to exist out of respect for the diverse cultural values of the city’s people. However, many of these values are tied to hostility toward other ethnic, national, or religious groups. A traveler is therefore advised to consider the following and to avoid wards dominated by hostile forces.

* The [[Swords of Karrn]] have recently appeared in the [[Grindstone]] neighborhood of [[Southwatch]]. The exiled [[Karrnath]]i warlord [[Drago Thul]] leads this band of hardened veterans.
* The [[Knights of Thrane]] operates in the [[Embers]] ward of [[Oldgate]]. Commander [[Valen Vanatar]] believes the [[Blood of Vol]] and worship of the [[Dark Six]] pose a threat to the stability of Embers and acts accordingly.
* The [[Ninth Wands]], based in the [[Whitewash]] ward of [[Oldgate]] and largely drawn from [[Aundair]]ian veterans, are known for their use of war magic. The militia is led by a mysterious [[wizard]] known as the [[Dragonhawk]].
* [[Dannel's Wrath]] is a [[Cyran|Cyre]] militia based in [[Dannel's Pride]] in the [[Cross]] district. Rumors say that the Wrath is using violence as a tool to force the [[Storm Lords]] to provide more territory and recognition to Cyran refugees. The leader of the militia is a [[changeling]] war criminal named [[Fury|Fury (changeling)]].

!! Stormreach and the Last War

The population of Stormreach has always included immigrants from the [[Five Nations]], many of whom retain fond memories of their distant homelands. The city has never been subject to the Five Nations, but the [[Storm Lords]] gave their fealty to [[Galifar]], by virtue of its strength, and feared a day would come when the kingdom across the ocean would send its fleets to bring their city under its rule. When word reached Stormreach that King [[Jarot|Jarot ir'Wynarn]] was dead and [[Galifar]] had
collapsed in [[civil war|Last War]], the [[Lassite|Lassite family]] Storm Lord at the
time gave a shot of [[kuryeva]] to anyone who would drink
a toast to the kingdom’s fall.

Stormreach remained neutral throughout the
[[Last War]] and became a haven for dissidents and
defectors. The city is an imperfect sanctuary due to
the relative lawlessness of the streets, but those who
have sufficient funds can turn to House [[Deneith]] or
House [[Kundarak]] for security. Less affluent defectors can always find sanctuary by joining the [[Stormreach Guard]]. Whatever their flaws in protecting the common people, the guards look after their own, and the [[Stormreach Recruiters|Stormreach Guard]] ask no questions; when a man picks up a guard’s sword, he leaves his past behind.

Despite Stormreach’s neutrality, echoes of the [[Last War]] resonate through the city, where [[militia]]s and gangs have arisen based on national themes. An
adventurer who thinks the war is over might change his
mind after clashing with [[Dannel's Wrath]] or the [[Ninth Wands]] of [[Aundair]] (as long as the [[Storm Lords]] are not threatened, the [[Stormreach Guard]] ignores sectarian
violence between immigrants). The [[Last War]] continues in Stormreach in ways unseen in [[Khorvaire]], ways that surprise visitors who were involved in the war. A
former soldier could be pressured to help a [[militia]]
that has ties to his nation. [[Cyran|Cyre]] refugees could hold a
player character responsible for crimes she committed
while serving in the war. An old companion could show
up with a scheme to recover a treasure cache lost in the
war—but the soldier has been exiled, and he needs his
old war buddies to help. Vengeance, bigotry, and hope
are all aspects of Stormreach. Even in this land of new
opportunities, adventurers should come face to face
with the consequences of the war.

!! Stories in Stormreach

Stormreach is unlike any city in [[Khorvaire]]. [[Sharn]]’s vast
size provides a host of opportunities, but Stormreach’s
unique location and history make possible adventures that could never occur elsewhere in [[Eberron]]. Whether you’re playing an explorer traveling to Stormreach or you’re a GM plotting a story arc, consider the following paths a story could take.

* ''The Gate to Xen'drik:'' Stormreach is the largest [[human]] city in [[Xen'drik]]. Even if an expedition does not go directly through the city, explorers will probably use the city as a stopping point to replenish supplies or hire guides. Even adventurers who prefer pulp action over global intrigue have much to gain from making friends in Stormreach. Suppliers and smiths can provide travelers with vital goods or a market for treasures found in the continent’s interior. Sages and stranger folk, such as [[Katanavash]], can provide rewards to adventurers willing to reveal their discoveries. If PCs have the urge to adventure but have no goal in mind, Stormreach always has patrons looking for capable swords to risk venturing into the shattered land.
* ''The Tip of the Iceberg:'' With ancient dungeons below every street in Stormreach, characters in search of adventure and treasure never need to leave the city. Stormreach’s history includes occupation by [[sahuagin]], the [[psionic|psionics]] [[thri-kreen]], and [[giant]]s whose knowledge of magic outstripped that of the modern age. The world beneath the city is filled with traps, treasures, monsters, and more. If the PCs desire a dungeon crawl, Stormreach can offer it.
* ''Echoes of the Last War:'' The [[Treaty of Thronehold]] keeps tensions in check in [[Khorvaire]], but anything goes in Stormreach. Home to war criminals, dissidents, and soldiers who wish to keep the war alive, the city offers many opportunities for adventures based on the [[Last War]]. Characters could start a new movement or fight one that already exists, such as the [[Swords of Karrn]] or the [[Brelish|Breland]] antimonarchists. Political intrigue can occur in any city in Khorvaire, but in Stormreach it can occur out in the open.
* ''Mingling with Monsters:'' With [[giant]]s, [[drow]], [[sahuagin]], and others, Stormreach is home to more "monsters" than any other city outside [[Droaam]]. Stormreach provides a chance to interact with these creatures in a neutral environment and can serve as a starting point for adventures among the [[Thunder Sea]]’s [[Eternal Dominion]]; among the [[Qaltiar]] [[drow]] and their conflict with the [[Sulatar]] drow, the dreaded firebinders; and among other groups. Beyond this, Stormreach offers chances to associate with [[human]]s whom many would describe as monsters. When characters come to the [[Black Freighter]] for a tankard of ale, they might find a knight of the [[Emerald Claw]] and one of the [[Inspired]] having a discussion with a [[cultist of the Dragon Below|Cults of the Dragon Below]] or an [[Aurum]] Concordian. Stormreach is a neutral city, and justice is in the hands of the individual. Adventurers can therefore end up associating with people they would normally see on the other end of a blade.
* ''A Small Pond:''  Stormreach’s size, as well as its remoteness, means that many services expected from a larger city are unavailable. Merchants have limited funds, and selections of [[magic item]]s and services are restricted. The city’s size has a flip side; PCs can be big fish in a small pond. They would have a difficult time destroying the [[Boromar Clan]] in [[Sharn]]; the criminal organization is simply too large, too influential, too entrenched. But they could eliminate the [[Bilge Rats]] or the [[Swords of Karrn]] in Stormreach. The fight would be difficult—and a new group could rise to fill the void left behind—but the characters’ actions could have a lasting impact on the city’s balance of power.

Characters should also find it easy to make a reputation and to cross paths with other major players in the
city. This isn’t [[Sharn]], with over a million people. PCs can meet gang and militia leaders, [[dragonmark]]ed viceroys, and the [[Storm Lords]] themselves. Player characters are remarkable people, and in Stormreach that gets noticed.

Twenty more possible adventures can be found in the table below.
