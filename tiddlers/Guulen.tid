Guulen, meaning "Strength" in [[Dhakaani]], appears to be a simple rod of [[byeshk]] carved with ancient symbols. It was crafted by the legendary [[daashor|artificer]] [[Taruuzh]] thousands of years ago and presented to the emperor, and it became part of the imperial regalia of [[Dhakaan]]. It was carried for centuries until it was lost with Marhu Dabrak Riis, the Shaking Emperor, who "went out into the world to face his fears." The Rod of Kings has never been found.

Though its powers are largely unknown, the Rod of Kings was believed to grant the wielder the ability to [[dominate]] other creatures.
