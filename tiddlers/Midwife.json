The Midwife can\nflawlessly create realistic [[travel|traveling papers]] or [[identity papers|identification papers]]. She’s also the inventor of the //parchment of the cursory glance//, a set\nof identity papers that seem to always show what the\nreader expects to see. The Midwife cares only about her\ncontinued safety and her vast fortune; she’ll sell forged\npapers to anyone and asks no unnecessary questions, as\nlong as she can avoid trouble with the city watch.",
