        "text": "Many [[kalashtar]] practice //sheshan talarash dasyannah//, a Quor phrase that roughly translates to \"dancing with the shadows on the path to light\", or, more commonly, \"the path of shadows\". This is a martial art form that serves as exercise, meditation, combat training, and artistic expression. The path of shadows is a soft, fluid art, full of smooth, sweeping motions that are beautiful and hypnotic. A character who focuses on the pure movement of the dance is said to be \"staying in the light\", while one who trains for combat is \"facing the shadows\".",
