You touch a creature and create a mental trap that springs whenever their mental faculties are tampered with. Whenever a creature attempts to use spells or magic effects to charm, frighten, or force a certain behavior out of your target, the target can attempt to cancel the effect and force that creature to suffer [[psychic damage|damage type]]. The spell lasts for 24 hours or until the trap is sprung.
