type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This warm canvas robe is lined with [[roc]] down. While wearing it, you can withstand extremely frigid temperatures. In addition, when you unfurl the robe, it opens into two large, stylized wings; while the robe is unfurled, you are less resistant to environmental cold, but you can cast the [[gust]] cantrip at will.
