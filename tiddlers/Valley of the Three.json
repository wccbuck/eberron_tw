Each is ten times the size of a colossal [[dragon]], and each\nis inlaid with enough gemstones and precious metals to beggar a kingdom. Smaller statues of the fifteen [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]] stand at the feet of the greater deities. No\nimages of the [[Progenitors|Progenitor Dragons]] are present. If questioned, a follower of [[Thir]] would be surprised. \u201c[[Eberron]] is at your feet, [[Siberys]] above us, [[Khyber]] far below; what would be the point of trying to capture them in stone?\u201d\n\nAlthough [[dragon]]s worship in their\nown way, dragon priests of the [[Thousand]]\nspend a great deal of time at the Valley of the Three. Some of the greatest priests\nof the past have actually merged with the\nlandscape, becoming immortal guardians of this place. Young dragons who\nwish to learn the mysteries of the divine often come to the Valley to study with the elders.", "modified": "20210727192040414", "tags": "Argonnessen monument Thousand shrine Thir", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "article": "the ", "category": "location", "color": "#A3DB62", "points": "-16.68,140.84", "style": "{\"color\": \"#732873\"}"}
