        "text": "Originally part of the [[Healers Guild]], the Medics Guild became a distinct entity\nabout fifty years ago, when the [[Last War]] was at its\nheight. The armies of the [[Five Nations]] wanted healers who could march with them. As soon as the national armies demonstrated that they would pay\nhandsomely for that privilege, House [[Jorasco]] started\nestablishing mobile hospitals, relying on House [[Vadalis]] for sturdy draft animals and on House [[Deneith]] for military training. Like House [[Ghallanda]]â€™s [[Dragontail Guild]] of field provisioners, the Medics Guild has contracted somewhat now that the [[Last War]] is\nover. But House [[Jorasco]] has been more aggressive in finding new ways to put mobile healers to use. House [[Tharashk]], for example, is increasingly hiring the Medics Guild to assist its [[dragonshard]] prospecting operations in the [[Shadow Marches]], where diseases (and battle wounds, for that matter) run rampant.",
