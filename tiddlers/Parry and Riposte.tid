When you are in armed melee combat against an opponent in your [[challenge tier|Challenge Tiers]] or lower and you lose [[initiative]] in the fight, gain [[advantage]] on your first attempt to regain initiative. In addition, if you overfill this initiative [[progress clock]], gain +2 [[momentum]] instead of +1.
