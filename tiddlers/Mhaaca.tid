The Mhaaca are a small family of [[bugbear]]s who sell their services in [[Lower Dura]] and the [[Cogs]] of [[Sharn]] as heavy laborers. A few of the Mhaaca have broken off from the main family and joined the Cog gangs: Rhashâ€™mhaac has established his own gang of [[goblin]]s, while Kharmhaac has joined the [[Red Jackals]], much to the frustration of their father Dhurmhaac.
