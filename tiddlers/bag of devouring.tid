title: bag of devouring
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This bag superficially resembles a [[bag of holding]] but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.

The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can try to escape, or another creature can reach into the bag to pull a creature out. After only a few moments, a creature inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another [[plane]] of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.

If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is lost to the [[Astral Sea]].
