! Keepers of the Dream

The Kech Uul are a small [[clan|kech]] of the [[Heirs of Dhakaan]]. Their vault is a fortified monastery hidden deep in [[Khyber]]. This is the seat of the
//chot'uul//, the monks who watch over the [[Uul Dhakaan]] and
protect the dreams of the empire. This clan also has the largest
number of uul'kala (dream singer) bards, and knows the most about how to
produce [[dream key]]s and [[dreambound|kra'uul]] objects.

The Kech Uul have yet to return to the surface of [[Khorvaire]].
Its people spend much of their time within the [[Uul Dhakaan]]
itself, using drugs and meditation to enter the dream even while
waking. The monks of the Kech Uul are devoted to protecting
the dream from outside influences, but they're also experts in
navigating the dream itself; if a Dhakaani dreamer is searching
for a particular memory or wishes to speak with the dream-vestige of an ancient hero, a Kech Uul monk can be an invaluable
guide. Likewise, the uul'kala of the Dream Keepers are the
backbone of long-distance communication between clans; the
dream singers maintain message stations at various points within the
dream, and can pass a message from one dreamer to another.

There are several ways that the Kech Uul could fit into a
campaign. They can serve as a neutral resource supporting
all clans, maintaining communication and offering guidance
through the dream. However, it could be that they're not what
they seem. The Kech Uul have always worked to protect
[[Jhazaal|Jhazaal Dhakaan]]'s dream from outside influences, but it's possible the
clan has been partially or fully replaced by [[quori]] imposters,
who plan to influence the Emperor Yet to Come to serve the
ends of the [[Dreaming Dark]]. Or perhaps the Kech Uul was
destroyed long ago by the [[daelkyr]] or another threat; the Dream
Keepers continue to serve their function, but they're actually
long dead, and the chot'uul encountered in the Uul are simply
dream-vestiges, memories lingering in [[Dal Quor]].

The name of the Kech Uul's current leader is unknown outside
the clan. Uul dar often wear masks or veils; they do not seek
//atcha// (personal glory), and desire only to help others achieve Jhazaal's dream.
A player character tied to the Uul dar could be an uul'kala, a
[[bard]] pursuing a dream-vision or searching for dream-related artifacts. An exotic possibility is that the character believes it's possible to bring other species into the [[Uul Dhakaan]], allowing for a peaceful union; if this
is the case, is this goal supported by the clan elders, or is
the character an eccentric renegade? Alternatively, any dar
character could have a mentor from the Uul dar, who visits
them in their dreams offering guidance and inspiration.
