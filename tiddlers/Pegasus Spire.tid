type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While House [[Vadalis]] conducts most of its business in [[Dragon Towers]], the head of the household ([[dragonmark]]ed heir Asa d'Vadalis) has always resided in the Pegasus
Spire in [[Highwater]]. The [[Sharn]] Vadalis have always
enjoyed participating in the [[Race of Eight Winds]]
and the Highwater Wind Guard has always included
members of the family. In addition to serving as the manor for the Vadalis family, Pegasus Spire provides
the stable and training facilities for the [[pegasi|pegasus]] used
in the race.
