        "text": "A large section of the harbor ward of the [[Riedra]]n bastion city of [[Dar Jin]] has been transformed into a foreign quarter, called the Jhodra. [[Riedrans]] refer to\nit as \"tainted land\" outside the hearing of foreigners. Most Riedrans are forbidden to enter the Jhodra; those who work and live in the area are carefully trained to\ndeal with foreigners. Likewise, there are only two ways\nfor foreigners to leave the ward—heading back to sea via the [[Harbor of Tranquility]], or\nacquiring a transit visa from the [[Iron Gate]]. \n\nAs in most [[Riedra]]n cities, the streets and buildings\nbeyond the Jhodra are not marked with legible signs. These\nsigns, however, have been embedded into the [[sentira]]\nengravings; by concentrating on the pattern, a traveler\ncan feel the image as a faint memory in his mind. The\ninhabitants of the outer wards avoid foreigners, while\n[[Bastion Guard]]s challenge any foreigners found beyond\nthe Jhodra. \n\nMuch of the Jhodra is devoted to the shipping trade\nand is taken up with warehouses, shipyards, and the customs and inspection facilities of the [[Iron Gate]]. There are only a few Riedran businesses that cater to foreigners.\nHowever, the [[Inspired]] have leased property to each of the\n[[dragonmarked house]]s. As such, adventurers who want a\nfamiliar meal can dine at House [[Ghallanda]]'s [[Gold Dragon Inn|Gold Dragon Inn (Dar Jin)]]. The Jhodra also contains a number of embassies. To date, [[Aundair]], [[Breland]], [[Karrnath]], the [[Mror Holds]], [[Q'barra]], and [[Zilargo]] have established consulates in [[Dar Jin]]. The [[Inspired]] have not yet extended an invitation\nto the [[elves|elf]] of [[Aerenal]] or [[Valenar]]. The [[Thousand Eyes]]\nkeeps a very sharp watch on these embassies. As a result,\nthe ambassadors might turn to unfamiliar faces—such as\nadventurers—if they need to engage in subterfuge. \n\nAlthough violence is rare, the [[Inspired]] maintain a\nstrong military presence along the docks. Hundreds of\n[[Bastion Guard]]s patrol the Jhodra, along with dozens of\n[[Thousand Eyes]] guardians and a handful of [[masquer]]s.\nFifty [[Taskaan|Taskaan Legion]] [[shifter]]s are kept on alert, ready to respond\nto any report of violence. Ten [[Horned Guard]]s are also\nassigned to the Jhodra, with six on duty at any given\ntime. Four of these [[oni]] observe from the air, using invisibility to hide from the eyes of criminals. The other two wander the streets, providing an imposing\nvisual deterrent.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Jhodra has an unusually\nhigh concentration of powerful [[Chosen]] ([[creature tier]] 3). The [[Inspired]] are rightfully afraid of foreign espionage in the Jhodra and have devoted considerable\nresources to the district. \n\n!! Features of the District\n\nThe Jhodra is separated from the rest of the Harbor Ward by hhigh walls; the only exit\nis a massive iron-bound gate. Anyone who wants to leave\nmust obtain the approval of the aptly named [[Iron Gate]].\nThese diplomats process all requests for information\nand transit visas, in addition to negotiating with ambassadors and influential merchants. Every two weeks the Gate hosts a meal for influential foreigners; this is a good\nopportunity to meet the local ambassadors and [[dragonmarked|dragonmarked house]] barons. The gatekeeper of the Jhodra is Lord [[Helkadesh]].\n\n* The [[Harbor of Tranquility]]\n* The [[Healing Hand]]\n* [[Gardens of Reflection]]\n* The [[Mercantile Center]]\n* The [[Song of Skin]]\n* The [[Tower of Eyes]]\n\n!! Dragonmarked Houses\n\n[[Dragonmarked house|dragonmarked house]]s have almost no power in [[Riedra]].\nThe [[Inspired]] don't rely on house services, so they've made\nfew concessions to the barons. Further, the resources of\nthe houses are half a world away. The houses operate\nunder restrictions inside the port city of Dar Jin, and\nthey have no operations outside that city.\n\nHouse [[Cannith]] cannot create or sell arms, armor,\nor magic items of the [[conjuration]], [[enchantment]], [[evocation]], or [[necromancy]] schools. Baron ''Sien Vown d'Cannith'' represents\n[[Cannith West]] in [[Dar Jin]], but adventurers are more likely\nto deal with forge master and [[magewright]] Killian \"Blacklion\" d'Cannith, a jovial and eccentric man who demanded the Sarlonan post.\n\nHouse [[Deneith]] is permitted to maintain a force\nof only fifty soldiers. It has been warned of dire consequences should these troops cause trouble in the city.\n\nHouse [[Jorasco]] is not permitted to raise the dead, and\nthe Jorasco [[enclave]] does not have an [[altar of resurrection]]. The baron of the enclave is Dorial d'Jorasco, a devout worshiper of the [[Sovereign Host]] who requested the post in the hopes of serving his faith.\n\nHouse [[Kundarak]] has no outlets for its extradimensional vault network in Dar Jin. It would be all too easy to adapt this enterprise to smuggling.\n\nHouse [[Lyrandar]] has not been allowed to construct\na docking tower, and [[airship]]s that cross the borders of\n[[Riedra]] might come under attack. Lyrandar scions have\nbeen warned not to interfere with the weather.\n\nHouse [[Orien]] is forbidden from teleporting anyone into\nor out of [[Riedra]], although this edict is difficult to enforce.\n\nHouse [[Sivis]] has an [[enclave]] in the [[Jhodra]] with three [[speaking stone]]s, but it can take up to three days for a message to reach [[Khorvaire]]. Swifter communication can be purchased from Master Speaker Tesser Torralyn d'Sivis, who can use [[sending]]\ntwice per day at a cost of [[25c|money]] per use. The [[Thousand Eyes]] keeps an especially close watch on the Sivis enclave. The [[gnome]]s fight to preserve the security of their communications, and they consider this war of espionage and counterintelligence to be a wonderful challenge.\n\nAlthough no official restrictions are placed on\nHouse [[Phiarlan]] and House [[Thuranni]]—since they theoretically only trade in entertainment—the [[Thousand Eyes]]\nkeeps a close watch on these enclaves, and the elves know\nit. The houses of shadow are gathering information,\nbut they're keeping a low profile, accepting no tasks that\ncould jeopardize their standing in [[Dar Jin]].\n\nThe house [[enclave]]s are small, and they're not as\ncommercially oriented as those found in the major cities\nin [[Khorvaire]]. They cater primarily to foreigners. This\nsituation is useful for the [[Inspired]]; the presence of [[Ghallanda]] hostels means that no [[Riedrans]] have to provide\nhospitality for outlanders within Dar Jin. More important, the enclaves serve as embassies for their houses. As\nthe houses begin to define their role in [[Riedra]], strategic\nalliances become ever more important.\n\nThe possibility lingers that the [[Inspired]] opened\n[[Dar Jin]] as a trap, bringing foreign ambassadors and\ndragonmarked scions into a controlled environment\nwhere they can be subverted to the Riedran cause.\nRegardless, the longer the Inspired observe the dignitaries, the more effective any future substitution or subversion will be.
