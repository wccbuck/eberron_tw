title: grayflower perfume
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This perfume is made from the rare grayflower, known to grow only in [[Q'barra]]'s swamps. The grayflower's faint scent is enough to confound even the sharpest sense of smell. Applying this perfume to a creature makes that creature effectively invisible to creatures with [[blindsight]] based on smell.
