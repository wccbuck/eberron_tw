Yerod Toothdiver gained his sobriquet when he dove off
a ship into [[Shargon's Teeth]] to battle [[sahuagin]], buying
his crew enough time to sail safely through the strait.
His men mourned him as lost, but six days later Yerod
washed up on the shore of [[Stormreach]], battered and
waterlogged but alive.

From that day forth, Yerodâ€™s reputation as a thunder guide was sealed. Over the next few years, he traveled through many continents. Eleven months ago, he
declared he would explore [[Argonnessen]].

Despite his preparations, Yerod and his men found
the dangers of the [[dragon]] continent overwhelming.
Only a few weeks after they set foot on Argonnessen,
a nasty [[bronze dragon]] enslaved the [[gnoll]]s. For several
months, Yerod and his companions played the part of mindless minions, all the while plotting their escape. Finally the day came, and the gnolls fled. Now they race
across the Vast, desperate to find the coastline and somehow escape Argonnessen before their former master finds them.
