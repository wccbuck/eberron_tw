title: Winter's Edge
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

During the [[Age of Demons]], [[Dral Khatuur]] had little need of armies; the cold itself was her greatest weapon. But there was some joy to be found in corruption, and she crafted Winter’s Edge as a lure to the minions of her [[overlord]] rivals. 

Winter's Edge takes the form of a greatsword forged of black steel. The razor-sharp blade is inlaid with patterns of ice, and it is always chillingly cold to the touch. Swinging the blade creates a burst of icy wind on impact which bypasses any resistance to [[cold damage|damage type]], and its attacks have much higher [[impact]] against [[dragon]]s. 

In addition, Winter's Edge grants its wielder near-immunity to cold damage, as well as the ability to see clearly in snowstorms and walk through loose snow without hindrance.

The sword is intelligent and malicious; its sentience is an aspect of [[Dral Khatuur]] herself, and the blade channels the souls of its victims to her (much like a [[Keeper's Fang]]). Using this weapon strengthens the Heart of Winter—but its power can be seductive!
