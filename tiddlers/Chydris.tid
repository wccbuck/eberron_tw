Chydris was the first[[*|Lurching Tower]] and most celebrated of [[Breland]]'s famous floating citadels created and used during the [[Last War]]. Chydris was instrumental in Breland's decisive victory against [[Thrane]] in the Second Battle of [[Lurching Tower]], but was lost and destroyed in the [[Battle of Cairn Hill]]. Its remains still sit on the fields just south of [[Cairn Hill]], but the [[Thrane]] government restricts access to the public.
