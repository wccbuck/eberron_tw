title: sculpting putty
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This soft putty smells faintly like cornstarch. Shape the putty however you like, then tap a special tuning fork and touch it (still vibrating) to the clay. The clay sets hard in exactly its current shape, as tough as strong ceramic. Another touch from the tuning fork shatters it.
