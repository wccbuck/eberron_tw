Gain a single [[psionics]] spell. Whenever you [[push yourself]] to use psionics, you gain two effective [[momentum]] bonuses rather than one, but on a [[bad outcome]], gain an additional "complication" [[consequence]].

Each additional time you take this talent grants spells as per the [[Spellcaster]]/[[2|Spellcaster 2]]/[[3|Spellcaster 3]] rules, choosing spells classified as [[psionics]].
