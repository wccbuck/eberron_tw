While Ambassador [[Syra ir'Tarrn]] deals with the legitimate diplomatic activities of the [[Karrnath embassy|Karrnath Embassy (Sharn)]] in [[Sharn]], [[Malen Torr]], a ruthless spymaster, handles espionage and shadow work.

Malen Torr is loyal to [[Karrnath]], but he does not
approve of the [[king|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]]â€™s promotion of peace; Malen
believes that the only way to secure true peace is
to restore [[Galifar]] under Karrn rule. He has made
contact with a number of the warlords of Karrnath
who share his opinions, and in the future he may set
plots in motion to disrupt the peace process and to
weaken [[Breland]] or gain control of new weapons for
Karrnath. Depending on the political and ethical
alignment of a party of adventurers, Malen could be
a valuable patron or a deadly foe.
