Qâ€™anhyrde, a [[red|red dragon]] [[rogue dragon]] in [[Khorvaire]], served well as a [[Chamber]] agent for almost a hundred years. His work deciphering the [[Draconic Prophecy]] and struggling to shape it eventually overwhelmed him; he declared nothing mattered but the present. Now he surrounds himself with minions and lives a life of hedonism.
