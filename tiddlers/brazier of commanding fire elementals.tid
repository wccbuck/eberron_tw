title: brazier of commanding fire elementals
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can speak the brazier's command word and
summon a [[fire elemental]], as if you had cast the [[conjure elemental]] spell. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
