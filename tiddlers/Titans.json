Still, for all their advantages, they lack the savvy to navigate the twists and turns of\nStormreach’s treacherous underworld. More often than not, the Titans end up being used in other crew’s schemes and not seeing a big cut of the profits.\n\nThe [[eneko]] don’t walk softly, and they often attract far too much attention with their brutish tactics. The gang suffered badly at the hands of more than a few [[Guard|Stormreach Guard]] crackdowns recently, and their enemies far outnumber their friends.",
