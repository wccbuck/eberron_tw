Though he views his work as profoundly significant to the modern city, and it is easily accessible even to the common populace, his research is constantly overshadowed by the more flashy and popular work being done in [[Xen'drik]]. His popularity among the students of [[Morgrave University]] certainly suffers because he is a terrible lecturer and generally a bore.",
