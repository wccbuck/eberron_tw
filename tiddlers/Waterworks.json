Behind the pipes and steam vents stand sealed iron doors, which\nlead into the [[kobold]]-infested sewers.\n\nThe [[giant]]s built everything big, and the vaulted\nsewer system is no exception. As one travels deeper\nand deeper into it, it gets older and, eventually, ties\ninto the buried buildings of the [[old city|Undercity]]. The deepest\ntunnels are home to things more dangerous, and more\ndisturbing, than [[kobold]]s.",
