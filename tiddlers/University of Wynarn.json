        "text": "[[Morgrave University]] might be better known, but [[Fairhaven]]'s University of Wynarn—the first institution of higher learning in the [[Five Nations]]—is better respected. The campus outgrew its initial building long ago and now encompasses six sprawling structures equipped with dormitories, apartments, libraries, restaurants, coffee houses, theaters, classrooms, laboratories, and museums. Though not quite as impressive as the great\n[[Library of Korranberg]], the Royal Collection of [[Aundair]]\nstacks up as the second-best repository of tomes and scrolls\nin all of [[Khorvaire]].\n\nThe university remained open throughout the [[Last War]], but fewer and fewer enrollees arrived. By the war’s end, the professors outnumbered the students. To increase enrollment, the university relaxed its restrictions on attendees and invited new students from all nations. The new policy created a cosmopolitan mix of scholars including [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[shifter]]s, and even a few [[warforged]]. This diversity has resulted in increased tensions among the student body, and strident calls for more representation of minority races among the teaching staff. Still, the university is committed to educate as it has over the centuries and has taken steps to accommodate its diverse population.",
