        "text": "[[Morgrave University]] might be better known, but [[Fairhaven]]'s University of Wynarn—the first institution of higher learning in the [[Five Nations]]—is better respected. The campus outgrew\nits initial building long ago and now encompasses\nsix sprawling structures equipped with dormitories,\napartments, libraries, restaurants, coffee houses, theaters, classrooms, laboratories, and museums. Though not quite as impressive as the great\n[[Library of Korranberg]], the Royal Collection of [[Aundair]]\nstacks up as the second-best repository of tomes and scrolls\nin all of [[Khorvaire]].\n\nThe university remained open throughout the [[Last War]], but fewer and fewer enrollees arrived. By the\nwar’s end, the professors outnumbered the students.\nTo increase enrollment, the university relaxed its\nrestrictions on attendees and invited new students\nfrom all nations. The new policy created a cosmopolitan mix of scholars including [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[shifter]]s,\nand even a few [[warforged]]. This diversity has resulted\nin increased tensions among the student body, and\nstrident calls for more representation of minority races\namong the teaching staff. Still, the university is committed to educate as it has over the centuries and has\ntaken steps to accommodate its diverse population.",
