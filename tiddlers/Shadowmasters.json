        "text": "The Shadowmancers are a cabal of a dozen [[necromancer|necromancy]] [[dragon]]s who share lore and maintain secret libraries scattered across the [[Vast]]. Like most [[Argonnessen]] dragons, the Shadowmasters share a steadfast enmity for the [[Undying Court]] of [[Aerenal]]. Unlike their so-called elders in the [[Conclave]], however, these dragon necromancers believe that understanding the power of the [[Shadow]] is the only way to ultimately prevail against the [[Aereni]] and their [[deathless]] lords.\n\n[[Arstyvrax]] is a prominent member of the Shadowmasters. Their nondragon contacts include [[Thinrukidis]] of [[Io'lokar]].",
