This large piece of soft blue parchment is rolled into a scroll and fastened with a string of blue glass beads. When the scroll is thrown on the ground and the incantation is uttered, a 10 foot diameter pond of water explodes into existence, complete with algae and small, colorful fish. The pond is permanent and this scroll can only be used once.
