tooltip: Storyloom mechanic: increase momentum, grant yourself an advantage to increase your odds of success on a later "overcome" attempt
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Throw sand in an opponent’s eyes, set something on fire, discover the weakness of a monster, taunt someone with predisposition to a bad temper—whenever you want to do one of these things to improve your odds of reaching your goals, you are ''boost''ing your narrative momentum. Successful attempts don't advance any [[progress clock]]s; instead, you gain [[momentum]] equal to your [[impact]] level, or alternatively, change the fiction of the scene such that the situation is less [[risk]]y or is otherwise more favorable to you. You can also use this action to help another character, increasing their [[momentum]] rather than your own.
