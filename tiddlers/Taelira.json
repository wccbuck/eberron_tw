        "text": "Lady Taelira is the consul of [[Aerenal]] in [[Sharn]], and has held this post for over 300 years. Taelira has little interest in the wars or conflicts of the younger races, and she\nis unlikely to take an interest in anything that adventurers bring to her attention; if there’s a problem, her inclination is to wait a year and see if it’s still an\nissue. Trade agreements are an exception to this rule,\nand Taelira is a vicious negotiator when it comes to\nprotecting the economic interests of the [[elves|elf]].\n\nWhile she is rarely helpful, Lady Taelira shows more respect toward characters who possess the [[Right of Counsel]]. She is also a confidant of [[Mayne Jhaelian]], the priest of the [[Gates of Passage]] in [[Shae Lias]], and if Mayne sends the characters to Taelira, she listens. ",
