The Wavecrest is,\nunusually for the [[area|Harbor]], a drinking hole of good repute\nand some class, despite being a little rough around the\nedges. The inn hosts a popular [[arm wrestling tournament|tournament of might]] each week. [[Aida]] is the tavern's most popular employee. [[Gimcrack the Sly]] is a regular.\n\nThe Wavecrest was built atop caves beneath the\ncurrent waterline, and someone listening at the floorboards can hear the water surging beneath. A short while ago, a cave-in cut off the innâ€™s cellar from these\ncaves, but it is only a matter of time before subsidence\nopens them up again.",
