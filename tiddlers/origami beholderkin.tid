When you read this scroll, it folds itself into a tiny origami orb with a single central eye and many smaller eyestalks. The origami [[aberration]] is considered [[creature tier]] ''1'', and obeys your commands. The orb can fly up to 5 mph, and is able to cast the following spells: [[acid splash]], [[ray of frost]], [[burning hands]], or [[dispel magic]]. After one hour, or when the orb is incapacitated, it is destroyed in a flash of flame.
