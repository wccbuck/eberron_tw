title: Upper Menthis
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Elegant and civilized, Upper Menthis is home to four of
the finest theaters in [[Breland]]: the cutting-edge [[Art Temple]], the colorful [[Khavish Theater]], the traditional [[Grand Stage]], and the open-air [[Stargazer Theater]], as well as
the [[Kavarrah Concert Hall]]. 

The shops in Upper Menthis deal mainly in fine food, fashion, and exotic goods. For instance, in the [[Seventh Tower]] district, [[Window on Yesterday]], [[Echoes of the Past]], the [[Mekdall Gallery]], and [[Cloud Antiquities]] all buy and sell interesting antiques and trinkets from distant lands (see [[Little Xen'drik]]).

The district of [[Den'iyas]] is a [[gnome]] neighborhood
that provides a glimpse into the culture of [[Zilargo]]. [[Davandi Fine Tailoring]] is the source of some of the finest
[[glamerweave]] clothing in [[Khorvaire]], and the district also hosts a number of businesses that specialize in [[alchemy|alchemist]],
[[illusion]], or [[divination]]. Visitors should be aware that intrigue is the primary pastime in Den'iyas, and that hapless adventures can easily find themselves pulled into
intricate schemes or feuds.

Upper Menthis also contains the [[University District]],
home to Breland's finest institutions of learning.
