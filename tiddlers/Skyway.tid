''District Type: ''Sky district<br/>
''Buildings:'' Temples ([[Silver Flame]], [[Sovereign Host]]), upscale lodging
(40), upscale food (50), exotic trades (20), upscale
trades (40), upscale residences (120)<br/>
''First Impression:'' This district is almost silent,
floating on clouds high above the hubbub of the city.
Servants scurry about from fabulous mansions to
exquisite shops, while the gentry who call this place
home parade in state, often riding griffons or hippogriffs, as they call upon their counterparts.<br/>
''Social Class:'' Upper class

A number of floating towers drift above the upper wards
of [[Sharn]], but these are dwarfed by Skyway, an entire
district suspended above and between [[Central Plateau]]
and [[Menthis Plateau]]. Built on an island of solidified
cloud, Skyway holds the mansions of the wealthiest
people in [[Khorvaire]]â€”nobles whose feet never touch the
ground. It's a realm of wonders, filled with the finest
examples of luxury and extravagance that gold can buy
and magic can produce. For instance, [[Cloudpool Park]] is
formed from sculpted cloudstuff, with window panels of
ice that provide a view of the city below.

Skyway is home to lavish estates. Prior to the [[Last War]], noble families from across the [[Five Nations]] maintained mansions here. Though some of these places
remain in the hands of their original owners, others
were seized by the crown during the Last War and sold to wealthy citizens of [[Breland]]. The resulting influx of
residents has brought more diversity to the district, with
[[dragonmark]]ed heirs and even wealthy criminals living
alongside the nobility. The grandest estate in Skyway is
Tain Manor, home of the [[ir'Tain family]] and the monthly
[[Tain Gala]].

This district offers the highest-priced services in the city. The [[Dragon's Hoard]] is a [[Ghallanda]] resort, where travelers can enjoy the utmost in luxury if they can afford the most expensive amenities. The [[Celestial Vista]] and the [[Cloud Dragon]] are wondrous restaurants. The [[Azure Gateway]] is a new hotel and restaurant that has
replaced a [[Ghallanda]] establishment. The owner has
remained anonymous, and this touch of mystery has
piqued interest in the place.

If you're interested in mingling with nobles or celebrities, or if you want to pull off a heist that targets the richest people in Sharn, Skyway is the place to do that.

No bridges or lifts connect Skyway to the rest of the
city, so the usual way to reach the floating district is by
taking a [[skycoach]] or hiring a flying mount. 

The Skyway consists of two neighborhoods: ''Brilliant'' to the north, and ''Azure'' to the south.
