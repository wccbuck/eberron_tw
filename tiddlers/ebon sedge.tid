Ebon sedge is a type of grass that grows only in the [[Mabar]]an [[manifest zone]]s of the island of [[Farlnen]] in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. Rather than sunlight, it feeds on shadows and thrives in darkness; it is used as both a spice and as an [[alchemical|alchemist]] material component. The grass was developed over a thousand years ago by the [[Grim Lord|Grim Lords]] [[Varonaen]], along with other botanical innovations.
