Pyraelas, the Love Lost in Flame, is a [[balor]] of an [[Inferno|Infernos]] of [[Fernia]]. He is a symbol of tragic loss, and his domain supports that story—he might dwell in a castle that is forever succumbing to flames, burning as he passes but slowly regenerating behind him, never fully lost to the fire. The castle is a symbol, just as he is; he doesn't //need// to burn down the castle, because he is content to know that at this moment, a child is losing their father in a barn fire in [[Ardev]].

Before meeting this balor, each player might reflect on a tragedy their character endured involving fire. Pyraelas will know these stories. If any of them lost a loved one to a fire, Pyraelas will reminisce about the death, and may be able to call up the final words of that person, spoken in their voice. He didn't necessarily cause those deaths, just as the [[Dominion|dominion]] of Swords doesn't cause swords to exist. But this [[balor]] knows about them, and he exists to remind us of those tragedies, to twist the knife in the wound, and to embody the pain caused by a love lost in flame. He was there when King Azikan threw himself on his lover's pyre in ancient [[Sarlona]], and he will be there when the [[Five Nations]] are lost in ashes and you are a long-forgotten memory.

How Pyraelas deals with adventurers who come into his domain depends on their purpose. Did they come looking to steal something from his burning castle? Are they seeking information about someone who died in fire long ago, a secret only he knows as the embodiment of Love Lost In Flame? He may just attack the interlopers, but he is more likely to talk to them first—to reminisce about what they’ve lost to flame in the past, to taunt them with what fire will take from them in days ahead. And then, he would make an offer: he’ll allow them all to leave safely, except for one person; that adventurer will die slowly in fire. Or perhaps the price will be someone who’s not even there: "You can leave here in peace, paladin: but your sister will die, trapped beneath a burning beam." 

Dealing with Pyraelas means dealing with the cruelty of fire itself. And should you defeat him? He’ll return. Because you may hack a winged [[fiend]] to pieces with your blades, but tomorrow, loved ones will still be dying in fires, and eventually Pyraelas will return to his burning castle to remind us of that. Depending how you defeat him, it might take a while; it could even be that he’ll return as Pyraela, a queen crying burning tears. But there will always be a [[balor]] in [[Fernia]] who embodies Love Lost In Flame. It’s not a choice they get to make; it’s a glorious purpose.
