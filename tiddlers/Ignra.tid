The [[Mokush]] village priest of [[Inspiration|Path of Inspiration]] is thoroughly corrupted by the
[[Horned Shadow]] and is [[Yrnuxi]]'s devoted lackey. Worshiping [[fiend]]s has sparked Ignra's spirit, and she can now actually cast [[spell]]s for the first time in her life. She's
careful to keep her wicked talent a secret.
