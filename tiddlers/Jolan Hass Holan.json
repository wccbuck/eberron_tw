He is widely respected for his work on the human settlement of [[Khorvaire]], and his book //Malleon’s Legacy// shed new light on a difficult time. \n\nIn his //War and Death: A History of Karrnathi Necromancy//, Holan asserts that the plagues and famines [[Karrnath]] suffered early in the war were due to the [[Seekers|Blood of Vol]] who normally tended to [[Mabar]]an [[manifest zone]]s being pushed out of them due to strategic concerns—which, in turn, forced Karrnath to embrace [[necromancy]] to counter the effects of those famines.\n\nProfessor Holan is currently delving into the mysteries of the ancient [[goblin]] civilizations; he has advanced the exotic theory that [[goblinoid]]s may have emerged from a [[demiplane]] within [[Khyber]] which has yet to be found. He is looking for bold students willing to do some practical exploration in the semester ahead!\n\nIn addition, every year during the feast of [[Aureon's Crown]] in [[Sharn]], Professor Holan organizes the <<navAndScrollToHeader \"Aureon's Crown\" \"Crowns for the Crown\">> challenge.",
