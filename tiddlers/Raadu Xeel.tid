Raadu Xeel was a member of the [[Keepers of the Word]], and a respected teacher and [[arcanist|arcane magic]] in [[Kasshta Keep]]. His body was honed and his mind sharp. He had waited years, aiding Speaker Geetru in every manner possible,
hoping to become the next Speaker. But temporal ambition is unseemly to the ascetics, and Raadu was known to have delved into lore thought better left alone. Geetru
couldn't have placed Xeel as Speaker if she had wanted
to—the elders wouldn't have allowed it.

Under false pretenses, a sect of magicians offered Xeel
aid—actually [[Endseekers]] hoping to gain control of Kasshta's resources. Raadu saw an alliance with these mages as a way to expand the [[Keepers|Keepers of the Word]]' knowledge in the future. Finding an inroad with dark philosophies that Raadu had
already assimilated, the Endseekers slowly corrupted Xeel,
even as he ingratiated himself to others in [[Kasshta Keep]]
and the [[new Speaker|Chanaakar]] alike. He hoped that his behavior
would place him in a controlling position when all was
done. The Endseekers convinced him he should become
Speaker, and that they could help. All Xeel had to do was
open the gate door at the right time.

Ultimately, the [[Endseekers]] and their dark minions
tried to assassinate Speaker [[Chanaakar]] after gaining access to
[[Kasshta Keep]] with Xeel's aid. But they failed, thanks to
[[Luunkashtai]], Kaala, and the monks. When the truth of the
plot was uncovered, the elders had Xeel executed and his
family banished from Kasshta Keep, despite Chanaakar's
request for mercy.
