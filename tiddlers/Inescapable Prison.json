It's\ndesigned to hold [[celestial]]s, [[elemental]]s, and other beings with\nvast power; there are convicts here from a half-dozen [[plane]]s of\nexistence. Mortals can also be imprisoned here; their biological\nprocesses are put in suspension, so they don't need to eat or\ndrink, and they don't age. It's rare for mortals to end up here, but\nthere may be a few legendary historical figures, long thought\ndead, who have instead been held in the Inescapable Prison!",
