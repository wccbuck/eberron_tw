As natureâ€™s beauty reaches its height in late spring, Promisetide is a time when the faithful of the [[Silver Flame]] renew their vows to fight against evil and protect the innocent. This holiday is a day of reflection on personal and communal sacrifices made in the past year, and a day for Flamists to reaffirm their commitment to the Silver Flame's cause and to each other. In this way, the holiday encourages looking forward to a better future, while emphasizing taking an active role in creating that future.
