You have sworn fealty to a [[dragonmarked house]]. You may be a member of one of the house's influential families; otherwise you're an outsider who hopes to make your fortune through the house. Your main task is to serve as the eyes of your house, but you could be called on at any time to act as its hand. Such missions can be perilous but lucrative.

Gain an [[arcane signet ring]] of your [[dragonmarked house]]. Gain [[advantage]] when requesting favors from a person associated with your dragonmarked house or its [[trade guild]]s. 

In addition, you are assumed to have at least baseline skill with each of the [[toolset]]s and other equipment associated with your house (see the tables below). This doesn't mean you gain [[advantage]] when using such a toolset, just that you are able to use them competently.
