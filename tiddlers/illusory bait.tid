title: illusory bait
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Typically found in packages of 3-6, an illusory bait is a small pouch of a bland, chalky white substance. However, when activated by holding a bait and saying the command word along with a type of creature, the baits become cloaked with an illusion that makes them appear to look, smell, and taste like food highly desirable to the chosen creature type. The illusion persists for 3 hours or until the bait is swallowed. Discerning creatures may be able to detect the nature of the illusion. The bait is itself harmless when eaten, but can be freely mixed with poisons.
