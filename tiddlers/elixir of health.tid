This clear red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it, and has a strong unpleasant taste. 

When you drink this potion, it cures any disease or poison afflicting you, and it heals temporary blindness, deafness, and paralysis. Afterwards, you sweat copiously for several minutes, but suffer no other ill effects.
