Ix Il'ar was a [[titan]] city-state in [[Xen'drik]] during the [[Age of Giants]], and was part of the [[Group of Eleven]] alliance. The titans of Ix Il'ar were ancestors of modern [[frost giant]]s, and specialized in [[Risia]]n [[planar magic|Externalist Theory]], which they perfected into a form of [[necromancy]]. By channeling the preserving energies of the Plain of Ice, the titans were able to apply a form of stasis to their own bodies, halting their aging and freeing their souls in a form of [[astral projection]]; many titans remained in this state for centuries at a time. The Il'ari crafted [[simulacra|simulacrum]] out of snow, icy [[construct]]s which dutifully maintained the city, and could be possessed and directly controlled by the projected spirit of a frost titan.

With indefinitely extended lifespans and relative isolation, the titans of Ix Il'ar filled the centuries by creating art. Sculptors crafted intricate simulacra to resemble beasts and mythical creatures. Musicians played melodies on crystal instruments to glittering ice-construct dancers. [[Arcane|arcane magic]] artists created displays of flowing crystal that caught the light of the setting sun. The city of Ix Il'ar itself was sculpted from waves of ice, carved and shaped into intricate towers and floating bridges, and inlaid with flowing patterns of amber.

Ix Il'ar's beauty disguised one of its most important functions within the [[Group of Eleven]]: an unbreakable prison for the worst criminals of the [[age|Age of Giants]]. Offenders too important or difficult to kill were sent to the Amber Lock of Ix Il'ar, rendered unconscious, and frozen in coffins of perpetual stasis. These included would-be usurpers, fiendish cultists, and [[Qabalrin]] [[vampire]]s who gorged on souls. After so many millennia, the wards on the Amber Lock may be fading... and any number of ancient villains may begin to emerge from the permafrost.

The Archarcanist [[Il'ara]] was the matriarch of Ix Il'ar, having founded the city-state that bears her name. She invented or advanced most of the magical techniques central to Il'ari society, and considered the city's frost titans her children. When the [[dragon]]s launched their assault on titan civilization, Il'ara led an exodus into the [[Frostmantle]] of [[Risia]], seeking sanctuary in the isolation of the Plain of Ice. She remains there to this day.
