The Paelions were considered the most talented assassins in the [[dragonmarked house]]. After learning of an alleged plot in which the Paelions would exterminate the other lines and other prominent leaders, the [[Thuranni]] family killed nearly every member of the Paelion family in 972 YK, sparking the [[Shadow Schism]].\n\nToday, some survivors of the Paelion line have formed an organization called the [[Bloody Shadows]], dedicated to exacting vengeance.\n\nIn a small region in [[Karrnath]], the cursed monsters known as [[peryton]]s are imbued with fragments of the vengeful spirits of Paelion elves.",
