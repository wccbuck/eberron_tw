        "text": "This [[layer]] of [[Shavarath]] looks like it was once a city of marvels, with towers\nrivaling those of [[Sharn]], gilded monuments, museums,\ngardens, and more. But the City of Knives lies between vast\narmies of the Legion of [[Justice]] and the Legion of [[Tyranny]],\nand it represents the impact of brutal war on a glorious city.\nOngoing bombardment is a constant threat. The civilian\nconscripts are fighting their own war for shelter and supplies;\nsome rally together for the common good, while others have\nbecome looters and brigands. Justice and Tyranny hold their\npositions on either side of the city, relying on bombardment\nand occasional assaults. The Legion of [[Cruelty]] spreads terror\nwithin the city, while the [[celestial]]s of the Legion of [[Freedom]]\nseek to rally the common people against all enemies.",
