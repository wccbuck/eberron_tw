Husks are harmless [[shade]]s in [[Dolurrh]] that have been overcome by
ennui and possess only the vaguest memories of their mortal
existence. Most retain a semblance of their mortal shape, but
they continue to fade over decades, eventually merging with
other husks to form masses of moaning mist. Having no true
consciousness of their own, husks are immune to ennui's
effects. Occasionally, a group of husks cluster around a strong
memory, forming an ectoplasmic mass that prowls in search of
more scraps of memory, absorbing other husks. Such a creature
is called a [[meld]].
