All members of a house\nbloodline undergo this Test of Siberys during\nadolescence. Those heirs who don’t develop a\ndragonmark are presumed not to have it, though\nsome do develop fledgling or even [[Siberys marks|dragonmark]] later\nin life.\n\nThe Test of Siberys varies for each\n[[dragonmark]]. The basic principles are the same\nacross a particular mark, but different house\n[[enclave]]s and barons are known to put unique\ntwists on the test, thus keeping the young\nscions from attempting to duplicate dangerous\ntests on their own. While the Test of Siberys\nis specifically designed to trigger a mark, it’s\nnot the only way to force a manifestation. Any\nstressful situation might trigger a spontaneous\nmanifestation. An heir of a house could develop\ntheir mark before being tested, while a foundling\nborn outside of the house could trigger a latent\nmark by unknowingly replicating the conditions\nof a Test of Siberys. Additionally, some records\nreflect accounts of heirs within the true\ndragonmarked bloodlines manifesting [[aberrant dragonmark]]s, much to the dismay of the House. Many of the foremost experts on the [[Draconic Prophecy]], like Professors [[Caldyn|Ohnal Caldyn]] and [[Ennis|Cord Ennis]] of [[Morgrave University]],\nhypothesize that such instances are the design of\nthe larger tapestry of fate, and marks appear in\ncompleting the necessary steps toward whatever\nend the Draconic Prophecy declares.\n\nIn creating a [[dragonmark]]ed character, think\nabout the events that caused your dragonmark to\nmanifest. Did you undergo the Test of Siberys or\ndid your mark manifest independently?\n\n!! Example Tests\n\nThe following list looks at just a few of the\nchallenges and forms of stress involved in the\nTest of Siberys. \n\n!!! [[Mark of Detection]]\n\nAn interview in which a candidate is locked in a room slowly filling with water, faced with two identical subjects and must determine if either, both, or neither are [[changeling]]s, and the correct answer yields the key to safety. Many applicants manifest the mark simply from the stress of suffocation, even if they fail the requirements of the test. Since that is the true purpose of the test, such successes are praised just as are those who exit the room with dry boots. \n\n!!! [[Mark of Finding]]\n\nA candidate must track a designated target, often through the [[Shadow Marches]] and, depending on the skill of the candidate, such extended hunting might involve ever increasingly dangerous [[beast]]s. In a city, the test might involve tracking a House [[Tharashk]] mentor. In either case, failure will bring shame on the family, and could involve injury or death, especially if the prey gets the drop on a would-be hunter.\n\n!!! [[Mark of Handling]]\n\nThe [[dragonmark]] allows its bearer to befriend [[monstrosities|monstrosity]], and the most common test is to be locked in a small space with an angry [[hippogriff]]. Candidates might also be faced with a stampede of lesser [[beast]]s, challenged to wrangle a herd of cats, or otherwise presented with a difficult task involving the handling animals. \n\n!!! [[Mark of Healing]]\n\n[[Jorasco]] heirs are often paired with a small pet for a year before the test. Once the two have had time to bond, they’re locked in a room and the animal is mortally wounded, and it is up to the heir to stabilize the creature and nurse it overnight. At regular intervals, and if the candidate manages to use natural medicine to stabilize the creature, additional wounds are sustained until the [[dragonmark]] appears, or the subject expires. If the mark manifests, candidates are innately able to cast [[spare the dying]] or some other spell to save their beloved pet. As inhumane as this might appear, [[Jorasco]] has one of the highest rates of manifestation among the dragonmarked bloodlines, and other tests have been theorized but proved ineffective. This practice was deemed more favorable than sending Jorasco heirs into the field during the [[Last War]] in hopes that a mark manifests as members of their squad lay dying.  \n\n!!! [[Mark of Hospitality]]\n\nThe most common feature of the Mark of Hospitality includes a strong power of persuasion, and the [[Ghallanda]] trials largely revolve around high-stakes baking tournaments. In these bake-offs, candidates often aren’t given all the ingredients they require, challenging the heirs to either find a way to overcome this handicap through exceptional talent or to convince the judges that the proposed meal was a subpar selection, and the dish presented is more appropriate to suit the pallet given the ingredients, which likely requires the ability to make fast [[friends]].\n\n!!! [[Mark of Making]]\n\nThe heir is stranded in a junk heap with a specific challenge that will allow them to escape imprisonment. To accomplish this, the heir must either [[mend|mending]] broken equipment or use [[magecraft]] to cobble together something entirely new. \n\n\n!!! [[Mark of Passage]]\n\nSpeed is the defining feature of the Mark of Passage, and the candidates are often pitted against each other in foot races to deliver packages to the administrators containing letters of their success, dodging [[iron defender]]s while wild [[beast]]s are set after them. Those who fall behind might suffer a mauling. As a final safeguard against the crafty candidate, an heir that takes too long to deliver the package also carries with it the mark manifesting stress of the explosive properties infused within the parcel. \n\n!!! [[Mark of Scribing]]\n\nSome [[Sivis]] [[enclave]]s focus on the translating abilities of the mark, creating tests that require an immediate translation. An heir could be placed in a dire situation such as being poisoned, or locked in an increasingly inhospitable space, left only with incomprehensible instructions that reveal the keys to survival. Others require a perfect act of scribing, which some might call forgery, perfectly duplicating a challenging piece of writing, such as a legal document. Failing this test could very well mean imprisonment, should the authorities happen upon such replication and detect its imperfections.\n\n!!! [[Mark of Sentinel]]\n\nSimilar to House [[Jorasco]], [[Deneith]] heirs are often paired with dogs or other animals. After a year of bonding, the heir must keep their animal companion alive through a harrowing week of unexpected assaults and hidden threats otherwise impossible without the assistance of a [[dragonmark]].\n\n!!! [[Mark of Shadow]]\n\nThe heir is sealed in a space with a brutal foe and must successfully evade the enemy for a period. Some [[enclave]]s prefer to avoid these tests of stealth and instead focus purely on a display of artistic talent well beyond the level of most professional entertainers. \n\n!!! [[Mark of Storm]]\n\nThe candidate is stranded in a dinghy on storm-tossed water and must make their way safely to land. If the fear of drowning is not enough to awaken the heir’s mark, the fear of being lost at sea is often cited as the catalyst to achieve the desired result.\n\n!!! [[Mark of Warding]]\n\nA common trial involves heirs being sealed in vaults and abandoned. The candidate works to overcome the locks before succumbing to hunger and thirst. Alternatively, late bloomers might face a dangerous threat approaching in the distance, and the candidate must repair a chamber’s locks and enter before it arrives.",
