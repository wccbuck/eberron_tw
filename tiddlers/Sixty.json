But the\nmajority of the wealth of the city lies in the hands\nof the gentry: merchants and landowners who have\nbuilt their fortunes through centuries of hard work\nand clever investment. There are hundreds of powerful families in the City of Towers, but a few stand\nout from the rest. These are known as the Sixty.\n\nSharn was built with the gold of the [[ir'Tain family]], and today the ir'Tains are the most powerful and influential family in the city. Once at the end of each season,\nthey hold a grand party for the aristocracy—The [[Tain Gala]]. When the ir'Tains were building their new manor on [[Skyway]], Lady Shala told the architects\nto make the banquet hall large enough to seat sixty\nfamilies and their servants. The Sixty of [[Sharn]] are\nthose with standing invitations to the Tain Gala—the\nclear sign of success. It should be noted that other\npeople may attend the gala, as it is uncommon for\nall sixty families to bring all of their family members and servants, and the hall was designed to hold entertainers as well as guests. But a single invitation,\nwhile prestigious, is entirely different from being\ninvited to join the Sixty.\n\nWhile many members of the [[Aurum]] are also members of the Sixty, the two organizations are quite different. The Aurum is a highly organized conspiracy that carries out carefully orchestrated plans to provide its members with greater power and wealth. The Sixty is more of a social club—a visible manifestation of the most powerful families in Sharn.\nMembers of the Sixty discuss politics and business\nat the [[Tain Gala]]s, and these discussions can have an\nimpact on adventurers, [[Sharn]], or even [[Breland]]. But\nthe Sixty almost never act as a concerted unit, and\nmany members are actually bitter rivals beyond the\nwalls of the Tain Manor.\n\nAll of the noble families and the [[dragonmarked families|dragonmarked house]] are members of the Sixty; this means that\nany [[Sharn]] resident with the //ir'// or //d'// prefix on their\nlast name could be found at the [[Tain Gala]]. A standing invitation can always be\nrevoked to make room for a more deserving candidate; one of the greatest fears of Councilor [[Sorik Sensos]] is that his family will be displaced to make\nroom for Councilor [[Javan Tomollan]]. Just last year Celyria expelled the ir'Moros family and gave their place\nto [[Saidan Boromar]].\n\n!!
