The ancient walled monastery of Sulerred lies in the [[Shimmerwood Forest]], 50 miles southeast of the busy port of [[Trolanport]] in [[Zilargo]]. None of the monks of Sulerred are [[gnome]]s; at least, not anymore. 

The secret of of Sulerred Monastery, and the reason for its existence, is a banyan tree growing in its courtyard. A lattice of thick roots descending from the lower branches augments its trunkâ€”a remnant of the tree's early life when another, long-forgotten tree supported it. The descending roots of the Sulerred Calling Tree reform each spring into new patterns and symbols, which are recorded and celebrated every year on the Day of Calling, the [[20th day of Eyre|Khorvaire calendar]]. 

The monks study the strange twisted root symbols (which may be connected to the [[Draconic Prophecy]]), but their reverence for the tree is fueled primarily by its power to [[reincarnate]]. During the week before the Day of Calling, local inhabitants of the forest bring the remains of their recently deceased to the gates of Sulerred and hand them over to the monks. The locals camp outside the walls in a sort of mournful fairground, while the monks wash the bodies and lay them around the base of the Calling Tree. The monks begin a chant at dawn on the Day of Calling, while a few of them walk among the bodies, looking for signs of movement or change. One of these dead will magically [[reincarnate]] as a different [[humanoid]] race sometime between noon and sundown, after which they are given food, a monk's robe, and a forehead tattoo representing the newly formed root symbol under which they returned to life.

The reincarnated [[gnome]] leaves the gates in a new body and searches for their family among the crowds waiting in anticipation outside. It isn't unusual for a parent or child to recognize their revived loved one in new form and run to them, while others in the crowd face the realization that their family members are gone for good. The monks place the remaining bodies on a pyre outside the gate and burn them in a mass funeral at sundown the next day.

Although family members frequently try to convince the reincarnated to return home, most stay on at Sulerred as monks, wishing to tend and protect the tree that gave them new life.
