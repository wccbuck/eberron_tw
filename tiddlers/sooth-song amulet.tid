title: sooth-song amulet
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This amulet is a wide band of carved bone, threaded onto a necklace of braided twine. When swung in a fast circle on its necklace, this amulet emits a high-pitched sound that has a calming, soothing effect on creatures that hear it. It reduces anger, fear, and other forms of agitation, magical or natural. The stronger the emotion, however, the less likely the creature is to be calmed.
