Embers is the center of the [[Thrane]] presence in [[Stormreach]]. Its residents keep to themselves for the most
part, united by their [[faith|Silver Flame]] and by a desire to make
their home a refuge from the wildness in so much of
the city. Even the Thrane dissidents here retain much
of their national pride and dedicate themselves to
the neighborhoodâ€™s welfare. If anyone tries to cause
trouble in the ward, the [[Knights of Thrane]], led by
[[Valen Vanatar]], do not stand for it.

The [[Candlelight]] is one of the best restaurants in Embers.
