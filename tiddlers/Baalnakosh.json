Within the compound are facilities for all the needs of the [[Inspired]] ruler, as well as a [[monolith|hanbalani alta]] for his personal use. Baalnakosh's palace is kept comfortable throughout the year by the power of the monolith, but the hashalaq sometimes uses the hanbalan for other purposes.",
