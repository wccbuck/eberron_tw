The peryton is a bizarre creature that blends the body and wings of a bird of prey with the head of a stag. Its strangest feature is its shadow, which appears [[humanoid]] rather than reflecting the creature's physical form. Sages postulate that the first perytons were [[human]]s or [[elves|elf]] transformed by a hideous curse or magical experiment, but [[bard]]s tell a different tale of a man whose infidelity caused his scorned wife to cut out the heart of her younger, more beautiful rival and consume it in a ritual intended to forever win her husband's heart. The ritual succeeded until the woman's villainy was exposed. She was hanged for her crime, but the lingering magic of her foul ritual caused the carrion birds that feasted on her corpse to transform into the first perytons. Whatever the truth, perytons can understand [[Sylvan]] and perhaps [[Common]] or [[Aerenese]], but cannot speak.

Perytons roost atop mountain ridges and lair in high caves. They prey on creatures living or wandering in the vales below, and travelers on lonely mountain roads learn to keep a wary eye on the sky. Because non-magical weapons are less effective against perytons, the folk of the mountains know to avoid confrontations with these monsters at all costs.
