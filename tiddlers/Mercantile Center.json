The center is divided\ninto sections, showcasing textiles, glassworks, medicinal\nsupplies, and foodstuffs. Basic goods—tools, beasts of burden, and such—can also be purchased at the mercantile center. Weapons and armor are not available; one must deal with the [[Dream Merchants]] to obtain contraband.\n\nThe ''Jhodra Inn'' can be found here, a simple inn which provides [[Riedran cuisine|Riedrans]] and sparse dormitory lodging. It's austere,\nbut inexpensive compared to the [[Gold Dragon Inn]]. Private rooms are not available.",
