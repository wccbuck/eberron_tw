Their traditions focus on ceramics, glass, chandlery, and cooking. They focus their efforts on the transformation of the domestic sphere, rather than the world at largeâ€”but their interpretation of the [[Traveler's Curse]] is that of a traveler who lacks a home to return to, and in some sense, their project is to make the continent of [[Xen'drik]] into that home. \n\nHearth Promise communities tend to be small and tranquil, and are renowned as houses of healing by [[Sulatu]] and other locals. Many Hearth Promise Sulatu were born in other [[drow]] cultures, coming to the Promise of Fire as a shelter from the trials of the Shattered Land.",
