        "text": "The Crown Knights of [[Thrane]] is a chivalric order which pledged to defend crown and country when it was established during the time of Governor-Prince [[Thrane Wynarn]], son of King [[Galifar I|Galifar Wynarn]]. Over the centuries, this order of knights has served the regents of Thrane faithfully. Early in the [[Last War]], when the Church of the [[Silver Flame]] refused to acknowledge the authority of the crown after the death of King [[Thalin ir'Wynarn]]\nand transformed the nation into a theocracy, the Knights of Thrane were ready to battle on behalf of the crown. But Daslin, the heir apparent, defused the situation by bowing to the [[Keeper of the Flame]], realizing that Thrane would be destroyed if it succumbed to internal strife while the Last War raged on. Today, the Crown Knights continue to work for the nation, serving Queen [[Diani|Diani ir'Wynarn]] in name but answering to the [[Council of Cardinals]] in practice. As opposed to the [[templar]]s, who are devoted to the [[Silver Flame]]'s mission of combating supernatural evil, the Crown Knights have always been more concerned with mundane threats.\n\nThe Crown Knights are led by Captain [[Malik Otherro]].\n\nA contingent of Crown Knights refused to serve the theocracy after [[Thalin|Thalin ir'Wynarn]]'s death, and exiled themselves to [[Stormreach]]. Today they are a [[militia]] known simply as the [[Knights of Thrane]].",
