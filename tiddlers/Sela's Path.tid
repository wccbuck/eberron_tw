House [[Lyrandar]] maintains its own
priesthood, venerating [[Arawai]], [[Kol Korran]], and the
house’s founders Lyran and Selavash. Those who
follow Sela’s Path believe that Arawai and Kol Korran
sent Lyran and Selavash their [[dragonmark]]s to bring
unity and prosperity to the [[half-elf]] people.
