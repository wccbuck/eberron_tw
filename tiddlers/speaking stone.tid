title: speaking stone
tooltip: long-distance communication technology operated by House Sivis
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The key to long-distance, virtually instantaneous communication across [[Khorvaire]] is House [[Sivis]]'s network of message stations. Each station contains at least one speaking stone, which is carved from a Siberys [[dragonshard]] and inscribed with arcane symbols that uniquely identify it. If you're a [[gnome]] with the [[Mark of Scribing]], you can touch the stone and send a short message from it (about 25 words or less; or, if compressed, up to 50 words; as the [[sending]] spell). The target is any other speaking stone whose location or unique sequence of symbols you know. A creature within 5 feet of the stone hears the message as if they were the target.

In a Sivis message station, a gnome is always on duty by the speaking stone, listening for messages that might come in and transcribing them for delivery to their intended recipients.
