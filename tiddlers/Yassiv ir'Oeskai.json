        "text": "Countess [[Yassiv ir'Oeskai]] provides the city watch for [[Xandrar]] and administers the surrounding lands. The countess spends most of her time at her mansion within the city rather than at [[Drum Keep]], the primary garrison of her holdings. She and Mayor [[Garrit|Garrit Tomraan]] of [[Xandrar]] hold wildly different opinions on the “[[Swords of Liberty]] problem” that has infested the region in recent months, but generally manage to work together to keep the city from being burned to the ground.\n\nYassiv has some sympathy for the pro-democracy goals of the [[Swords of Liberty]], and rumors persist that she once adventured with [[Red Owl]], the legendary leader of the area’s Swords of Liberty cell. Garrit, meanwhile, has no patience for the destructive tactics of the Swords and the suffering Red Owl has personally brought to innocents while\ntrying to strike out against the monarchy.",
