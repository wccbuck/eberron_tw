[[The Reavers of Harkenwold]]

!!! Session 13

Arien owes Roak 3c. After buying her [[benevolent armor]] (medium) she has 1c left.

Horse that Arien rents: Adagio

Arien fails the roll for getting past the Municipal Guard. They definitely warn the Iron Circle folks who will be keeping an eye out for her.

Earlene's Plight: Arien caused the fellas' torches to flare into their faces then extinguish. The dog started running towards her. Arien spoke with the horse to calm it, but it still freaked out and bolted. She also spoke to the dog and convinced it to back off. The brigands started to take aim with their crossbows, but Arien closed the distance. She eventually intimidated all three dudes into fleeing.

Mallard: change to Happy Mallard

Stopped right before making our way to Tor's Hold. Definitely have some Iron Circle guys stop her on the road.
