title: heavy hand manacles
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

These restraints are designed to prevent
[[arcane|arcane magic]] spellcasters from casting spells, while still allowing them to use their hands for simple tasks such as eating.

At a glance, heavy hand manacles look like the
arms from a suit of plate mail: steel gauntlets
and thick sheathes for the forearm and upper
arm, bound together with chains lashed across
the front and back of the wearerâ€™s torso. Additional chains connect the elbows and wrists,
preventing the wearer form moving their arms
more than 18 inches apart. Altogether, the manacles weigh 15 pounds.

Heavy hands provide a bit of armored protection to the wearer, but impose a [[disadvantage]] on any action involving quick or precise use of the wearer's hands, and two [[disadvantage]]s for casting spells with a somatic component (i.e. requiring some kind of gesture).
