        "text": "The Frenzy is a psychic curse that can take root in a person who travels through the [[Realm Below]] beneath the [[Ironroot Mountains]]. A victim of the Frenzy immediately is compelled to pursue a course of action that leads to violence. Some retain enough self-control to seek out an existing enemy; others simply turn on the closest creature that annoys them. If someone cursed by the Frenzy strikes another creature with a melee attack, the target must resist the psychic curse or contract the Frenzy. If someone kills a victim of the Frenzy, they are also at risk of infection themselves. \n\nThe Frenzy can be blocked by any effect that prevents a victim from being charmed by an [[aberration]], or removed instantly by the [[greater restoration|restoration]] spell. Otherwise, if a victim is restrained and prevented from acting on their violent impulses, they may overcome the Frenzy after a few hours. ",
