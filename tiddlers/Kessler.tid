type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

//A handsome, slender [[gnome]] with light skin and sharp features, Kessler often wears a beautiful suit of red and black [[glamerweave]]. A sporty black cap hides his short dark hair, and his beard and mustache are carefully trimmed and waxed. His deep blue eyes study everything around him and he laughs merrily. //

Kessler is known across [[Breland]] and [[Zilargo]] for his
razor wit and lyrical skill, performing solo or taking
the staring role in performances staged by playhouses
and theater groups. His satirical work //The Battle of the Five Ducks//—a comedy skewering the rulers of the [[Five Nations]]—is among the best-selling books of the last
century. While his sharp words have earned him
many enemies in high places, his charisma and quick
wits have made him a fixture at gatherings of the elite
and powerful. Kessler is a brilliant and insightful man, but he is completely fearless and will criticize anyone or anything. While he is remarkably intelligent, he is a consummate hedonist; in addition to fine food, wine, and music, he enjoys the company of
women of all races and has recently become addicted
to [[dreamlily]]. Kessler has no ties to any organization;
he has been approached by the [[Trust]] ([[Zilargo]]'s secret
order of spies and assassins) on many occasions, but
he has an independent mind and has no interest in
chaining himself to a higher power.

''Adventure Idea:'' Adventurers often perform
questionable actions. Perhaps a party accidentally desecrates a shrine, is caught breaking into the house of
a noble, or otherwise has fate turn against them. The
consequences aren't that serious—until Kessler seizes
on the subject for his latest satire, a work examining
the danger presented by adventurers. Suddenly the
party is the laughingstock of [[Sharn]]. Former associates
don't want to be seen with them, merchants raise their
prices, and it's only a matter of time before word of
Kessler's new act spreads across [[Breland]] and into the
other nations. Can the party find a way to straighten
things out with the gnome?
