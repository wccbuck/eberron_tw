''Population:'' <<ntls>>

By far the largest city in the [[Eldeen Reaches]], Varna serves as the gateway for commerce with the world beyond. Reacher merchants come from far and wide to sell their goods in the markets of Varna. All the [[dragonmarked house]]s have
outposts in Varna, but as the ancestral seat of House
[[Vadalis]] it houses their largest [[enclave]], [[Foalswood]]. Varna has also become home to the excesses of all larger centers, particularly a thriving black market where
poachers and trappers smuggle rare plants and animals into [[Aundair]] and beyond.

A notable feature of the
city is Hunterâ€™s Grove, an enormous temple dedicated
to the Sovereign Lord [[Balinor]], the patron deity of
House [[Vadalis]]. Just outside Varna is the [[Vadalis]]-run Willowhaven Ranch, the largest dairy farm in the [[Five Nations]].
