They are dedicated in their task of hunting and eliminating all [[giant]]s from the continent and from Eberron as a whole. Unlike their brethren, they do not have a solitary focus on the scorpion god [[Vulkoor]]; they revere the scorpion, but also other primal animalistic spirits, such as the [[Shifting Panther|displacer beast]], the [[tilxin]], and a host of other totems.",
