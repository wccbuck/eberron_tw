Their name translates to \"Broken Oath.\" They are dedicated in their task of hunting and eliminating all [[giant]]s from the continent and from Eberron as a whole; their [[scorpion wraith]] champions are legendary. The Qaltiar are also driven by an ancient vendetta against the [[Sulatar]] drow.\n\nUnlike their brethren, they do not have a solitary focus on the scorpion god [[Vulkoor]]; they revere the scorpion, but also other primal animalistic spirits, such as ''Hul'drac'', the [[Shifting Panther|displacer beast]]; ''Kura'tra'', the [[tilxin]]; ''Ko'molaq'', the immense two-headed serpent spirit who possesses knowledge of hidden things; and a host of other totems.
