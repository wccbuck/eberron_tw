        "text": "The Consuming Storm is an [[overlord]] of the [[Age of Demons]], a fiendish and malefic embodiment of nature's wrath. It is the maelstrom that swallows ships whole, the tsunami that shatters coastal villages, the gale wind that can pluck a mast from a vessel as easily as a child would pull the wing off an insect. Scholars of the first age believe this overlord may be bound within [[Tempest Isle]] in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], where even as it slumbers, its mere presence is enough to generate the never-ending storm from which the island takes its name.\n\nWhen it was unbound, the Consuming Storm was unlike most [[overlord]]s in that its power wasn't constrained to a single region; it would travel across [[Eberron]], triggering earthquakes and eruptions, taking joy in destroying the holdings of the other overlords but never lingering for long. Surely this archfiend inspired many of the myths of the [[Devourer]], though unlike the domain of the Sovereign of Wave and Whelm, there is nothing natural about the Consuming Storm's malevolence.",
