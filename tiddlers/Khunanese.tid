Khunanese (also known as "Caleshazi") was the language spoken by the pre-[[Sundering]] [[Sarlona]]n kingdom of [[Khunan]], and was a trade language used throughout all of [[Syrkarn]], [[Rhiavhaar]], [[Caleshaz]], [[Borunan]], and parts of western [[Adar]] and southern [[Nulakaz]]. Despite its common name, the language actually originated in [[Caleshaz]], and spread to Khunan during the Caleshazi crusades. Pieces of the language live on in many modern languages, including the [[Common]] tongue of [[Khorvaire]]. Others include [[Syrk]], [[Adaran]], [[Lhazaaran]], and [[Argon]].

The [[Common]] word [[couatl]] originated in the Khunanese language.
