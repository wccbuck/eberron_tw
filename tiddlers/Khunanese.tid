Khunanese was the language spoken by the pre-[[Sundering]] [[Sarlona]]n kingdom of [[Khunan]], which spread to all of [[Syrkarn]], [[Rhiavhaar]], and even into [[Adar]], [[Khalesh]], and southern [[Borunan]]. Pieces of the language live on in many modern languages, including the [[Common]] tongue of [[Khorvaire]]. Others include [[Syrk]], [[Adaran]], [[Lhazaaran]], and [[Argon]].
