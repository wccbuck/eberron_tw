Food and other perishable items do not age or decay while inside a //chest of preserving//. The chest is 2½ feet long, 1½ feet wide, and 1 foot tall with a half-barrel lid. The chest has a lock, which can be picked with [[thieves' tools]]. Smashing the lock or any other part of the chest renders it nonmagical.
