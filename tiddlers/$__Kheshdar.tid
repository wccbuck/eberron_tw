''Prerequisite:'' [[goblinoid]] (either [[Goblin/Kobold (talent)]], [[Hobgoblin (talent)]], or [[Bugbear (talent)]])

I’m a spy serving the [[Silent Folk|Khesh'dar]]. The
[[Dhakaani clans|Heirs of Dhakaan]] have been in hiding for thousands of years, but now they’re preparing to return. The Khesh’dar sell their services to
all the [[clans|kech]]. For now, what they want most
is information about the surface world. I may
receive missions from my controller, but I’m
always watching for interesting information
they could use.

//Was I born into the [[Khesh'dar]] or recruited by them? How do I communicate with my controller?//

''GM Notes: ''The [[Khesh'dar]] are traditionally //golin’dar//
(Dhakaani [[goblin]]s). If the character is a //ghaal’dar//
(Dhakaani [[hobgoblin]]), //guul’dar// (Dhakaani
[[bugbear]]), or even a non-Dhakaani [[goblinoid]],
this would be very unusual, though that may make them a valued asset. In general, the Khesh’dar need information, but the character could be given missions that serve the goals of a particular [[Dhakaani clan|kech]]. Such missions should add a challenge to an adventure—kill a specific person, plant an object, learn a secret—but shouldn’t place the character in direct opposition to the goals of the other adventurers.
