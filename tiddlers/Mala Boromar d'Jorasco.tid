Mala Boromar d'Jorasco is an unmarked heir of House [[Jorasco]], and
her marriage to [[Saidan Boromar]] has formed important ties between the crime lord and the healers of [[Sharn]]. Jorasco healers help [[Boromar|Boromar Clan]] [[halfling]]s free of charge, with the expectation that Saidan will reimburse them for their efforts; this emergency assistance has saved the lives of many Boromars ambushed and left for dead by [[Daask]] brigands.
