Gilead Rhoy, a former [[Brelish|Breland]] noble, leads a group of [[cleric]]s and warriors in [[Stormreach]] known as Gilead's Flock, under the umbrella of the [[Covenant of Light]]. This group is tasked with locating and sheltering potential Covenant recruits when they
arrive in Stormreach.

Gilead is a highly charismatic man with an aura of genuine peace and serenity about
him. He has proven to have an uncanny ear for hearing the Song within others and guiding them to their proper role within the [[Covenant|Covenant of Light]]. When Gilead first arrived in [[Stormreach]], he was abducted by the [[Cabal of Shadows]] and held prisoner for several days before the Covenant rescued him from a chamber deep beneath the city. No one knows the full story of
what happened to Gilead at that
time, but he lost the use of his legs
permanently—no healing magic
has been able to mend him. Gilead
now makes his way around the city
on a small (5-foot-by-5-foot) [[carpet of flying]]—a gift from an anonymous
benefactor. This experience inspired Gilead to actively
seek out and protect new disciples for the Covenant.

Gilead is accompanied at all times by his two most trusted companions and friends: [[Boorne]] and [[Leahtari]].
