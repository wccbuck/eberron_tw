        "text": "The Old Bones, a gang in [[Graywall]], are veteran [[Karrnath]]i soldiers—\npatriots and fanatical followers of the [[Blood of Vol]]. However, they are not members of the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]]; they have concluded that the leaders\nof the Emerald Claw are not truly devoted to the\nprinciples of the Blood of Vol, nor do they have the\nbest interests of [[Karrnath]] at heart. They dream of\nsome day driving the treacherous [[Kaius III|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] from\nthe throne and simultaneously cleansing the ranks\nof the Seekers.\n\nAlthough their goals might appeal to Karrns, the Old Bones are not virtuous champions. Many of them are war criminals who are wanted for acts of extraordinary cruelty during the [[Last War]]. The [[dwarf]] [[cleric]] ''Cayna'' is infamous for slaughtering prisoners of war so that she could raise them as [[undead]] soldiers, and the gang's [[human]] leader ''Zaris Lornath'' ordered many attacks on civilian populations. The Old Bones believe in terror as a tool and [[necromancy]] as a weapon, and they stop at nothing to ensure Karrnathi supremacy. The Old Bones could be allies against the [[Emerald Claw]], but they are disturbing allies at best.\n\nIt’s up to the GM to decide just how powerful Zaris and Cayna are. Their greatest ally is ''Desh Anarn'', a fallen champion of the [[Blood of Vol]] returned as a sentient skeletal guardian. The circumstances that allowed Anarn to return with such power remain\na mystery; this could be due to his great faith in the Blood of Vol, or he could be a creation of [[Lady Illmarrow]]—a spy sent to watch this splinter group to see if it can be used.",
