        "text": "House [[Cannith]] has a long history with [[Cyre]], and\ncenturies ago, the house was granted one of the\nseven [[Vermishards]] of [[Metrol]]. While officially named the\nVermishard of Steel, it was commonly known as the\nForge in the latter days of the [[Last War]]. Many of the Forgeâ€™s most important facilities lie below ground. The spire that rises above the city contains vaults of wonders\nproduced over the ages, along with barracks for the\nmany [[magewright]]s and artisans that worked in the\ndepths. The top of the Vermishard was the Palace of the\nGorgon, the personal domain of [[Starrin d'Cannith]], now deceased.",
