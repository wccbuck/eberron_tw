title: Everice
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

At the world's poles—Everice to the south and the [[Frostfell]] to the north—you might...

* Discover an ancient civilization hidden beneath the ice.
* Search for the survivors of a lost expedition.
*  Find the source of a mysterious mystical signal.

It's common knowledge that Everice is the domain of
the [[Queen of Winter]], an [[archfey]] who commands a host
of winter wolves and knights carved from living ice. The
queen lives in a glacial palace, and those who overcome
her guards and the deadly weather to earn her favor can
gain powerful boons.

It's also common knowledge that Everice is the home
of [[frost giant]]s who escaped the destruction of [[Xen'drik]].
Now they hone their arctic magic and plot vengeance.
However, a clan of [[white dragon]]s battle the [[giant]]s to
keep them from growing too powerful. Woe betide the
people of [[Khorvaire]] if dragon and giant ever set aside
their ancient vendetta and join forces!

Mystery shrouds the poles of [[Eberron]]. A few expeditions have ventured to the [[Frostfell]], but no one from
[[Khorvaire]] has set foot in Everice in living memory and
returned to speak of it.

!! The Poles' Influence in Khorvaire

In [[Khorvaire]], you might...

* Clash with a cabal of winter [[warlock]]s serving a sinister power stirring in Everice.
* Encounter a group of frost [[giant]]s or [[Frostfell]] dwarves establishing a foothold in [[Khorvaire]].
* Discover a journal from a Frostfell expedition that reveals a horrifying threat.

The people of Khorvaire have no commerce with the
arctic regions and no certainty about what lives there. If
a threat comes from Everice, it might take time for people to identify its origin.

With this in mind, relics from Everice or the Frostfell
could take any form. Are these treasures created by [[giant]]s, [[fey]], or [[dwarves|dwarf]]? Are they carved from eternal ice,
or are they forged from dwarven steel?
