Not all criminals in [[Fairhaven]] employ theft, blackmail, or trickery. Some simply seize what they want with brute force—or with the aid of a blazing crossbow. Staunch, a crippled [[warforged]] [[artificer]] and former artillerist of the [[Aundair]]ian Army, is just such
an individual. Embittered by his injuries and less than appreciative for what he considers “inadequate compensation,” he now hires himself out to anyone with a bone to pick with the Aundairian crown. Staunch usually serves as his employers’ armorer or sometimes as a head of operations for whatever mercenary grunts they retain. 

Staunch’s lower left leg was destroyed by some
eldritch device of [[Cyran|Cyre]] design during the [[Last War]].
No [[artificer]], [[wizard]], or [[magewright]] has ever been
able to repair or replace it, so he’s built a harness
around the stump with an enchanted wheel attached.
This repurposing has given Staunch a slow, distinctive gait. But for this unforgivable slight, he is delighted by the destruction of [[Cyre]] and openly mocks its survivors. Staunch’s
nihilist worldview has made him resistant to intimidation and unafraid of death.

Staunch shies from no fight. He was forged for war
and fully expects to meet oblivion in one. He uses
his customized armbow to launch fiery bolts or blast
opponents with an incendiary spray. When not surrounded by his employers’ goons,
Staunch shares the company of likeminded [[warforged]] unsatisfied with sovereign authority. Many have even defected from the organized service of the [[Lord of Blades]].

!! Adventure Hook: Contending with Staunch

Parties willing to treat with criminals might be
able to hire Staunch, though his price is exorbitant.
Employing this belligerent [[warforged]] is an ordeal
in itself. He is not content to take casual orders from
anyone, especially not breathers. As a [[construct]] and a
nihilist, he respects only power, magic, and material
wealth; spiritualism or higher ideals mean nothing to
him. Most characters will encounter Staunch in their
enemy’s service, overseeing the heavy lifting of some
deadly operation, and will probably exchange arrowfire before words. But... he can //always// be bought.
