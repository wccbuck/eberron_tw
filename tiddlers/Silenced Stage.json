        "text": "Subsidized by House [[Phiarlan]], this playhouse specializes in works that have been banned in the [[Five Nations]], along with new creations of exiled and expatriate artists. It is one of the major tourist draws in [[Graywall]], since people travel from [[Fairhaven]], [[Flamekeep]], and [[Korth]] to see these forbidden performances. The luminaries of the company include Laren Devir, a [[Brelish|Breland]] playwright known for his antimonarchy rhetoric; [[half-elf]] [[Asta Brand]], a [[Karrnath]]i singer-songwriter whose opera “Army of the Damned” is a bitter condemnation of both the [[Code of Kaius]] and the Karrnathi use of [[undead soldiers|Karrnathi undead]]; and Syro Talandro, a [[changeling]]\nfrom [[Thrane]] renowned for his solo performances and his explorations of the dark side of the Church of the [[Silver Flame]].\n\n[[Asta Brand]] is the founder of the company; if any of the PCs have artistic talent, Asta might seek to employ them in a performance at the Silenced Stage.",
