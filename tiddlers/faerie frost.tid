type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

One of the most perilous of [[Everice]]'s magical dangers, faerie frost resembles an ice sheet with a faint rosy hue. Creatures who remain in a region of faerie frost for 1 minute or more become subject to its deadly hallucinatory curse. If a creature cannot resist the mind-affecting compulsion effect, they become dazed and disoriented, experiencing euphoric delusions of warm temperatures and inviting flowery meadows. These creatures might sit or lie down on the ice, comfortably oblivious as they slowly freeze to death.
