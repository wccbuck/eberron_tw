This armor features [[Sun]] motifs and a brilliant sheen. The wearer of this armor can cause it to glow as brightly as a torch, shedding bright [[sunlight|Sun]] in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, at will; they can also suppress this light at will. In addition, once per day, the wearer can command the armor to glow much brighter, shedding bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet, for up to 30 minutes (or until suppressed).
