Sahuagin is the language spoken by the "[[sea devils|sahuagin]]" of the [[Thunder Sea]], and is the official language of the [[Eternal Dominion]]. Tribes of [[sahuagin]] in other seas of the world typically speak other languages. The language has loan words from [[Primordial]], as well as a few from [[Abyssal]]. Many non-sahuagin sailors who travel between [[Sharn]] and [[Stormreach]] know at least a few words in Sahuagin; if anything, they know how to curse in it.
