type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

On the edge of [[Fairhaven]]'s [[Sovereign Ward]], and in view of
the city’s largest temples, is a stately manor belonging
to the noble ir’Uvanto family. This old [[Aundair]]ian
family lost most of its fortunes, its holdings, and its
children during the [[Last War]], and has struggled
ever since to maintain both reputation and a high
standard of living. The nobles make their living now
by selling a vast collection of gems, jewelry, and
//objets d’art//, many of which have been looted from the
family’s own mausoleums. The gallery itself, known
as ir’Uvanto Family Antiquities, occupies the ground
floor of the manor and is open to the public.

!! Claws in the Dark

Bitterness and desperation
drove the family’s patriarch, Arvos ir’Uvanto, to
betray his country by accepting an offer he couldn’t
refuse: His estate has now become a safe house for
the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]]. With a hidden cell
operating in the very shadow of [[Fairhold]], agents of the
Order work to insinuate themselves in the city’s more
esteemed institutions and network with its criminals.
Not all members of the ir’Uvanto family approve of
the Order’s presence, but the most reluctant have
been silenced by savage threats. Still, if any of these
sent out a servant to find help, they might be willing
to talk if they could be guaranteed protection.
