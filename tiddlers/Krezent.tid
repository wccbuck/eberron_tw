Krezent is an ancient fortress-citadel from the [[Age of Demons]], established by the [[couatl]] during their million-year war with the [[overlord]]s, and is possibly the last couatl fortress on Eberron. It is located on the edge of the [[Blade Desert]] in the [[Talenta Plains]], and it extends down into the depths of [[Khyber]], where powerful [[fiend]]s from that ancient conflict are bound.

Today, the [[halfling]]s of the plains shun the fortress and the surrounding area, believing it to be cursed. In truth, it is still inhabited by the [[shulatlaca]], [[couatl]]-like [[human]]s who tend the ancient city and keep intruders at bay. 

Krezent is a place built by celestial beings at the height of their power; despite being in ruins, the citadel still has divine tools that magically create food and water and protect its inhabitants from disease.

The shulatlaca guardians may have originated from [[human]] adepts who revered the [[couatl]]s, slowly transforming into feathered snakefolk over the millennia since the arrival of [[Lhazaar]]. Alternatively, they may have arrived in Krezent only a few hundred years ago, emerging from a [[demiplane]] stronghold they seized in a past age.
