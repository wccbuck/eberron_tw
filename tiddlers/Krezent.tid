Krezent is an ancient fortress-citadel from the [[Age of Demons]], established by the [[couatl]] during their million-year war with the [[overlord]]s, and is possibly the last couatl fortress on Eberron. It is located on the edge of the [[Blade Desert]] in the [[Talenta Plains]], and it extends down into the depths of [[Khyber]], where powerful [[fiend]]s from that ancient conflict are bound.

Today, the [[halfling]]s of the plains shun the fortress and the surrounding area, believing it to be cursed. In truth, it is still inhabited by the [[shulassakar]], [[couatl]]-like [[human]]s who tend the ancient city and keep intruders at bay.
