Psions are the quintessential manifesters of [[psionic power|psionics]]. Psions unleash the potential locked within every conscious mind, move objects with just a thought, and assume command of even the least desire of their foes. Psions make manifest their secret wishes when others can only dream.

These masters of mental manipulation might come by their psionics through meditation or careful study of the [[plane]] of [[Dal Quor]], or perhaps their power manifested as a [[wilder]], a sudden aberrant mental mutation sparked by a planar flare from [[Xoriat]]. 
Psions can most commonly be found among the [[Inspired]] and [[kalashtar]] of [[Sarlona]].

Most psions have basic telepathy and short-range telekinesis, but at least three specializations of psion exist:

* ''Telepaths'' are able to link their mind to those of other conscious creatures. While this can be a useful tool for fostering communication and fellowship, a psion that focuses on this discipline can wield their telepathy like a weapon. Through mesmerism and manipulation, powerful telepaths called dominators mold weaker minds like clay. Powerful manipulators who can control several minds at once are known as [[thrallherd]]s.
* ''Kineticists'' are experts in the mental manipulation of energy. They wield precise, powerful, and long-range telekinetic control, but also use their psionic discipline to control flames, ice, lightning, or even sound.
* ''Shapers'' are masters of metacreativity, the ability to form solid and semisolid objects such as tools, weapons, and even [[construct|conjure astral construct]]s out of psionic ectoplasm. These objects only last a limited time, but the creative possibilities are limitless. 
* ''Clairsentients'' learn secrets long forgotten, glimpse the immediate future and predict the far future, find hidden objects, and know what is normally unknowable.
