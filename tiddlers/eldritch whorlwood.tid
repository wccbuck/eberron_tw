Eldritch whorlwood is a rare gnarled wood found in the jungles of [[Xen'drik]]. The twists in the wood are caused by the intrinsic magical power trapped in the wood. When used to make wands or staffs, [[spell]]s cast from the [[implement|magical implement]] can release some of this power, causing the wood to gradually untwist. When it is perfectly straight, the magic is expended.
