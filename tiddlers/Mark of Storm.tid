<div style="float: left; width: 100px;">{{$:/plugins/wccbuck/storm.svg}}</div> Wind and water welcome the half-elves who carry the
Mark of Storm, and some learn to call on the power of
the storm itself. Bearers can resist the elements and endure lightning strikes, command the wind and sea, and with the assistance of [[dragonshard]] focus items, pilot [[airship]]s and [[elemental galleon]]s.

Only a [[half-elf]] with ties to House [[Lyrandar]] can manifest this [[dragonmark]].
