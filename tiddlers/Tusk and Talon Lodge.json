        "text": "The Tusk and Talon Lodge, a nondescript building\nfacing [[Coldwake Pond]] in [[Respite]], is the den of the [[Lords of the Hunt]]. Here, the cabal of trophy hunters swap stories, show off their kills, and sharpen\ntheir weapons. The greatest hunters in [[Xen'drik]]\ngather at the Lodge, and nonmembers of the Lords are not\ngranted admittance lightly. PCs who wish to petition\nfor membership must prove their worth. The Lords judge candidates for\nmembership on their skills, their kills, and their zeal\nfor the hunt. Every Lord lives for the Hunt and little\nelse. Outside interests, whether religious, political, or\nbusiness-related, that overshadow any hunter’s commitment to the constant search for ferocious specimens might earn excommunication from the Lords.\nRumors suggest that an ancient shrine to [[Banor the Bloody Spear|Rushemé]] rests beneath the Tusk and Talon Lodge, and that the Lords hold secret services on the eve of\nhunts and offer up trophies to the [[giant]] deity upon their return. The Lords dismiss this as nothing more than inane conjecture.",
