        "text": "''District Type:'' Marketplace and shops<br/>\n''Buildings:'' Open-air market, temple ([[Sovereign Host]]), shrines (the [[Keeper]], [[Kol Korran]]), average\nlodging (24), average food (85), exotic trades (30),\nupscale trades (60), average trades (300), poor trades\n(110), upscale services (20), average services (100),\npoor services (40)<br/>\n''First Impression:'' The crowd and noise of this\ndistrict are overwhelming. In addition to the shops\nand stalls, the streets are full of people offering\nquestionable goods and deals; it seems like everyone has something to sell. The [[Watch|Sharn Watch]] maintains a\nstrong presence in the Bazaar, but they are more\nconcerned with preventing riots than in stopping\ntrade of illegal goods.<br/>\n''Social Class:'' Lower class<br/>\n''Neighbors:'' [[Underlook]] (west); [[Hareth's Folly]] (northeast); [[Stormhold]] (southwest); [[Callestan]] (below); [[Redstone]] (above)\n\nThe Bazaar of [[Dura]], the largest commercial district in [[Sharn]], sprawls out across a dozen towers.\nThe towers around the edges are devoted to shops\nand services. Almost anything can be found in this\ndistrict, though the quality of any particular item or\nservice cannot be guaranteed. At the center of the\ndistrict, the open market from which the district\ntakes its name presents a labyrinth of shops, tents,\nand makeshift stalls set up in the middle of the\nstreet. A marketplace permit costs only [[0.1c|money]], though\nmany people try to avoid even this paltry sum. However, guards who catch such shirkers usually extort\nfar larger sums in exchange for a pass.\n\nOf the four markets of Sharn, the Bazaar has the\nhighest concentration of criminal activity—illegal\nservices and trades, as well as pickpockets, bullies, and\ncon artists. These services are not as obvious as they\nare in [[Lower Dura]] or the [[Cogs]], and quality and prices\nare not as good, but shopping here is generally safer\nthan venturing to the lawless lower ward. The cost\nof illegal services should be increased by 25%. The\n[[Boromar Clan]] controls most of the illegal activities,\nbut [[Daask]] has been pressing up from below, and those\nseeking services may be caught in the middle.\n\nIf an adventuring party displays obvious wealth—\nif they are spreading gold around, wearing [[glamerweave]] or impressive magic armor or clothes—they\nmust deal with a constant stream of pleading beggars\nand con artists. Pickpockets pose a constant threat,\nand bullies try to lure shoppers into ambushes. When\ndoing business in the Bazaar, it's best to conceal\nyour wealth.\n\nThe Bazaar is a good place to dispose of random\nacquisitions. Stolen goods aside (those requiring an\nactual fence), most items can be sold here for 45%\nof their actual value. \n\nAlmost any sort of mundane item can be found at\nthe Bazaar, including [[alchemical|alchemist]] goods. A merchant\nmight even have a few [[magic item]]s in stock, or at\nleast items that he claims are magical. Any magic or\nmasterwork items found in the Bazaar are certainly\nsecondhand, and might have a dubious or intriguing history. \n\n!! Noteworthy Locations\n\n* [[Caerlyn's Blade]]. A troop of [[Valenar]] mercenaries that calls itself Caerlyn's Blade uses the Bazaar as a base of operations.\n* The [[Shrine of the Keeper]]. [[Gellis Candar]]'s pawn shop has a hidden back room with a shrine to the [[Keeper]], the [[Dark Six]] god of death and greed.\n* [[Vundry's Curios]]. A pawnshop and well-connected fence for illegal or illegally obtained goods.\n* A [[Sivis]] [[message station|speaking stone]] in Barmin Tower, near the edge of the district.",
