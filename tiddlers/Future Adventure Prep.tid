title: Future Adventure Prep
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This is for sketching out adventures many sessions away. See [[Adventures of Arien]] for more imminent session prep.

[[Old Session Prep]]

!! Starilaskur

Quest: invisible [[boggle]]s are leading victims (children?) to an [[annis hag]].

As Arien's powers grow, the mentor/teachers at the Martial Temple are confused at the way her powers manifest, and come to believe that her power comes primarily from the [[Silver Flame]], not from [[Dol Arrah]]. So they recommend she travel to [[Thrane]] for training.

!! Thrane

Eventually, she realizes her power comes from a [[celestial]] of [[Fernia]], whose physical form was destroyed 20 years ago, and a sliver of that angel's power landed in Arien's soul. This leads her to seek out other planetouched folks, which leads her to the town of [[Rellekor]]. Here she meets with learned [[tiefling]]s who can reveal more of what's going on. Maybe here she meets a tiefling named Zaben who was touched by a fragment of a Fernian fiend in the same way Arien was.

!! Sharn

Eventually Arien goes to [[Sharn]] because of course. Maybe she is sent there to check in with Archierophant [[Ythana Morr]] at the [[Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame]]. Could be the start to some cool adventures. But when she's there, she needs a way to make money; joins [[Clifftop Adventurers' Guild]]. Do the "Sharn chicken" scene from Fired and Forgotten. 

Do the Delirium Stone adventure at some point, presumably as [[Aehion Hanius Hayttear]] has hired the Clifftop guild to recover the stone. When Arien goes back in time, she's in the "Burn" character's body, but she's not named "Burn" because that's dumb. Instead, her past character is name is "Gudhrin". (Means "burning hot" in old tolkien "Gnomish".)
