!! Starilaskur

[[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]]

[[Sejra Whitebinder]]

When taking her oath: What would it take for you to break it?

* What if it no longer aligns with your goals?
* What if keeping it would cause harm to innocent people?

"Religious Order" from E:RftLW, adopted a bit

<<<
You act in the service of [[Starilaskur]]'s prestigious [[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]], pursuing causes for your faith. You could be on a mission to retrieve sacred relics lost in ancient ruins, holy objects from war-ravaged temples, or treasures to fill the
church's coffers. Your faith might drive you to hunt evil
monsters or stave off interplanar invasions, to protect
and defend the powerless from oppression and exploitation, or to spread the teachings of your religion in a land
that's hostile to it. 

The patronage of a religious order isn't simply a
matter of each member of your group belonging to the
same faith. An actual organization—with its own resources, goals, and leaders—sponsors and directs your adventures.
<<<

!!! Unity Dinners

[[Cadoc Belmin]] takes Arien to unity dinners and introduces her to the [[Khoravar|half-elf]] community in Starilaskur. [[Lorsanna]] joins too as well as others from the Martial Temple. Some other attendees include Sovelom, Fellise, and Paela.

!!! Other Organizations 

* the [[Swords of Liberty]]
* the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]]. Canon Emerald Claw members include:
** Krael Kavarat, a human [[vampire]]. Tall and muscular, wears plate armor, clean shaven with long blonde hair
** [[Demise]]
** [[Garrow]]
** Mallora, a necromancer
** Keltis Doran, a cleric
* the [[Black Highway]] and whoever manages it locally
* [[Daask]]. No canon information on the Starilaskur cell exists. [[Wroat]] cell is led by a medusa named Askhora, [[Passage]] cell is led by a werewolf named Fell, [[Sharn]] cell is led by an [[oni]] named [[Cavallah]]. Maybe this one is run by a [[fomorian]]? Or a [[gauth]]? Could be tension between local Black Highway smugglers and Daask.
* [[Mourning Dawn]]?


!!! Third Semester?

Could have an additional round of classes that don't need full scenes. Ideas:

* Domains of Faith (taught by Master Vasiraghi (human))
** [[Light Domain]]
** [[War Domain]]
** [[Peace Domain]]
** [[Life Domain]]
** [[Order Domain]]
** [[Knowledge Domain]]
** [[Forge Domain]]
* Battlefield tactics?

!!! Quests

Main services Arien will do:

# Smite evil in your order's name.
# Protect the downtrodden from the forces of oppression.
# Seek out and retrieve sacred relics and holy artifacts on behalf of your church.

Give Alita some options for what directions she can go, some choices for which quest to go on next.

[[Thelanis]]/[[Assembly]]/[[fey]] quests, maybe with the help of [[Dowin Lin Adredar]]:

* Dyn Singh Night Market
* [[Old Man Cord]]
* [[Skabatha Nightshade]]
* Invisible [[boggle]]s are leading victims (children?) to an [[annis hag]]. 
* Look up fairy/folk tales (specifically about artisans/makers) and make them Eberrony. 
** [[The Wonderful Toymaker|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Toymaker]]
** [[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30400/30400-h/30400-h.htm#chap05]]
** [[The Elves and the Shoemaker|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elves_and_the_Shoemaker]]. This is about little folks ([[sprite]]s? [[pixie]]s?) helping out a craftsman and his family. This could be a chance for Arien to shrink down to mouse size like Alita very much wants her to do
** [[The Smith and the Devil|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smith_and_the_Devil]]
** [[The Stone Flower|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stone_Flower]]
* A note on the [[Assembly]]: "An [[artificer]] could have been blessed by the [[Forge Maiden]]; their artifice isn't arcane science, they simply create impossible, whimsical things."

[[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]] quests:

* Early quests might just be helping out the town. There's going to be a harvest of "runnelberries" soon, in the freshwater marshes that lead to [[Lake Brey]], but some hostile creature is preventing that; go investigate. Twist: An agent of [[Balinor's Blessed]] (House [[Vadalis]]) wants to capture the creature and bring it to a Vadalis [[enclave]]. Could be exported to the [[Hearth]], or just sent to a local enclave: call it "Freybeck Ranch". He uses [[darts of tracking]].
** creature is jungle [[ankheg]], creature tier 3. 
** When Arien goes out into the Runnels to investigate, describe the [[storm spire]]s which [[Lyrandar]] uses to control the weather
* Martial Temple provides aid to the [[Heavenly Fleet]]. Could be something there, but that's way out in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. Maybe loop back around to this later.
* Gathering relics of some kind. This might lead to clashes with the [[Emerald Claw]], or cultists of [[Katashka]].
** If we're involving the Emerald Claw and maybe seeking out leaders of the organization in [[Starilaskur]], this could be a good dovetail into introducing [[Haldon d'Cannith]], if folks think he's a [[vampire]].
* Another series of quests might send Arien to [[Vathirond]], or even into the [[Mournland]]. This might lead to clashes with agents of the [[Lord of Blades]]. It also might cause Prince [[Oargev ir'Wynarn]] of [[New Cyre]] to take notice of Arien.
** From [[Mournland]] page: "A young Cyran paladin is morose because she was away from Cyre on a mission when the Day of Mourning occurred and never got to say goodbye to her family. She longs to retrieve her father's sword."
** "A wealthy eccentric asks the party to go into the Mournland and retrieve his most prized possession (a letter from a lover, a mechanical caterpillar, or anything else you devise) from his mansion."
** The Lord of Blades maintains a detention center where experiments are performed on adventurers and scavengers that his forces capture in the Mournland.

<<<
Prince Oargev is obsessed with the Mourning. He is desperate to discover the truth behind the destruction of his country. He regularly seeks information from those who venture into the [[Mournland]], and he funds expeditions into the remains of his once-proud nation, hoping to discover some clue as to the cause of Cyre's demise.
<<<

As Arien's powers grow, the mentor/teachers at the Martial Temple are confused at the way her powers manifest, and come to believe that her power comes primarily from the [[Silver Flame]], not from [[Dol Arrah]]. There are some Silver Flame experts in Breland, so her superiors recommend she travel to [[Sharn]] and get trained there at the [[Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame]]. (this is [[Sejra Whitebinder]]'s suggestion, at the objection of [[Cadoc Belmin]].)

!! Mistmarsh

Arien hasn’t gotten a letter from her parents or anyone from [[Mistmarsh]] in a while. She sends a letter telling her parents that she swore a paladin oath and graduated from novicehood, but still doesn’t get a response. She completes the [[Runnelberry Dale|A Menace in Runnelberry Dale]] quest, and still no response. So she decides to go back to Mistmarsh. [[Roak]] says he needs to stay in [[Starilaskur]] because the [[Brightblade]] festival is coming up and he needs to compete!

Take inspiration from Reavers of Harkenwold 4e adventure. 

Alben has left for Wroat, visiting his father Ruken and leaving his steward in charge, but the marauders have taken over [[Harkenton]]. They also have made a deal with the bullywugs, who had previously been kept in check by militias.

Other named folks from Mistmarsh are described here: [[First adventure: Scouting for Gatherhunt]]

Thoughts on adapting Reavers for this region:

* "Woodsinger" elves: replace these with "Cliffwalker" [[shifter]]s in the [[Howling Peaks]].
* Keep the [[bullywug]]s at Toadwallow Caverns, that's perfect for a marshy area
* Keep "Harkenwold" as the name of the county; "wold" means hilly uncultivated land, and can even mean "moor."
* Harken Village = [[Harkenton]], Albridge = [[Mistmarsh]].
* Iron Circle is a band of mercenaries that served in the [[Last War]] but are now just a band of marauders; In Albus's absence, they've taken over Harkenton and are spreading their influence across the county. They've also made a deal with the [[bullywug]]s to the north, which were previously kept in check.

Lots of steadings and hamlets around, like every 1-2 miles.

!! On the Way to Sharn

[[Lightning rail|lightning rail]] heist!!

Arien could end up in the [[King's Forest]]. There's a large [[manifest zone]] to [[Fernia]] there, could have a fun adventure there. This could be an opportunity to give her the "living blade" weapon from WotBS; perhaps it's the embodiment of a fiery [[dryad]].

In fact, maybe the [[Jungle Boys]] are behind the attack on the lightning rail, but the [[Swords of Liberty]] are ultimately responsible. They targeted the train because perhaps Aejar ir'Wynarn is on board; he got on at [[Wroat]], and the heist took place between Wroat and [[Sharn]]. They stole something of vital importance to him / the royal family, which leads Arien into the King's Forest with Aejar and his retinue. Or perhaps they kidnap Aejar himself! Gives Arien a chance to use her survival and tracking skills. She leads Aejar's remaining escort of [[King's Shields]]. Include a [[warforged]].

Before the heist, Aejar gets on the train at [[Wroat]]. If Arien meets him, they talk about the King's Forest, then about the King; Aejar might complain about his father, and how [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] hasn't picked an heir yet.

The Jungle Boys were told this was just to get ransom money from the crown, but a representative of the Swords of Liberty tell them (after the kidnapping) that their demands also include having [[Boranel ir'Wynarn]] sign a bill that would force him to step down and abolish Breland's monarchy. The Jungle Boys are furious at this and are just after the cash. This could be an exploitable point of contention between the two organizations.

Note: Aejar was attacked by a [[ghost tiger]] when he was young (a "tamed" one in the royal palace in [[Wroat]], after he repeatedly prodded it with a wooden sword), and he still has scars from that attack (and two prosthetic fingers). Ghost tigers are native to the [[King's Forest]], and Aejar tries to hide his sheer terror of the prospect of encountering them.

!!! Living Blade

From ChatGPT: "As the party ventures through the King's Forest, they encounter an area that feels unnaturally warm, with the flora and fauna displaying an unusual vibrancy. This is a manifest zone to the plane of Fernia, the Sea of Fire. Amidst the fiery hues of this area, they stumble upon a majestic, ancient tree with bright crimson leaves and a faintly glowing aura. This tree is the home of a fiery dryad named Embera."

The Jungle Boys have been coming to the manifest zone to Fernia lately and exploiting its resources. They came to Embera's tree and hacked pieces of it off, in order to carve into fiery darts and arrow shafts. They also cut down many rare [[firepine]]s for their very valuable wood, but in the process, destabilized the manifest zone. Now Embera's tree is weakened and dying, and the planar connection to Fernia is threatening to throw off the delicate ecological balance that maintains this part of the forest. Embera worries that the Sea of Fire will swell up and overtake this region in wildfires, wiping out habitats. The dryad names a family of endangered "liegferrets" and birds unique to this area that she loves, and wants to see thrive. Embera reaches out to Arien because she can detect the Fernian essence in her.

After dealing with saving Aejar, Arien comes back and follows Embera's instructions to perform a ritual to make this part of the forest more resilient to the elemental influences and save it from destruction. In the ritual, she might have to strengthen the bond between the remaining firepines to absorb the Fernian energies maybe? Perhaps through a magical chant. Maybe she needs strands of heartwood from the downed firepine trees; the dense core of the oldest firepines will help with the ritual. She might also need to contend with [[fire elemental]]s, or [[mephit]]s of smoke and magma.

In the end, Embera passes her spirit into a branch of her tree, the rest of which withers away. The branch becomes the Living Blade.

!! Sharn

Arien goes to [[Sharn]]. She is to check in with Archierophant [[Ythana Morr]] at the [[Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame]]. Could be the start to some cool adventures. But when she's there, she needs a way to make money; joins [[Clifftop Adventurers' Guild]]. Do the "Sharn chicken" scene from Fired and Forgotten. 

At some point, [[Roak]] visits. He's become a member of the [[Broken Blade]] in the interim, and he is learning smithing techniques; he hopes to become a swordmaster someday. He wants to visit the [[Pool of Onatar's Tears]].

Do the Delirium Stone adventure at some point, presumably as [[Aehion Hanius Hayttear]] has hired the Clifftop guild to recover the stone. When Arien goes back in time, she's in the "Burn" character's body, but she's not named "Burn" because that's dumb. Instead, her past character is name is "Gudhrin". (Means "burning hot" in old tolkien "Gnomish".)

It becomes clear that Arien's training and understanding of her true power is stifled by the quality of the [[Silver Flame]] experts in [[Breland]]. So her superiors at the Martial Temple recommend she travel to [[Thrane]] for training. However... as she is a citizen of [[Breland]], and she has sworn fealty to her local duke and her king, she is reminded of her duty to her nation. The nature of her powers is something of a state secret. Her superiors recommend extreme caution, try to convince her to stay under the radar about what she can do, try to avoid tipping off the Thrane government, which would probably happen via the [[Argentum]].

Perhaps also the Martial Temple wants her to reclaim some lost relic of the Sovereign Host while she's there.

!! Thrane

The [[Gilded Labyrinth]] studies the fusion of elemental fire with the [[Silver Flame]].

The [[Argentum]] will be very interested in Arien's powers.

Eventually, she realizes her power comes from a [[celestial]] of [[Fernia]], whose physical form was destroyed 20 years ago, and a sliver of that angel's power landed in Arien's soul. This leads her to seek out other planetouched folks, which leads her to the town of [[Rellekor]]. Here she meets with learned [[tiefling]]s who can reveal more of what's going on. Maybe here she meets a tiefling named Zaben who was touched by a fragment of a Fernian fiend in the same way Arien was.

!! Eventually

* Another shrink-down adventure involving [[brigganock]]s.
** Brigganock names: Trig, Zarli, Oyla, Golmo, Obud (lives in a hut on a pony named Keg, lowers a rope ladder to get down from the saddle straps), Pim, Zwee
* [[Krezent]]

!! Long-Term Plans

I think we can maybe think about a campaign focused in part around [[Katashka]] straining against its bonds. Its prison is shattered into little fragments, some of which could be used as phylacteries by [[lich]]es. Its speaker in the [[Lords of Dust]] is [[Mazyralyx]] the [[dracolich]]. His champions include the ancient wizard [[Kyuss]].

"The [[ghoul]]s of Katashka feast on flesh beneath cities across [[Khorvaire]]"

Discussion of the destruction of overlords from KB's twitter (https://www.sageadvice.eu/what-would-happen-if-overlord-were-thrown-into-a-well-of-annihilation/)

<<<
It might work, but the next question is what the consequences of doing that would be. Part of the reason the Overlords can't be destroyed is because they are part of the spiritual architecture of the world; in doing this you'd be tearing a hole in the soul of the world.

Rak Tulkhesh is the manifestation of aggression and war. Either it can't be destroyed, because ongoing aggression will cause it to reform... or you completely destroy the concept of aggression in mortals, which could have vast unforeseen consequences.
<<<

So the actual destruction of, say, [[Katashka]] might cause mortals to lose their fear of death entirely. Not great. 

So perhaps Arien's journey will be a way to form a "better" cage for these fiends, or some kind of system that restores the world to what it could have been had Siberys not been destroyed. Removing the overlords is a blunt instrument; Arien should find a way to bring about a new age where no matter what happens, the overlords can't break free and cause a new Age of Demons, without outright destroying them.

Another overlord we could use: [[Eldrantulku]] the Oathbreaker. Good reasons to suspect it is bound somewhere beneath Breland. In fact, his prakhutu [[Kashtarhak]], the Voice of Chaos, is a perfect villain for spreading discord in [[Breland]] and abroad, and probably is working with speakers of other overlords (e.g. [[Mazyralyx]], [[Mordakhesh]]) to make this come about. [[Emerald Claw]], cults of the [[Grim King|Katashka]], the [[Swords of Liberty]], etc. Other servants include [[Thelestes]].

The [[barghest]] curse originated as the betrayal of seventeen oaths, according to legend.

Also consider oathbound ([[mummies|mummy]]) and how their oaths might play into an Oathbreaker campaign.
