This is for sketching out adventures many sessions away. See [[Adventures of Arien]] for more imminent session prep.

[[Old Session Prep]]

!! Starilaskur

[[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]]. Liturgical council: "Vassal Assembly". 

[[Sejra Whitebinder]]

"Religious Order" from E:RftLW, adopted a bit

<<<
You act in the service of [[Starilaskur]]'s prestigious [[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]], pursuing causes for your faith. You could be on a mission to retrieve sacred relics lost in ancient ruins, holy
objects from war-ravaged temples, or treasures to fill the
church's coffers. Your faith might drive you to hunt evil
monsters or stave off interplanar invasions, to protect
and defend the powerless from oppression and exploitation, or to spread the teachings of your religion in a land
that's hostile to it. 

The patronage of a religious order isn't simply a
matter of each member of your group belonging to the
same faith. An actual organization—with its own resources, goals, and leaders—sponsors and directs your adventures.

!!! Quests

Main services Arien will do:

# Smite evil in your order's name.
# Protect the downtrodden from the forces of oppression.
# Seek out and retrieve sacred relics and holy artifacts on behalf of your church.

Give Alita some options for what directions she can go, some choices for which quest to go on next.

[[Thelanis]]/[[Assembly]] quests, maybe with the help of [[Dowin Lin Adredar]]:

* Invisible [[boggle]]s are leading victims (children?) to an [[annis hag]]. 
* Look up fairy tales and make them Eberrony. 
** [[The Wonderful Toymaker|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Toymaker]]
** [[The Elves and the Shoemaker|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elves_and_the_Shoemaker]]. This is about little folks ([[sprite]]s? [[pixie]]s?) helping out a craftsman and his family. This could be a chance for Arien to shrink down to mouse size like Alita very much wants her to do
* A note on the [[Assembly]]: "An [[artificer]] could have been blessed by the [[Forge Maiden]]; their artifice isn't arcane science, they simply create impossible, whimsical things."

[[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]] quests:

* Martial Temple provides aid to the [[Heavenly Fleet]]. Could be something there, but that's way out in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. Maybe loop back around to this later.
* Gathering relics of some kind. This might lead to clashes with the [[Emerald Claw]].
* Another series of quests might send Arien to [[Vathirond]], or even into the [[Mournland]]. This might lead to clashes with agents of the [[Lord of Blades]]. It also might cause Prince [[Oargev ir'Wynarn]] of [[New Cyre]] to take notice of Arien.
** From [[Mournland]] page: "A young Cyran paladin is morose because she was away from Cyre on a mission when the Day of Mourning occurred and never got to say goodbye to her family. She longs to retrieve her father's sword."
** "A wealthy eccentric asks the party to go into the Mournland and retrieve his most prized possession (a letter from a lover, a mechanical caterpillar, or anything else you devise) from his mansion."
** The Lord of Blades maintains a detention center where experiments are performed on adventurers and scavengers that his forces capture in the Mournland.

<<<
Prince Oargev is obsessed with the Mourning. He is desperate to discover the truth behind the destruction of his country. He regularly seeks information from those who venture into the [[Mournland]], and he funds expedi­tions into the remains of his once-proud nation, hoping to discover some clue as to the cause of Cyre's demise.

As Arien's powers grow, the mentor/teachers at the Martial Temple are confused at the way her powers manifest, and come to believe that her power comes primarily from the [[Silver Flame]], not from [[Dol Arrah]]. So they recommend she travel to [[Thrane]] for training.

!! Thrane

Eventually, she realizes her power comes from a [[celestial]] of [[Fernia]], whose physical form was destroyed 20 years ago, and a sliver of that angel's power landed in Arien's soul. This leads her to seek out other planetouched folks, which leads her to the town of [[Rellekor]]. Here she meets with learned [[tiefling]]s who can reveal more of what's going on. Maybe here she meets a tiefling named Zaben who was touched by a fragment of a Fernian fiend in the same way Arien was.

!! Sharn

Eventually Arien goes to [[Sharn]] because of course. Maybe she is sent there to check in with Archierophant [[Ythana Morr]] at the [[Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame]]. Could be the start to some cool adventures. But when she's there, she needs a way to make money; joins [[Clifftop Adventurers' Guild]]. Do the "Sharn chicken" scene from Fired and Forgotten. 

Do the Delirium Stone adventure at some point, presumably as [[Aehion Hanius Hayttear]] has hired the Clifftop guild to recover the stone. When Arien goes back in time, she's in the "Burn" character's body, but she's not named "Burn" because that's dumb. Instead, her past character is name is "Gudhrin". (Means "burning hot" in old tolkien "Gnomish".)
