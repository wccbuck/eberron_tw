!! General Adventure Ideas Alita Wants

* Dragon on a mountain
* "hidden truth revealed"
* Save a handsome prince on the road (could be [[Aejar ir'Wynarn|Sharn Inquisitive for Zarantyr 15th, 998]])
* Get treasure!
* Meet [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]]
* Save orphans (there's an orphanage in [[Gate of Gold]], where [[Viktor Saint-Demain]] was raised. Or maybe Arien has to deal with a haunted orphanage) 
* Underwater adventure ([[Thunder Sea]])
* Homestead, build home base

!! Miscellaneous Brainstorming

!!! CotSF Thoughts

Religious practices:

* No need for offerings at services; services focus on the parishioners, encouraging virtuous behavior. Donations are welcome but not directly asked for.
* Every Sul is the Day of Cleansing Fire, a day to recommit oneself to a life of purity.
** Fast for one meal, spending the mealtime in prayers of devotion and repentance, and perhaps donate the money you would have paid for the meal on alms for the needy or donations to the church.
** Many also attend Flamesong services in the evening. (non-canon) Perhaps the parishioners pass a tiny flame from person to person, symbolizing the shared responsibility to protect the innocent; each person holds the candle/torch for a few moments, reflecting on their duty, before passing it on.
* The substance known as [[silverburn]] is used during many ceremonies of the church to make ordinary candles or torches resemble the radiant energy of the [[Silver Flame]]. However, some within the church believe that this is unseemly and even profane.
* Archery is a devotional practice, used both as a means of meditation and a martial art.

Some other, non-canon ideas:

* Ritual baths infused with sanctified herbs to cleanse oneself of impurities, symbolic and real. These baths are taken at significant life milestones or after facing particularly trying spiritual challenges.

''Titles:'' in addition to Bishop, Archbishop, Cardinal, High Cardinal, Flamebearer, and Archierophant, here are some other possible titles for church ministers and leaders:

* Luminary. Senior leaders who are sources of wisdom and guidance
* Liegmund: means "protector/guardian of flame" in old english. Lieg = flame. Something to think about

''How is the Church in Breland different than elsewhere?''

* Practices might reflect Breland's more cosmopolitan nature. Teachings might highlight stories where the Flame acted though non-human agents, or where evils have been averted through understanding and diplomacy.
* Perhaps there's a practice where members invite beings from "category 3" (medusas, trolls, gnolls, ogres, etc) for a shared meal, symbolizing acceptance and shared commitment to peace. Call it "Allkind Supper."
** Could be held in temple halls or even in residential areas, members of CotSF and folk of the Barrens (perhaps called "mosaic folk") bring their own home-cooked dishes, and are encouraged to tell the story behind their dish. 
** Some mosaic folk appreciate this gesture, but others question its intentions, and even feel tokenized in a way that underscores their "otherness."

''Templars in Breland''

* I think it is popular to refer to a templar as "Ser [first name]," and it's unusual to use the templar's last name in e.g. newspaper articles; only when using their full name for clarification.
* Headquarters: "Bastion of Eternal Vigilance?" iunno. I like the idea of it being located in [[Black Arch]]. Could officially just be called the "Bastion of the Templar Commandery of Breland" (BTCB)
* Commander of Breland: "Silloene d'Medani". A [[dragonmark]]ed member of House [[Medani]]. Tall and graceful, with dark, wavy hair streaked with silver, and sharp light-brown eyes that miss nothing.
** Emphasizes integration and understanding, making her popular in Breland but perhaps more controversial among more orthodox members of the church. She respects tradition, but is known to adapt teachings to the ever-changing landscape of Sharn. She walks a fine line, ensuring that her more inclusive practices don't offer openings for Pure-Flame-types to accuse her of deviating too far from the church's teachings
** Maintains her connection to her House, and thus maintains a network of informants, ensuring the templars are one step ahead of any potential threat.
** KB says: "The [[Korth Edicts]] prevent Dragonmarked heirs from owning land or wielding political power. But they don’t cover every possible position of authority, and notably can become priests without having to cut ties with their houses. Dragonmarked heirs have just as much right to practice their chosen religion as anyone else; many of the houses assert that their gifts show that they are favored by the Sovereigns. In the case of the Silver Flame, yes, a Medani Heir could become a templar commander. But keep in mind that those commanders are chosen by the cardinals and certified by the Keeper; any candidate will have to have shown unshakable faith and commitment to the Church, as well as tactical brilliance and a long record of service. So they wouldn’t have to legally break ties to their house, but there could be no question of their commitment to the Church."
** Ser Silloene recently rose to this role. Her predecessor, Ser Graym Lannerik, retired to a remote monastery as a Luminary. But for many years, he served as Silloene's mentor and helped her navigate church politics.
* Marshals: 
** Elrik Sensworth, believes in results over ritual. Often clashes with more orthodox templars
** Hilia Graddan, a former member of the [[Sharn Watch]] (specifically [[Guardians of the Gate]]). Has an extensive knowledge of the city's layout.
* See [[Coldflame Keep]]; there used to be a much larger templar presence in Sharn. From [[Mazin Tana]]: "The garrison [at Coldflame Keep] was built to house a hundred soldiers, but currently there are only eight templars in residence. While these soldiers are supposed to protect the district from supernatural threats, Mazin believes that they have been chosen by the Archierophant to keep an eye on the aging priest—to make certain that Mazin does not try to interfere with the powers that control the Church in Sharn. While he is disillusioned with his superiors, Mazin still believes in the ideals of the Church and does his best to help those in need." Wow, so maybe there's a contingent of templars who are loyal to [[Ythana Morr]], and Ser Silloene is somehow unaware of this. Or she is, but she's not sure to what degree. There could be a series of quests where Silloene asks Arien to investigate Ythana, as an outsider. Eventually, Arien could help overthrow Ythana and Mazin Tana could be appointed the new Archierophant.

!!! Liturgical Councils

Names for [[liturgical council]]s, thanks to ChatGPT:

* Council of the Sacred Nine
* The Cerulean Synod
* Synod of Dawn's Promise
* Liturgical Council of [region or city name]
* Liturgical Assembly of [region or city name]
* Sovereign Summit of [region or city name]
* Hieratic Council of [region or city name]
* [region or city name] Committee of Vassal Priests

!!! Knightly Orders in Breland

* Order of the Stalwart Heart: members swear oaths to defend the weak, including/especially Cyran refugees. No religious affiliation, no reference to Sovereigns in the oaths. Democratic/egalitarian leadership system; knights are chosen for leadership roles based on merit, experience, and the votes of their peers.
** Set up fortified camps as safe havens for refugees during and after the war
** Programs for veteran support
** Programs for rebuilding destroyed towns and villages
* Order of the Dawn Chorus: based in Starilaskur, many former Martial Temple members. They sometimes try to locate Brelish paladins who have defected to another country or broken their oaths, even working with the Sentinel Marshals at times.
* Order of the Woven Boughs: members are adept at woodland combat and survival. They swear oaths of mutual assistance, ensuring that if one member faces hardship, the others will come to their aid. They offer something like health insurance to members; everyone pays in, then leadership pays out when someone gets sick or injured.
** During the Last War, this order protected and maintained supply chains through wooded regions.
* Knighthood of the Fifelic Rune: perhaps a [[rune knight]] order with a secret-society feel. Focus on mysticism. Got their secrets of rune magic from a [[schema]] from ancient [[Xen'drik]]. The most elite members can [[enlarge|enlarge/reduce]] to giant's stature in combat. They protect their secrets at all costs. Today, they act as guardians of some of Breland's arcane vaults. But their secretive nature has made them a focus of suspicion and intrigue. It's possible some within the leadership are also members of the [[Court of Shadows]].


!! Mistmarsh

[[The Reavers of Harkenwold]]

After this mission, Arien returns to Starilaskur, and talks with Sejra. Sejra wants Arien to travel to Sharn, to the [[templar]] Commandery there, to explore and develop her connection to the Silver Flame. The [[Preceptor|Cadoc Belmin]] expresses resistance to this idea, saying that [[Ythana Morr]] is notoriously corrupt. Sejra replies that Arien wouldn't be reporting to the Archierophant anyway, she could report to Ser Silloene, the Commander of Breland. And there are other great Flamist spiritual guides in Sharn, like Flamebearer [[Mazin Tana]], a personal friend of Sejra's.

In the end, the Preceptor doesn't have a good argument for preventing Arien from going. But he does warn her that all Church of the Silver Flame leadership, even in Breland, and including the templar commander, are appointed by [[Thrane]]'s [[Council of Cardinals]]. He knows Arien has something special, but he's concerned that the Church will twist or corrupt her gift, or that the Thrane government will get involved. He wants to make sure she has a strong foundation in Sharn before she reaches out to the templars. The [[Devout of the Celestial Crown]] is the main [[liturgical council]] for [[Sharn]]. Belmin coordinates with them, and directs Arien to report to Aerela Tal (khoravar adept) at the [[Citadel of the Sun]] in [[Hope's Peak]], [[Upper Dura]]. (Conveniently, this district borders [[Clifftop]].)

!! On the Way to Sharn

A joke: 

An [[elf]] returns to his native [[Sharn]] after centuries of traveling. He arrives at [[Terminus Station]], goes outside, puts his suitcase on the ground, looks around and sighs. “Oh Sharn, I don’t recognize you at all!” He looks down, and his suitcase is gone. “Ah, it’s great to be home!”

[[Argonth]] moves across the country this year (from the [[Mournland]] border to the [[Droaam]] border). Arien sees it on the lightning rail ride to Sharn.

[[Lightning rail|lightning rail]] heist!!

Arien could end up in the [[King's Forest]]. There's a large [[manifest zone]] to [[Fernia]] there, could have a fun adventure there. This could be an opportunity to give her the "living blade" weapon from WotBS; perhaps it's the embodiment of a fiery [[dryad]].

In fact, maybe the [[Jungle Boys]] are behind the attack on the lightning rail, but the [[Swords of Liberty]] are ultimately responsible. They targeted the train because perhaps Aejar ir'Wynarn is on board; he got on at [[Wroat]], and the heist took place between Wroat and [[Sharn]]. They stole something of vital importance to him / the royal family, which leads Arien into the King's Forest with Aejar and his retinue. Or perhaps they kidnap Aejar himself! Gives Arien a chance to use her survival and tracking skills. She leads Aejar's remaining escort of [[King's Shields]]. Include a [[warforged]].

Before the heist, Aejar gets on the train at [[Wroat]]. If Arien meets him, they talk about the King's Forest, then about the King; Aejar might complain about his father, and how [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] hasn't picked an heir yet.

The Jungle Boys were told this was just to get ransom money from the crown, but a representative of the Swords of Liberty tell them (after the kidnapping) that their demands also include having [[Boranel ir'Wynarn]] sign a bill that would force him to step down and abolish Breland's monarchy. The Jungle Boys are furious at this and are just after the cash. This could be an exploitable point of contention between the two organizations.

Note: Aejar was attacked by a [[ghost tiger]] when he was young (a "tamed" one in the royal palace in [[Wroat]], after he repeatedly prodded it with a wooden sword), and he still has scars from that attack (and two prosthetic fingers). Ghost tigers are native to the [[King's Forest]], and Aejar tries to hide his sheer terror of the prospect of encountering them.

!!! Living Blade

From ChatGPT: "As the party ventures through the King's Forest, they encounter an area that feels unnaturally warm, with the flora and fauna displaying an unusual vibrancy. This is a manifest zone to the plane of Fernia, the Sea of Fire. Amidst the fiery hues of this area, they stumble upon a majestic, ancient tree with bright crimson leaves and a faintly glowing aura. This tree is the home of a fiery dryad named Embera."

The [[Swords of Liberty]] have been coming to this manifest zone to Fernia lately and exploiting its resources, to the chagrin of the [[Jungle Boys]] who live in the forest and try to keep a low profile. (This isn't THE big manifest zone of the King's Forest, just one small one.) They came to Embera's tree and hacked pieces of it off, in order to carve into fiery darts and arrow shafts. They also cut down many rare [[firepine]]s for their very valuable wood, but in the process, destabilized the manifest zone. Now Embera's tree is weakened and dying, and the planar connection to Fernia is threatening to throw off the delicate ecological balance that maintains this part of the forest. Embera worries that the Sea of Fire will swell up and overtake this region in wildfires, wiping out habitats. The dryad names a family of endangered "liegferrets" and birds unique to this area that she loves, and wants to see thrive. Embera reaches out to Arien because she can detect the Fernian essence in her.

After dealing with saving Aejar, Arien comes back and follows Embera's instructions to perform a ritual to make this part of the forest more resilient to the elemental influences and save it from destruction. In the ritual, she might have to strengthen the bond between the remaining firepines to absorb the Fernian energies maybe? Perhaps through a magical chant. Maybe she needs strands of heartwood from the downed firepine trees; the dense core of the oldest firepines will help with the ritual. She might also need to contend with [[fire elemental]]s, or [[mephit]]s of smoke and magma.

In the end, Embera passes her spirit into a branch of her tree, the rest of which withers away. The branch becomes the Living Blade.

!!! Conclusion

Aejar, as a prince, has the authority to appoint knights. (Knighthood is an honor, not a title of nobility.) The title carries status, as it reflects service to the nation, but it isn't tied to inheritance or land. Perhaps he offers to knight Arien once they get back to [[Sharn]]. She might also meet King [[Boranel ir'Wynarn]]; he's at [[Castle Arakhain]] for the first half of [[Barrakas]], but perhaps the King himself knights Arien after some time passes. But if she gets knighted, I'll need some options for chivalric orders of Breland

!! Sharn

Arien goes to [[Sharn]]. She is to check in with Aerela Tal at the [[Citadel of the Sun]], eventually go talk to [[Mazin Tana]] at [[Coldflame Keep]]. I also might need to make a [[templar]] Commander of Breland who has a headquarters in [[Sharn]] (could be that's where it historically is located because of the [[Malleon the Reaver]] wight thing). This Commander would have jurisdiction over [[Droaam]] too, technically, though in practice that means little. The Commander's assistants carry the title of marshal, and then beneath them everybody is just a "knight templar."

[[Silver Flame]] church stuff could be the start to some cool adventures. But when she's in Sharn, she needs a way to make money; joins [[Clifftop Adventurers' Guild]]. Do the "Sharn chicken" scene from Fired and Forgotten. 

Might need to push back the [[Race of Eight Winds]] since Arien might arrive right after it canonically happens.

!!! Sharn Adventures Worth Considering

* ''Delirium Stone'' (see below)
* ''Fallen Angel'' (Dungeon 117)
* ''Fired and Forgotten'' (Convergence Manifesto): [[Clifftop Adventurers' Guild]], retrieve an artifact from the Cogs, but have to deal with a warforged labor strike first
* ''Curtain Call'' (DMs Guild)
* ''Steel Shadows'' (Dungeon 115)
* ''Murder in Oakbridge'' (Dungeon 129)
* Viktor Saint-Demain
** ''Chimes at Midnight'': Should happen close to [[Wildnight]] in [[Sypheros]] since that's when the climax of the story happens
** ''Quoth the Raven'': Happens during winter. Before this, a mysterious explosion in the Cogs caused a huge ongoing fire that has blanketed the city in smoke (moody backdrop)
** ''Hell's Heart'':
* ''Forgotten Relics'' (RftLW page 260)
* "First Campaign" adventures (require editing):
** ''The Forgotten Forge'' (ECS): Find the body of [[Bonal Geldem]], who was researching a [[schema]] which both agents of the [[Lord of Blades]] and [[Merrix d'Cannith]] want. Need to go into the sewers, encounter [[Skakan]], go into [[Old Sharn]], find an old [[Cannith]] foundry, face [[Saber]] and [[Cutter]]
** ''Shadows of the Last War'': Look for another part of the schema, this time contending with agents of the [[Emerald Claw]]. But we don't stay in [[Sharn]], we travel to [[Darguun]] to find the location of [[Whitehearth]] in the [[Mournland]]
** ''Whispers of the Vampire's Blade'': Back to Sharn, need to find an agent of the Dark Lanterns who's gone rogue (Lucan Stellos), and stolen some ancient magic longsword. Turns out some "psionic vampire" compelled him to do it. Adventure goes to Trolanport, an airship, Thrane
** ''Grasp of the Emerald Claw'': Go to Stormreach, then into Xen'drik

!!! Areas Around the Citadel of the Sun

The [[Citadel of the Sun]] is in [[Hope's Peak]]. There is also a temple of the [[Silver Flame]] here, no details for it though. "While most of the priests of the region are devout enough, this is Dura, and pragmatism abounds. If a party of adventurers knows who to talk to and how to approach them, divine miracles can be bought outright."

[[High Hope]] and [[Coldflame Keep]] are over in [[Northedge]]; might consider swapping it out for the temple that's supposed to be here in Hope's Peak.

[[Clifftop]] to the north, lots to do there.

[[Highwater]] to the northwest, [[Pegasus Spire]]

[[Redstone]] to the southwest, just a residential area

[[Hareth's Folly]] below; [[Callestan]] not that far away

!!! Misc Sharn Thoughts

Could do something with [[Fathen's Fall]], Barrakas 25.

At some point, [[Roak]] visits. He's become a member of the [[Broken Blade]] in the interim, and he is learning smithing techniques; he hopes to become a swordmaster someday. He wants to visit the [[Pool of Onatar's Tears]].

Do the Delirium Stone adventure at some point, presumably as [[Aehion Hanius Hayttear]] has hired the Clifftop guild to recover the stone. When Arien goes back in time, she's in the "Burn" character's body, but she's not named "Burn" because that's dumb. Instead, her past character is name is "Gudhrin". (Means "burning hot" in old tolkien "Gnomish".)

It becomes clear that Arien's training and understanding of her true power is stifled by the quality of the [[Silver Flame]] experts in [[Breland]]. So her superiors at the Martial Temple recommend she travel to [[Thrane]] for training. However... as she is a citizen of [[Breland]], and she has sworn fealty to her local duke and her king, she is reminded of her duty to her nation. The nature of her powers is something of a state secret. Her superiors recommend extreme caution, try to convince her to stay under the radar about what she can do, try to avoid tipping off the Thrane government, which would probably happen via the [[Argentum]].

Perhaps also the Martial Temple wants her to reclaim some lost relic of the Sovereign Host while she's there.

!!! Leaving Sharn

If I want to start incorporating [[Eldrantulku]] and his straining against his bonds, perhaps an ally of Arien's in Sharn brutally betrays her, breaking an oath in the process. Also, Arien starts to get negative press, perhaps in the [[Voice of Breland|Five Voices]] (making her out to be a traitor to Thrane), or other newspapers.

!! Thrane

The [[Gilded Labyrinth]] studies the fusion of elemental fire with the [[Silver Flame]].

The [[Argentum]] will be very interested in Arien's powers.

Eventually, she realizes her power comes from a [[celestial]] of [[Fernia]], whose physical form was destroyed 20 years ago, and a sliver of that angel's power landed in Arien's soul. This leads her to seek out other planetouched folks, which leads her to the town of [[Rellekor]]. Here she meets with learned [[tiefling]]s who can reveal more of what's going on. Maybe here she meets a tiefling named Zaben who was touched by a fragment of a Fernian fiend in the same way Arien was.

!! Eventually

* Another shrink-down adventure involving [[brigganock]]s.
** Brigganock names: Trig, Zarli, Oyla, Golmo, Obud (lives in a hut on a pony named Keg, lowers a rope ladder to get down from the saddle straps), Pim, Zwee
* [[Krezent]]
* Consider [[Eyes Unclouded Anthology|https://www.dmsguild.com/product/322733/Eyes-Unclouded]]. Cinderlings are perfect for Arien.
* Consider stealing ideas from Oracle of War if Arien wants to salvage in the Mournland (don't forget I have some thoughts on Mournland stuff in [[Old Miscellaneous Planning Notes]]
* A journey to the [[Labyrinth]] to meet with the [[Ghaash'kala]]. Learn about the Binding Flame. Maybe she is sent here (or chooses to come here) to investigate what happened to a great paladin who never returned, and to recover his holy relics. 
** Travel through Aundair (encounter Pure Flame?)
** Travel through the Eldeen Reaches (encounter maybe a village that needs help, then enter the Towering Wood and maybe encounter shifters/lycanthropes) 
** Arrive in the Demon Wastes and fight fiends and barbarians with the Ghaash’kala orcs. 

!! Long-Term Plans

I think we can maybe think about a campaign focused in part around [[Katashka]] straining against its bonds. Its prison is shattered into little fragments, some of which could be used as phylacteries by [[lich]]es. Its speaker in the [[Lords of Dust]] is [[Mazyralyx]] the [[dracolich]]. His champions include the ancient wizard [[Kyuss]].

"The [[ghoul]]s of Katashka feast on flesh beneath cities across [[Khorvaire]]"

Discussion of the destruction of overlords from KB's twitter (https://www.sageadvice.eu/what-would-happen-if-overlord-were-thrown-into-a-well-of-annihilation/)

<<<
It might work, but the next question is what the consequences of doing that would be. Part of the reason the Overlords can't be destroyed is because they are part of the spiritual architecture of the world; in doing this you'd be tearing a hole in the soul of the world.

Rak Tulkhesh is the manifestation of aggression and war. Either it can't be destroyed, because ongoing aggression will cause it to reform... or you completely destroy the concept of aggression in mortals, which could have vast unforeseen consequences.
<<<

So the actual destruction of, say, [[Katashka]] might cause mortals to lose their fear of death entirely. Not great. 

So perhaps Arien's journey will be a way to form a "better" cage for these fiends, or some kind of system that restores the world to what it could have been had Siberys not been destroyed. Removing the overlords is a blunt instrument; Arien should find a way to bring about a new age where no matter what happens, the overlords can't break free and cause a new Age of Demons, without outright destroying them.

Another overlord we could use: [[Eldrantulku]] the Oathbreaker. Good reasons to suspect it is bound somewhere beneath Breland. In fact, his prakhutu [[Neabaz]], the Voice of Chaos, is a perfect villain for spreading discord in [[Breland]] and abroad, and probably is working with speakers of other overlords (e.g. [[Mazyralyx]], [[Mordakhesh]]) to make this come about. [[Emerald Claw]], cults of the [[Grim King|Katashka]], the [[Swords of Liberty]], etc. Other servants include [[Thelestes]], a "claw" of Neabaz.

* Another servant of Neabaz is "[[Bethageh]]" (beth-AH-geh), a slug-like fiend who commands [[tar devil]]s (look up pictures of Baalzebul). This is the entity worshiped by the [[Iron Circle]].

The [[barghest]] curse originated as the betrayal of seventeen oaths, according to legend.

Also consider oathbound ([[mummies|mummy]]) and how their oaths might play into an Oathbreaker campaign.
