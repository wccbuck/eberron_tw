        "text": "Traven ir'Thavar was a [[Cyran|Cyre]] nobleman who settled in [[Stormreach]] within the first few years of the [[Last War]], and was instrumental in the development of what would become the ward of [[Dannel's Pride]]. When [[Breland]] seized control of the [[Galifar]] [[consulate|Brelish Consulate (Stormreach)]] in Stormreach in 894 YK, Traven pressured Queen [[Mishann|Mishann ir'Wynarn]] to act quickly to maintain Cyre's ties to the gateway to [[Xen'drik]]. Mishann was preoccupied with the war and had little interest in the matter, but she permitted Traven to lead this effort.\n\nLord Traven, his immediate family, and a band of Cyran merchants formed the heart of this Cyran migration to [[Stormreach]], but they quickly established themselves in the community of [[Cross]]. Many decades later, following the [[Darguul|Ghaal'dar]] conquest of [[southern Cyre|Darguun]], a wave of refugees crossed the [[Thunder Sea]], seeking to escape the horror of war. Traven's son ''Taraval ir'Thavar'' devoted his family's fortune to buying up property and creating homes for the refugees, and [[Dannel's Pride]] was born.\n\n[[Jalaine ir'Thavar]], Taraval's daughter and Traven's granddaughter, is a notable personality in [[Cross]] district.",
