Cornerstone is the largest of the [[slaad]] cities, located on one of the [[Shifting Islands]] of [[Kythri]]. Its architectural style and precise layout are constantly changing, but it's always
a sprawling city that houses hundreds of thousands of slaadi.
If Cornerstone is held by the Concordance of Iron, it has
vast armies drilling (though their tactics and units constantly
shift). If it's under the influence of the Final Regency, there
are immense temples and countless shrines to the slaadi
interpretation of the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]]. 

The attitude of slaadi toward adventurers depends on the
active culture. The Final Regency may welcome adventurers who
profess devotion to the Sovereigns, provided they don't question
the Regency interpretation. The Confluence of Reality celebrates
extraplanar visitors, desiring their stories and performances.
Meanwhile, the Cornerstone of the Glorious Union of Flesh is
a very dangerous place to visit! Regardless, Cornerstone is the
best place to acquire Kythrian artifacts or magical services.
