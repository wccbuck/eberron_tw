Its seat is [[Port Verge]] on the island of [[Questor]]. The Diresharks have an intense rivalry with the [[Seadragons]], and Prince Kolberkon sees himself as next in line for the position of High Prince.\n\nThe Diresharks have struck deals with House [[Lyrandar]] for financing the development of [[Port Verge]], so that it might rival [[Regalport]]. In exchange, Lyrandar hopes to assert their influence over the [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] merchant fleets and compete with the [[Seadragons]] (and their House [[Orien]] [[couriers|Couriers Guild]]). Lyrandar also intends to put pressure on Prince [[Kolberkon]] to help apprehend the excoriate [[Koulton Brightwind]], Prince of the [[Wind Whisperers]].",
