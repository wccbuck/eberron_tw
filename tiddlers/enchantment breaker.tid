This ring's tiny chains rotate slowly around your finger while you wear it. While you wear this ring, you have [[advantage]] to resist [[enchantment]]s. In addition, when you are targeted by a [[spell]] that heals your wounds, such as [[cure wounds]] or [[healing word]], you may make a low-[[risk]] attempt with [[advantage]] to break free of any one [[enchantment]] spell currently affecting you.
