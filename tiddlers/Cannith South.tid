''Leader'': [[Merrix d'Cannith]]<br/>
''Headquarters:'' [[Cannith Tower|Cannith Enclave (Dragon Towers)]] ([[Sharn]], [[Breland]])

The [[Mourning]] destroyed the central leadership of House [[Cannith]]. Today, the [[dragonmarked house]] is split into three factions: Cannith South, [[Cannith West]], and [[Cannith East]]. [[Merrix|Merrix d'Cannith]], [[Jorlanna|Jorlanna d'Cannith]], and [[Zorlan|Zorlan d'Cannith]] are each determined to become the next leader of the house; between them, they have divided the lords seneschal so evenly that
a new baron will likely never be chosen. As it stands,
the divided leadership makes it increasingly likely that
only death or disaster will change the balance of power.

Under [[Merrix d'Cannith]], Cannith South is considered
by many to be the closest replacement for [[Whitehearth]]
the house will ever see. With his [[enclave]] concealing the
last Cannith [[creation forge]], Merrix rules his house’s
southern interests (including expeditions to [[Xen'drik]]
and the [[Mournland]]) with an iron fist.

Cannith South workshops and enclaves dot [[Breland]],
[[Zilargo]], and even [[Darguun]], making Merrix the most
expansion-minded leader House [[Cannith]] has seen in
an age. Some say he plans to open facilities in [[Xen'drik]]
to support his expeditions and interests there. Merrix has already secured
holdings to expand the enclave in [[Stormreach]]. Only
Merrix himself knows that he plans not just a workshop,
but a second Cannith [[creation forge]]—outside [[Khorvaire]],
where the [[Treaty of Thronehold]] has no sway.

The heirs of Cannith South are driven to achieve—advancement is dependent on how closely one’s ideals and ambitions match those of Merrix. Worship of the [[Traveler]]
in his [[artificer]] aspect has taken a slow hold among the members of Cannith South. This affiliation with one of the [[Dark Six]] troubles members of [[Cannith West]] in particular, but Merrix shows no sign of sharing their concern.
