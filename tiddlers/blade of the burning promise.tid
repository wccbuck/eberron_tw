The [[Sulatar]] [[drow]] of [[Xen'drik]] believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a wave of fire and blood. When this time comes, the greatest champion of the Sulatar will stand at the head of a [[Fernia]]n army, and they will bear the //blade of the burning promise//. 

The blade is one of the most sacred relics of the [[Sulatar]], and should it fall into the hands of adventurers, the drow will go to any lengths to retrieve it. This two-bladed [[orichalcum]] sword has been carried by the war leader of the Sulatar since before the fall of the [[giant]] nations, handed down from one generation to the next. Few have fully mastered the powers of the //blade of the burning promise//, but each has carried it faithfully, waiting for the time when the final fire sweeps the land.

The blade possesses two tiers of magical power. Anyone who carries it can cause it to burst into flames, as a [[flame tongue]], but granting the wielder power to control the flow of the fire. But its greater power of full command of fire [[elemental]]s is hidden within. To gain access to the full powers of the blade, a character must prove themself
worthy of the weapon. There is no single path to follow. They could use the //blade of the burning promise// to start some great conflagration, survive a journey to [[Fernia]], or
defeat an immensely powerful foe. If and when the character has performed an act worthy of the blade, the glyphs inscribed around the black leather grip glow with a terrible red light, and the wielder will instantly know the full extent of its powers and how
to use them.
