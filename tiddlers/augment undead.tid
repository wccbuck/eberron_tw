Choose up to three mindless [[undead]] creatures of your choice within 90 feet. For the next hour, whenever any of those undead makes an attempt using a specific [[action]] or [[attribute]] (your choice), they have [[advantage]]. In addition, for the duration of the spell, those undead are resistant to being [[turned|turn undead]].
