The aarakocra, also known as birdfolk, are avian [[humanoid]]s who live in high, mountainous regions. They are strong fliers and capable warriors. They may have originated on the [[plane]] of [[Lamannia]], in the [[layer]] known as the [[First Storm]]. Aarakocras can perform a group ritual involving an aerial dance to summon an [[air elemental]] (as the spell [[conjure elemental]]).
