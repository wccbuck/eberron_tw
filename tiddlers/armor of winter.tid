A protective magical force surrounds you, manifesting as a spectral frost that covers you and your gear. You gain an extra temporary [[harm]] box, which is prioritized whenever you suffer harm, that lasts for 1 hour. If a creature hits you at close range while you have this extra harm box, the creature suffers cold damage.
