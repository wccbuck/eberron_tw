title: color pool
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Gateways leading from the [[Astral Sea]] to other [[plane]]s appear as two-dimensional pools of rippling colors, <<dr 1d6>>Ã—10 feet in diameter. Traveling to another [[plane]] requires locating the appropriate color pool, which can be identified by color, as shown in the table below. These color pools appear as twinkling stars amid the silvery void of the Astral Sea, but their colors are difficult to differentiate from a great distance.
