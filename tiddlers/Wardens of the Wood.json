        "text": "//We, the Wardens of the Wood, protect all the children of Eberron, from the beasts of the wild to the people of the cities. We preserve the balance between nature and civilization and help each understand the other. //\n\nThe largest of the [[druid]]ic sects of the [[Eldeen Reaches]]\nis the Wardens of the Woods. With thousands\nof active members, the sect’s primary purpose\nis to protect the innocent, whether creatures of\ncivilization or of wood and wild. The Wardens\nensure that the dangers of the [[Towering Wood]]\ndon’t spill out into the farmlands of the Eldeen Reaches, while also dealing with brigands,\npoachers, and other interlopers from the\ncivilized world. \n\nAlthough most Wardens live on the fringes of\ncivilization within the communities of their sect,\nevery [[Eldeen|Eldeen Reaches]] village has a single Warden advisor\nwho seeks to peacefully resolve disputes within\ntheir village or with other communities. These\nadvisors travel the nearby farms to ensure the\nfarmers of the Reaches work peacefully with the\nland, nurturing it with each harvest, instead of\ndoing harm.\n\nUnder a different capacity, Wardens serve as\nthe militia of the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. While they\nare the largest sect, most of their members are\nhunters or advisors. ",
