This worn francesca-style axe has a rosewood handle wrapped in worn red leather. The wielder can summon this axe back to their hand at will, if it is anywhere within 300 feet. The axe will fly through the air, crashing through walls, furniture, or whatever unfortunate creatures that happen to stand in its way.
