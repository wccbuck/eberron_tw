This wooden cube is about an inch across. When it is placed into a body of water, it begins transforming. After one minute, it becomes a rowboat (10 ft by 5 ft, can hold 4 people). A day later, it transforms again into a keelboat (50 ft by 15 ft, can hold 25 people). Another day later, it transforms into a sailing ship (100 ft by 18 ft, can hold 75 people). Another day later, it transforms into a galley (130 ft by 20 ft, can hold 100 people). After one day as a galley, the ship dissolves into wet sawdust.
