While on a [[plane]] with this property, [[beast]]s and [[elemental]]s are filled with vigor and fortitude. Upon its arrival in this plane, any elemental or beast that's charmed or bound in any way is immediately freed from that effect; this can be disastrous for an elemental [[airship]] that's thrown into the plane.
