title: scroll of crossing
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This heavy scroll is fastened with thick hemp twine. When the scroll is thrown on the ground and the incantation is uttered, a 20-foot-long bridge slowly sprouts from the ground, spanning whatever gap the user indicates. The bridge is permanent and this scroll can only be used once.
