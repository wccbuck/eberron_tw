Shava House, a small academic
community on the campus of [[Morgrave University]],
was originally a housing unit for professors with no
families. It has developed into more of an intentional community: the residents share meals heavily laden with academic discourse, and generally share
an interest in the history of [[Xen'drik]]. An unassuming member of this commune is [[Dala Arand]]â€”a friendly scholar active in planning expeditions
to Xen'drik, while also secretly serving as a spy for
the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]].
