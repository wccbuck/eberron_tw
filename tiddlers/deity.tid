type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The gods of [[Eberron]] don't manifest physically, but people of faith believe that divine forces shape everyday life. Shared beliefs unite communities and can provide hope in difficult times. 

Those who channel [[divine magic]] might ascribe that power to a specific deity, which may be true. But it is equally possible that the spellcaster draws on a well of power formed from the collective faith of many thousands of believers. In this sense, it is impossible to prove the existence of a deity in Eberronâ€”but regardless of its nature and source, none can deny the power of faith.
