The blade of this dagger is etched with spiraling runic patterns. When you [[attune|attunement]] to the blade, its surface becomes blank as it sinks into your forearm, leaving behind its runes as a tattoo on your skin. You may speak the bladeâ€™s command word to call it to your hand or return it to your forearm.
