While wearing this diamond-studded belt, you can choose to alter the appearance of the night sky within 100 feet of you. You can make stars shift position, create new constellations, or conjure planets or comets. A discerning creature carefully examining the [[illusion]] may be able to see through it. The illusion lasts until the next dawn. The belt can only be used in this way once per night.
