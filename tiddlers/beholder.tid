One glance at a beholder is enough to assess its foul and otherworldly nature. Aggressive, hateful, and greedy, these [[aberration]]s dismiss all other creatures as lesser beings, toying with them or destroying them as they choose.

A beholder's spheroid body levitates at all times, and its great bulging eye sits above a wide, toothy maw, while the smaller eyestalks that crown its body twist and turn to keep its foes in sight. When a beholder sleeps, it closes its central eye but leaves its smaller eyes open and alert. Each of these smaller eyes are capable of emitting a different ray of magical energy; the gaze from one eyestalk might result in petrification, while a different eye ray might disintegrate its target, and another might charm a [[humanoid]].

Beholders and their kin ([[gazer]]s, [[gauth]]s, [[spectator]]s, etc) are native to the plane of [[Xoriat]], and were part of the initial incursion of the [[daelkyr]] into Eberron along with other [[aberration]]s from the plane of madness. They are closely associated with the daelkyr known as [[Belashyrra]], the Lord of Eyes.

!! Birth of a Beholder

Beholders can produce others of their own kind, but the
process has nothing to do with biology and everything to do with psychology.

When a beholder sleeps, its body goes briefly dormant
but its mind never stops working. The creature is fully aware, even though to an outside observer it might appear oblivious of its surroundings. Sometimes a beholder's dreams (which take place in [[Xoriat]], not [[Dal Quor]]) are dominated by images of itself or of other beholders (which might or might not actually exist). On extremely rare occasions when a beholder dreams of
another beholder, the act creates a warp in realityâ€”from
which a new, fully formed beholder springs forth unbidden, seemingly having appeared out of thin air in a nearby space. This "offspring" might be a duplicate of
the beholder that dreamed it into existence, or it could
take the form of a different variety of beholder-kin, such as a
[[death kiss]] or a [[gazer]]. It might also be a truly unique creature, such as could be spawned only from the twisted imagination of a beholder, with
a set of magical abilities unlike that of its parent.

!! Physical Characteristics

As a byproduct of their unique method of propagation,
beholders in one part of the world tend to look similar,
with variations becoming more pronounced the farther
one travels from that area. Even a slight variation in the
shape of an eyestalk or the texture of its skin is enough
for one beholder to consider another a flawed abomination, which should be destroyed.
