        "text": "The [[Adarans]] and [[kalashtar]] are concentrated on the northern edge of [[Overlook]]. Adaran citizens have pooled their resources to\nrent a large hall, the Gathering Light, that serves as\nan anchor for the community. During the day, the\nhall functions as a school, where people come to study\nkalashtar martial arts and meditation techniques.\nIn the evenings, the people gather to celebrate their\nheritage. Activities at the gatherings vary considerably. Some nights song, dance, or other forms of\nart play a dominate role, while other nights involve\nserious discussions of philosophy, metaphysics, or\ncurrent events.\n\nSelkatari is a master of the [[Path of Shadows]] and oversees martial training and monastic discipline at the Gathering Light, while Hanamelk serves as the resident scholar\nand sage. These two also work together to protect the\ncommunity from crime and violence, using diplomacy\nwhen possible and force when reason fails. ",
