Relatively\nspartan and reasonably priced, the Golden Wing\nis partly underground and smells of damp earth.\nThough cheaper lodging is available in the [[Temple District]], the\nGolden Wing has the advantage of being a safer place,\nits staff having no patience for customers getting their\npockets picked or being cheated at cards or dice.",
