        "text": "The Moon Breaker was a weapon of cataclysmic power during the [[Age of Giants]]. Developed by the [[Sulat League]], the Moon Breaker was used by the [[Cul'sir Dominion|Cul'sir]] during the [[quori]] invasion over forty thousand years ago to destroy the moon [[Crya]] and seal off the [[plane]] of [[Dal Quor]] from [[Eberron]]. \n\nAccording to the oldest surviving writings of the time, the weapon was a \"vast altar of obsidian and brass\", and was housed in a giant forgehold known as ''Karul'tash''.\n\nIn truth, the Moon Breaker still stands, hidden deep in the jungles of [[Xen'drik]]. Within the massive hollow tower of Karul'tash, an obsidian column hovers in the air, covered with glowing sigils and inlaid with a variety of different metals and gemstones. Dozens of rings float around the central pillar, rising and falling as they spin in different directions. Finally, twelve crystal orbs drift around the pillar, each mystically connected to a [[moon]] and a [[plane]] of existence. The thirteenth orb, representing [[Crya]], was destroyed by the machine, which in turn destroyed that moon and severed Eberron's direct planar link to [[Dal Quor]]. This was the largest-scale use of [[sympathetic magic|Sympathetic Theory]] in history.",
