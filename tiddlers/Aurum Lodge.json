        "text": "The [[Aurum]] claims to be a society for wealthy students\nof history. As such, it is hardly surprising that it\nmaintains a small chapterhouse in [[Stormhaven]], where\nexperienced explorers are invited to speak about their\nexperiences. [[Jaris Cantar]], a shipping magnate who runs a trading fleet\nunder license to [[Lyrandar]], owns the lodge.\n\nThree members of the Platinum Concord reside\nin [[Stormreach]], including [[Jaris Cantar]], and twelve\nmembers of the Gold Concord. Most are entrepreneurs or collectors, interested in the opportunities that lie in the interior; others are the descendants of\nthe pirate captains bullied into submission by the first\n[[Storm Lords]]. Next to Cantar, the most influential\nvoice is that of [[Guldan Soldorak]].\n\nThe [[Aurum]] has another weapon in [[Stormreach]], the gang known as the [[Golden Lions]]. Many of the gang’s members are children of Aurum families; [[Jacques the Hook]] is actually Jacques Cantar. Adventurers could easily be employed by a Concordian, but if they become an obstacle, they might be “fed to the Lions.”",
