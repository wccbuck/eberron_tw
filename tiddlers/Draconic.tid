Draconic (or "Celestial") is the [[immortal]] [[language]] of [[celestial]]s and [[dragon]]s. It is named for its common use among dragons, but the dragons themselves learned this speech from the [[couatl]] during the [[Age of Demons]]. It is spoken across the [[plane]]s by [[celestial]]s, including the warriors of [[Justice]] in [[Shavarath]], the [[dominion]]s of [[Syrania]], and the [[Architect]]s of [[Irian]]. Many scholars refer to Draconic as the "language of [[Siberys]]". It forms the foundation of many systems of [[arcane|arcane magic]] incantation; as a result, many [[wizard]]s and [[artificer]]s understand Draconic, and may know a few words in it, but are not actually fluent in it.

Influences from Draconic can be found in the mortal [[language]]s [[Argon]], [[Giant]], [[Yipyak]], and [[Orcish]].
