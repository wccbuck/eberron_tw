title: gleaner
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A gleaner possesses the supernatural gift to interact with the natural world. Their [[magic|primal magic]] is similar to that of the [[druid]], but more limited. A gleaner cannot choose their magical abilities: these blessings are the gifts of nature, and must be discovered and honed over time. 

In some regions, "gleaner" is a term of respect, and the bearer is celebrated for their gifts: such gleaners travel between hamlets and thorps, bringing good weather, blessing the harvest, and serving as midwives and medics. However, other gleaners follow other professions, and use their magical gifts for personal gain. A stableboy who finds that he has the gift to speak to animals may go on to become a master trainer, who can calm the wildest beast with his whispered words. A massive farm may have a host of gleaners who use the [[farmhand]], [[blessed birth]], or [[sow]] spells to keep operations running like clockwork, producing food for the nearby metropolis. 

!! Talenta Gleaners

Gleaners in the [[Talenta Plains]] often can cast spells with [[enchantment]] or [[illusion]] effects, due to their relationship with [[fey]] primal spirits. They also have developed versions of [[animal friendship]], [[animal messenger]], [[beast bond]], [[beast sense]], [[summon familiar]] and [[speak with animals]] specific to reptiles, and work closely with the [[thunder lizard|dinosaur]]s of that region. See also [[spirit rider]].
