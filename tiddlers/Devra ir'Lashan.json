She commands a small, mixed unit comprised of members of all branches of the Citadel. Her team serves both to protect [[Argonth]] itself—providing counterintelligence and watching out for any infiltrators—and stands ready for covert operations in [[Droaam]]. Ir’Lashan is competent and calm. Her loyalty is to [[Breland]] above all else, and she will sacrifice anything and anyone in pursuit of her duty.",
