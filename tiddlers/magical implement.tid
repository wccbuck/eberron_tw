title: magical implement
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A magical implement is a [[magic item]] that serves as a focus for spellcasting. An implement can enhance the effects of certain categories of spells, or even grant the spellcaster access to spells they don't ordinarily have the ability to cast. Some implements allow casting spells using magical energy imbued in the item itself, rather than the spellcaster's; these items usually can only be used a few times per day.

''Wands'', ''staffs'', and ''rods'' are primarily
associated with [[human]] cultures in [[Eberron]]. Both
the [[giant]]s of [[Xen'drik]] and the [[elves|elf]] of [[Aerenal]]
occasionally use scepters as a form of focus, and
although some have adapted the practice, it was
the humans of [[Sarlona]] who first made the wand
a staple and brought it to [[Khorvaire]]. Primarily
an offensive tool that amplifies the aggressive
energies of a spell, wands of naturally magical
woods have been known to increase the potential
of [[evocation]] spells. In Khorvaire, people
recognize wands, staffs, and rods as weapons
and assume the carrier know how to use it.
Those who wave wands around might cause a
panic as if pointing a crossbow at someone and
is likely to find either, or both, aimed squarely
back at them.

''Orbs'' and ''crystals'' (typically [[Siberys dragonshard|dragonshard]]s) have been used as magical implements for far longer than wands. Itâ€™s thought that the [[dragon]]s were the first to employ these tools as arcane focuses, but they are also found in the ruins of [[Xen'drik]] and are the primary focuses used in the nation of [[Aerenal]]. 

''Holy symbols'' are representations of [[deities|deity]] or other ideals of a particular [[religion]], used as magical implements by wielders of [[divine magic]]. A holy symbol might be an amulet depicting a symbol of the faith, an engraving on a shield, a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic, or any number of objects that hold sacred meaning.
