type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

His wild eyes peering out from his tangled hair and beard, Yannick Drumdoom lingers near the [[Old Catacombs]] in [[Stormreach]]. Smeared with ashes, Yannick has devoted
himself to the [[Keeper]], god of death, and beats his drum day and night, reciting the names of the dead and collecting tokens from tombs to keep their spirits closer to this world. He is clearly insane and makes passersby uncomfortable.
