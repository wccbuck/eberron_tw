Home to the great [[shifter]] nations of [[Sarlona]],\nthe Tundra consists mainly of grassy, treeless plains that\nstretch without interruption from horizon to horizon.\nFor many thousands of years, these [[semi-nomadic tribes|Culture of the Tashana shifters]]\nhave roamed the grasslands, isolated from the rest of the\nworld and left in relative peace to contemplate the cold,\npure spirit of their ancestral homeland. \n\n!! Land of Many Waters\n\nTashana means \"many waters\" in an ancient, nearly extinct\n[[shifter]] dialect. The plains are dotted with hundreds,\nif not thousands, of small glacial lakes. Many of these\nremain frozen year-round, but the southern waters thaw\nin summer. In these months, the Tundra is a place of pure\nand unspoiled natural beauty. The landscapes are regularly interrupted by huge mounds of rocks and boulders, some miles wide, that seem to have fallen from the sky.\nRemnants, presumably, of an earlier glacial age, these rock\nmounds have a strange and otherworldly beauty.\n\nThe majority of the Tundra is covered with frosty\ngrasslands. To the north the [[Eska Mountains]] rise, and\nthe northern foothills of the [[Paqaa Mountains]] encroach\nupon the southern border. In the far north, the dreamlike and ghostly [[Tashyvar Islands]] reach into the [[Sea of Rage]]. Finally, the mysterious [[Krertok Peninsula]] extends\nnortheast of the Eskas.\n\nThe climate is mainly subarctic, with true arctic conditions in the northern plains and mountains, and short\nsummer months of near-temperate conditions in the south.\nIf anything definitive can be said of the Tundra as a whole, it\nis this—it is a land of strange weather. Blizzards, snow squalls,\nand whiteouts sometimes descend in an instant, but also\ncommon are strange heat waves, downpours of inexplicably\nwarm rain, and savage lightning strikes.\n\nThe southern border of the Tashana region is marked by a gradual elevation shift and what appears to be an intermittent [[manifest zone]]\ntied to the [[plane]] of [[Risia]]. All along these borderlands, planar manifestations of ice and snow have\ngiven the appearance of a land of perpetual winter to\nthose south of the border. This geographical isolation\nhas resulted in a land that is remarkably insular and\nself-sustaining.\n\nThe Tundra is well known for [[reality storm]]s (//aukarak//s\nin the ancient [[shifter]] dialect), rogue planar breaches and\nmanifest zones that drift over the landscape.\n\n!! Getting There\n\nAlthough no more difficult to travel to than other locales,\nthe Tashana Tundra had few visitors in the past. The austere beauty of the place and its peoples drew little interest.\nRecently, however, things have changed. \n\nIntercontinental trade on a significant scale has\ndeveloped on the western Tashana coastline. Exports of\nmedicinal and magical lichens from the Tashanan interior have resulted in expansion of the port communities of\n[[Winterstead]] and [[Whitetooth]], at the respective openings of\nthe [[Qonama|Qonama River]] and [[Tiiki|Tiiki River]] rivers. Although the Tundra does\nproduce some unique herbs and spices, the true reason for\nthis rapid growth is less savory—coastal Tashana produces\na particularly potent strain of the fatigue-alleviating\nlichen known as muqqa, or [[icewild]]. Also, Tashana [[shifter]]\nart is currently in vogue among a few wealthy collectors in\n[[Zilargo]]. As a result, there's a great demand for brave souls\nwilling to discover and barter for genuine artworks. \n\nRecent years have also seen a significant influx of\n[[shifter]]s from [[Khorvaire]]—both individual pilgrims and\nentire communities. Khorvairian shifters have been arriving by boat in greater numbers since the end of the\n[[Last War]], with charismatic leaders often at the head of\nentire naval convoys of pilgrims. Individual shifters\nmight want to travel to Tashana for personal or spiritual\nreasons; other characters might sign on as escorts and\ndefenders of the larger shifter migrations.\n\nAnd as with any place, not all visitors arrive by\nchoice. The [[Akiak]] people maintain their community-in-exile in the northern foothills of the [[Paqaa Mountains]]. While the shifters of the southern [[Qiku]] are careful not to\novertly oppose the [[Riedrans]], they are providing material\nsupport to the Akiak fighters and harboring some civilian communities.\n\nInternal travel is not difficult despite the lack of good\nroads. [[Shifter|shifter]] and [[dwarf]] communities have long traded\namong themselves, and limited trade exists between the\nshifters and the northern border communities of [[Riedra]].\n\n!! State of the Region\n\nThe Tashana Tundra is better understood as a geographical\nregion rather than a nation. Although the Tashana [[shifter]]s\nare the dominant people in terms of a semi-unified culture (and sheer numbers), they do not recognize political borders, and they have no diplomats or delegations abroad.\nThe [[dwarves|dwarf]] of the [[Dorann Holds]] are closer to being an\nactual political nation, but their isolationist policies have\nkept them all but invisible in their distant mountain holds.\nThe [[Akiak]] refugees and the [[Icebinder|Icebinders]] [[frost giant]]s remain\nessentially nomadic peoples, and little is known of the\nmysterious [[Inana]] [[maenad]]s. The Tashana Tundra is simply\ntoo big, too wild, and too sparsely populated to qualify as a\nnation in any but the loosest sense of that term.\n\n!!! Shifter Nations\n\nThe [[Qiku]] and [[Saartuk]] nations are\ncomposed of hundreds of individual tribes, each led by a\ncouncil of elders. The tribe is the basic organizational unit\nof the [[shifter]] people, and each functions more or less independently. Each tribe has one or more shamans—healers and\nspiritual councilors. In the north, the desperate and more\nwarlike [[Chuniigi]] are more fractured and entirely nomadic,\nfollowing the herds of caribou and competing with the many\nhuman tribes in the area.\n\nThe three nations have enjoyed a state of relative peace\nfor many decades. The great wars of the past had been devastating for all, and the Tundra is too harsh a land to spill\nunnecessary blood. Twice a year, each nation holds a gathering of its internal tribes and once a year, representatives\nfrom the three nations convene a Summit Council at a\nsecret location in the central plains known as the Speaking\nStones (not to be confused with [[Sivis]] [[speaking stone]]s). Recent threats by the [[Kalaak]] barbarians have tribal\nleaders uniting in common defense, and a semipermanent\nSummit Council has gathered for several years now. The Council is led by a triumvirate known as the Sky Tellers,\nwith each of the three great nations represented. Among\nall three nations, adults of any gender are hunters\nand fighters, and in times of war, each nation is capable of\nfielding an army of fighters on very short notice.\n\nSee also [[Culture of the Tashana shifters]].\n\n!!!

Foreign Relations\n\nAmong the various peoples of the Tundra, relations are\ngenerally peaceful. The [[shifter]] nations keep to themselves,\nhaving successfully averted large-scale war for hundreds of\nyears. Isolated tribal skirmishes still occur regularly when\nresources become scarce, particularly involving the warlike\n[[Chuniigi]] tribes of the north.\n\nIn recent years, the refugee people of the [[Akiak]] and\nthe tribal leaders of the [[Qiku]] shifter nation have joined in alliance. This alliance has historical roots: When the\nAkiak split from their [[Dorann|Dorann Holds]] forefathers hundreds of\nyears ago, the shifters of the Qiku nation helped the\ndwarves in their migration from the [[Eska Mountains]]\nacross the Tashana Tundra. After the Akiak established\ntheir new clanholds in the [[Paqaa Mountains]], the two\ngroups remained friendly and engaged in significant\ntrade. After the betrayal of the [[Inspired]], the Qiku shifters provided refuge and shelter to the desperate Akiak\nrefugees in the northern foothills of the mountains,\nwhere they remain to this day. While there is no formal\nmilitary alliance, the Qiku provide Akiak guerrilla raiders with supplies and mercenary warriors to assist in their\ncampaign to retake clanholds in the Paqaa range.\n\nAlong the western coast of the Tashana, the [[Saartuk]]\nnation coexists with colonies established by\nthe [[Inana]] [[maenad]]s of the [[Tashyvar Islands]].\nThere is certainly no shortage of space\nor resources along that shoreline.\nThe port communities of [[Winterstead]] and [[Whitetooth]] are an\nintriguing mix of [[maenad]] and\n[[shifter]] culture, along with a\nsmattering of various [[Khorvarian|Khorvaire]] influences brought by\nincreasing sea trade. \n\nIn the far north, lowlying [[Dorann|Dorann Holds]] clans have\na tradition of trading\nworked metal and weapons\nwith the [[Chuniigi]], typically for prepared meats\nand animal products.\nHowever, relations have\nsoured in recent years.\nThe Chuniigi are enduring relentless raids by the\nsavage [[Kalaak]] barbarians,\nand these are desperate times\nfor the northernmost [[shifter]]\nnation. Chuniigi now regularly\nraid Dorann [[dwarf]] settlements,\nand even northern roaming [[Qiku]]\nand [[Saartuk]] tribes when necessary. \n\nThe nomadic [[Icebinder|Icebinders]] giants generally have good relations\nwith all three [[shifter]] nations, in that\nthey leave one another alone. The scattered and self-sufficient [[human]] barbarian tribes of the Tundra have no overarching organization, and conflict arises\nonly when competition for resources heats up.\n\nThe human barbarians known as the [[Kalaak]] are an\nentirely different matter. Of these terrible raiders, little\nis known—and of that, little is spoken. Some say the savagery of the Kalaak has earned them a reputation entirely\nout of proportion to their actual power and numbers.\nThere is no doubt, however, that the Kalaak represent a\ngrave threat to all peoples of the Tashana.\n\n!!! Riedra\n\n[[Riedra]] and Tashana have long had a mutually beneficial\npolicy of ignoring one another's existence. It's unclear to\nwhat extent the [[shifter]] leaders know of the Riedran government, and all indications are that the [[Inspired]] consider the\nshifter nations harmless primitives. Several passes break\nthrough the strange planar-influenced border between\nthe lands of Tashana and Riedra, and limited trade exists\nbetween individual shifter tribes of the southern Tundra\nand northern [[Riedran|Riedrans]] settlements—proximity trumps\npolitics in these cases. The upper reaches of the [[Paqaa Mountains]] represents a significant exception, due to direct\nhostilities between the refugee [[Akiak]] fighters and [[Riedra]]n\noccupiers. Although there exists no state of war between\nRiedra and the [[Qiku]], it is common knowledge that the\nshifters support the Akiak in their struggle to reclaim their\nhomeland. Tashana tribes and [[Riedran military|Taskaan Legion]] shifters\nharbor a deep enmity toward one another. Extremely bloody\nincidents in the past have led the leaders of both Riedra\nand the Tundra nations to avoid direct conflict. \n\n!!! Syrkarn and Adar\n\nTashanans are, for the\nmost part, unaware of the\ndistant nations of [[Syrkarn]]\nand [[Adar]]. It's probable, however, that leaders of the shifter\nnations have some knowledge\nof these lands. In fact, there\nare those who suspect that\nemissaries have been dispatched in both directions,\nand that secret talks are under\nway to assess a possible alliance\nagainst [[Riedra]].\n\n!!! Other Nations\n\nIt's a fact known to only a select\nfew, but Tashanan coastal communities and pirates of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] have maintained secret trading and smuggling routes\nacross the [[Lhazaar Sea]] for many years.\nInitial trade was probably in certain\nexotic spices native to the Tashana coast,\nbut much of the commerce now revolves\naround trafficking of medicinal and magical lichens, especially [[icewild]]. Other\ncommodities include native Tashanan art,\nand mineral and crystal exports from the [[Eskas|Eska Mountains]]. ",
