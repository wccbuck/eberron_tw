        "text": "Great Druid Oalian, ruler of the [[Eldeen Reaches]] and leader of the [[Wardens of the Wood]], is like no other creature in [[Eberron]]. Some claim they were once a tree, [[awaken]]ed by powerful magic wielded by the original [[Gatekeepers]]. Others say Oalian is the first tree, as old as the world. If Oalian knows the truth of their origin, they do not share it. (In truth, Oalian is the mightiest and most famous of the [[guardian tree]]s.)\n\nAt the center of [[Greenheart]] stands the Great Druid's Grove. Trees and [[treant]]s form a ring around a pool of mirror-still water where the Great Druid channels the [[primal power|primal magic]] that enriches the land.\n\nOalian is a 250-foot-high greatpine, and he is anchored to his spot in the Great Druid's Grove. However, if he ever feels the need, he can animate a smaller [[treant]] vessel, operating it remotely as an avatar. ",
