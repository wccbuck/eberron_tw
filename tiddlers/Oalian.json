Some claim he was once a tree, [[awaken]]ed by powerful magic wielded by the original [[Gatekeepers]]. Others say he is the first tree, as old as the world. If Oalian knows the truth of his origin, he does not share it.\n\nAt the center of [[Greenheart]] stands the Great Druid's grove. Trees and [[treant]]s form a ring around a pool of mirror-still water where the Great Druid channels the primal power that enriches the land.",
