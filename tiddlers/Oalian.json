Some claim they were once a tree, [[awaken]]ed by powerful magic wielded by the original [[Gatekeepers]]. Others say Oalian is the first tree, as old as the world. If Oalian knows the truth of their origin, they do not share it. (In truth, Oalian is the mightiest and most famous of the [[guardian tree]]s.)\n\nAt the center of [[Greenheart]] stands the Great Druid's grove. Trees and [[treant]]s form a ring around a pool of mirror-still water where the Great Druid channels the primal power that enriches the land.",
