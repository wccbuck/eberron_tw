        "text": "The Dagger River is the enormous river that leads into the [[Thunder Sea]] in the south, through the Hilt, a large natural harbor that serves the city of [[Sharn]]. The river originates near the town of [[Woodhelm]] in the [[Dragonwood]], passing by the port town of [[Galethspyre]] as it winds southward. The rich sky-blue dye known as //sayda//, more commonly known as \"[[Brelish blue|Culture of Breland]],\" is made from shellfish found only in the waters of the Dagger.\n\nA small community of [[locathah]] dwell in the Hilt region of the river.",
