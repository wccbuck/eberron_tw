A demonic [[overlord]] could be sealed beneath the ruined [[yuan-ti]] city of Sustrai Mor in [[Khunan]], [[Syrkarn]]. The [[eneko]] [[Karrak]] cults are said to be numerous within the wasted plain that surrounds the ruins. Among the [[Syrk|Syrks]] nomads, the city has a reputation for being haunted or overrun with secret sects of [[yuan-ti]].
