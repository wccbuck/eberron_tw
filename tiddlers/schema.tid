Schemas are form of magical blueprint, providing instructions and magical frameworks for the creation of [[magic item]]s and other magical effects. Unlike something like a [[spell scroll]], a schema can be used to reproduce a magical effect repeatedly, which makes them extremely valuable and essential to [[Khorvaire]]'s magical economy. 

Ancient schemas dating back to the [[Age of Giants]] have been used to pass magical knowledge through the generations. An individual schema from the ruins of [[Xen'drik]] might be a few sigils carved into a stone tablet, or an elaborate scripted presentation on the torso of a long-dead [[quorcraft]]. 

House [[Cannith]] also holds the secrets for creating new schemas, which has allowed them to solidify their control over the magical manufacturing industry (though many of these secrets were lost in the [[Mourning]]). A minor Cannith schema holding a single [[spell]] effect might be a flat strip of some durable material (commonly metal or wood) approximately two inches wide and a foot or more long, with carved or etched runes covering its face. Schemas that store simple magical properties might appear fairly simple, whereas a schema recording an [[epic-tier|spell tier]] spell might have hundreds of components incorporated within its mystical diagram.

In most cases, an individual schema represents a specific magical building block. These blocks can be combined into magical patterns, storing power ranging from simple [[cantrips|spell tier]] to world-shaking destruction. A House [[Cannith]] [[magewright]] might use a simple pattern to quickly create hundreds of [[continual flame]] stones for use in street lamps, even as agents of the [[Emerald Claw]] seek to assemble a pattern for an [[eldritch machine]] that can replicate the destruction of [[Cyre]].

In terms of cost, schemas are typically considered one [[rarity]] tier higher than the magical effect they can create.
