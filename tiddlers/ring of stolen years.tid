This solid black band has a humanoid molar set in the center. The ring allows the user to absorb health from a creature within 10 feet, siphoning their living essence to heal the wearer's wounds (moderate-[[impact]] [[magical healing]]). This effect can be used once per day, or more times if in a [[Mabar]] [[manifest zone]].
