        "text": "The Kraken's Wake is a [[Windwrights Guild]] ship captained by ''Helias Lyrandar''. The black-and-silver ship runs a route between [[Sharn]] and [[Stormreach]], typically setting off from Greenman Pier in [[Sharn's Welcome]]. Its main sail is emblazoned with the [[kraken]] emblem of House [[Lyrandar]], and is bound with an [[air elemental]], ensuring that the ship always has favorable wind. While not as fast as an [[elemental galleon]], the Kraken's Wake's windsail makes for a quick voyage.\n\nCaptain Helias always pays for a [[sahuagin]] guide to safely navigate the [[Straits of Shargon]], but his crew typically tosses a small offering to the [[Devourer]] overboard, just in case.",
