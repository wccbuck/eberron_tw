Arnaarlasha was an ancient [[gold dragon]] of the [[Warders]] who, during the destruction of [[Io'vakas]], rescued and defended around a thousand refugees and founded the nearby city of [[Io'lokar]]. Her death 400 years ago prompted a coordinated attack on the city from a host of [[rogue dragon]]s, but the magical defenses she helped erect helped the inhabitants fend off the siege. The Battle of Arnaarlashaâ€™s Fall is celebrated to this day in Io'lokar. The [[Arnaaracaex]], or Swords of Arnaarlasha, are a band of [[stone giant]]s who faithfully serve the city in her memory.
