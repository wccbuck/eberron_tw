Some [[magic item]]s bear curses that bedevil their users, sometimes long after a user has stopped using an item. Most methods of identifying items fail to reveal such a curse, although lore might hint at it. Attunement to a cursed item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with the [[remove curse]] spell.
