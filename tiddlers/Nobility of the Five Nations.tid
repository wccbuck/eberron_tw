title: Nobility of the Five Nations
tooltip: an examination of nobility traditions across Khorvaire
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The kingdom of [[Galifar]] was built on a framework of feudalism. All power and authority flowed from the [[Wynarn|Wynarn family]] monarch, who was chosen to lead by [[Aureon]] himself; that power flowed through the princes and princesses that governed the land, and then down through local nobles and administrators. In this way, the nobility remained the foundation of the kingdom throughout its history. 

Nobles were responsible for maintaining their territory, including collecting taxes, raising levies for military and national service, and appointing justices and mayors. Over time, these responsibilities grew more complicated, leading to the creation of a class of dedicated civil servants and landowners—initially viscounts and crown reeves, and ultimately expanding into gentry and merchant classes. But by the start of the [[Last War]], the majority of property was still associated with a noble's domain.

Today, the nobility is still actively involved in governance throughout the [[Five Nations]], but has lost much of its power.

!! Noble Ranks and Titles

The following titles were instituted by [[Galifar I|Galifar Wynarn]], and remain the common ranks of nobility to this day, listed in descending order of status. This also reflects the practical reality of land ownership and chain of command. A crown reeve holds territory within a county, and is responsible to a count. Counties are tied to duchies, and counts are bound to dukes. Anyone holding one of the ranks given below is allowed to use the //ir’// prefix with their surname.

* ''King'' or ''Queen''. The monarch and ruler of the united kingdom of [[Galifar]]. After the [[Treaty of Thronehold]], the ruler of one of the [[Five Nations]].
* ''Prince'' or ''Princess''. A child of the king or queen. As a governor of a nation (pre-[[Last War]]), uses the title "Prince(ss) of (Nation)."
* ''Archduke'' or ''Archduchess''. A duke or duchess married to a prince or princess.
* ''Grand Duke'' or ''Grand Duchess''. A duke or duchess governing a palatine region (see below).
* ''Duke'' or ''Duchess''. The ruler of a duchy. In the early days of [[Galifar]], and in modern-day [[Karrnath]], this title is synonymous with "Warlord."
* ''Count'' or ''Countess''. The ruler of a county. Rulers of counties seen as dangerous border regions are called ''Shield''s, and are often held in higher regard.
* ''Viscount'' or ''Viscountess''. An appointed, nonhereditary title typically granted by a count or duke to a person performing important administrative duties within their domain.
* ''Crown Reeve''. The lowest rank of nobility, crown reeves typically administer lands within a county; however, this title was often given to members of the gentry who purchased lands from the crown. This rank can be hereditary, but is often tied to service.

The balance of power between duchies would regularly shift over the course of [[Galifar]]'s history due to the kingdom's convoluted traditions of succession; the rise of each new monarch displaced governing princes, and each prince's marriage displaced an archduke.

Note that there is a distinction between //courtesy titles//, which carry respect and prestige but no authority over any domain, and //substantive titles//, which are associated with land and the duties of maintaining it. Eldest children of dukes might use the title of count or countess, but such titles are merely courtesies, and the heir has no actual authority. Likewise, an important administrator might be granted a courtesy title to reflect their service, but no land would be tied to that title. Typically courtesy titles are tied to the holder and cannot be transferred to heirs.

Knighthood in the [[Five Nations]] is an honor, not a title of nobility (even a courtesy title). Traditionally, dukes or higher nobles can appoint knights; the title carries status, as it reflects service to the nation, but it isn't tied to inheritance or land.

!!! Grand Duchies

Grand dukes are rulers of palatinates, more typically referred to as grand duchies. These are regions recognized as holding a degree of independence from the surrounding nation and having a direct relationship with the monarch, thus having the right to enforce local laws and practice customs that might be at odds with those of the surrounding nation. 

The first palatinate was the Grand Duchy of [[Atur]] in [[Karrnath]], but the most significant palatinates were the three that formed [[Zilargo]]. When the armies of Galifar passed the [[Howling Peaks]], they met with Zil diplomats who negotiated the incorporation of the region into the overall mantle of [[Breland]], but as three grand duchies. Thus, Zilargo became part of [[Galifar]], while still maintaining nearly complete autonomy. The three grand duchies of Zilargo were [[Zolanberg]], [[Trolanport]], and [[Korranberg]]. 

Today, there are still three noble families of [[Zilargo]]—the ir'Korrans, the ir'Trolans, and the ir'Zolans—and heirs happily compete for the title of Grand Duke and hold elaborate coronations. However, the title is a symbolic role holding no real authority; the [[Triumvirate]], the Councils of Nine, and the [[Trust]] actually maintain the nation.

!! Gaining a Title

Under the traditions of [[Galifar]], a hereditary title passes to the oldest child of the title-holder regardless of gender. If there is no living heir, it passes to the siblings of the noble or their heirs; failing that, it falls to the noble who oversees the domain to reassign it. A number of royal lines were lost in the [[Last War]] (or convicted of treason and stripped of rank), so there are dukes with counties to dispense, and counts in need of qualified crown reeves. 

In most of the nations of [[Khorvaire]], only the monarch can create a new title. Lesser nobles can assign vacant substantive titles within their domains, though this requires the approval of the monarch. Many domains are associated with a specific set of courtesy titles that can be dispensed at the discretion of the local noble.

In addition, across the [[Five Nations]], it is illegal for anyone to sell a title, whether it is their own or a domain within their jurisdiction. [[Breland]] is a notable exception to this rule, as was [[Karrnath]] during a brief period of financial desperation in the middle years of the [[Last War]]; the [[Aurum]]'s [[Antus ir'Soldorak]] famously purchased his noble title, "Master of Coin," during these years.

!!! Noble Marriage

A person who marries into a noble family is known as a consort. They may be granted a courtesy title, but hold no real power, nor do they automatically inherit their spouse's title or authority when their spouse dies. As an example, [[Kaius III|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] of [[Karrnath]] is married to [[Etrigani]], an [[Aereni]] [[elf]]. As long as Kaius is alive, Etrigani carries the courtesy title of Queen. When Kaius dies, however, the crown of Karrnath would pass to Kaius's eldest child (if any), not to Etrigani. If they have no children, Kaius's sister [[Haydith|Haydith ir'Wynarn]] would take the crown. A spouse could serve as a regent while waiting for a child to come of age, but they can’t claim the title as their own. This tradition prevents long-lived races such as [[elves|elf]] from marrying into a family of [[human]] nobles and holding the title for centuries.

While many nobles limit themselves to a single consort, this isn’t enforced by law. A monarch could have multiple consorts, and the child of any official consort would be considered an heir. For a lengthy period in [[Galifar]]'s history, it was accepted tradition for a reigning monarch to have a consort from each of the [[Five Nations]], in part to spread out the burden of producing five heirs. In the wake of the [[Last War]], some of the nobles have continued this tradition; the aforementioned [[Kaius III|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] of [[Karrnath]] maintains a harem, though only [[Etrigani]] carries the title of queen. (A Wynarn queen traditionally might opt to appoint one or more of her siblings as royal surrogates to produce eligible heirs.) On the other side of the coin, Queen [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]] of [[Aundair]] has a [[single consort|Sasik d'Vadalis]], but has not granted him any title.

!!! Dragonmarked Houses

The [[Korth Edicts]] prevent members of [[dragonmarked house]]s from owning land or holding noble titles. If a member of the nobility marries a dragonmarked heir, one or both of them must sever all legal ties to their family. For the dragonmarked, this includes changing their family name. Notably, [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]]'s consort [[Sasik d'Vadalis]] has kept his [[Vadalis]] name, in defiance of the Edicts. In the aftermath of the [[Last War]] and the dissolution of the kingdom of [[Galifar]], a growing number of legal scholars believe the [[Korth Edicts]] to be obsolete and unenforceable.

!! Nobility in the Five Nations

Even while [[Galifar]] was united, the [[Five Nations]] had their own unique nobility traditions, and over the course of the last century, these traditions have diverged even further.

!!! Aundair

[[Aundair]] has held closely to the old traditions of [[Galifar]], and its people have a romantic view of the nobility. The common folk value self-reliance and ambition, but most believe that the nobility is noble in all senses of the word, that their leaders will do what’s best for the country and for their people. Aundairian nobles have high standards of honor and duty, and crass or selfish behavior reflect poorly on their families. Nobles are also expected to possess some level of [[arcane|arcane magic]] talent.

Aundair uses the standard noble ranks of [[Galifar]], but accomplished [[arcane|arcane magic]] spellcasters will often add a title that describes their primary school of magic, along with a designator indicating their mastery of that school. Thus, a noble might be introduced as //Alara ir'Lain, Countess of [[Askelios]], [[Diviner|divination]] of the Fourth Circle//.

[[Aundair]] has a large population of [[elves|elf]] and [[Khoravar|half-elf]], and these are folded into its noble families; there are also a few [[gnome]] noble families. Many of the oldest families with estates near [[manifest zone]]s to [[Thelanis]] claim to have ancient agreements with [[fey]], which range from formal pacts with an [[archfey]] to a simple understanding with a [[dryad]] who dwells in the local wood. Some families also have secret ties to the [[Queen of Shadows|Sul Khatesh]], who is bound beneath Aundair. 

The [[Eldeen Reaches]] seceded from [[Aundair]] in 958 YK, and the Eldeen Charter abolished noble ownership of land and granted it to the people. While some nobles of these reclaimed lands stayed and worked to become community leaders without the titles and privileges of their former lives, many fled east to [[Aundair]], becoming the disenfranchised "Lost Lords."

!!! Breland

The kingdom of [[Wroat]] was founded by reavers and bandits, and its rulers held their power through a blend of charisma, cunning, and force. Wroat was a loose confederation of city-states, destined to ultimately fall to [[Galifar]]’s disciplined forces; those leaders who wisely chose to ally with the invader became the nobles of the newly-forged [[Breland]].

While Breland accepted the feudal structure of Galifar, its people never fully embraced the nobility, and certainly never bought into the idea of divine bloodlines. As Breland was an active frontier for centuries, the shield lords of the west were far more practical than the grand lords of [[Aundair]]. The nobles directed military action and administered the resources of the crown, but relied on the common folk to appoint their own reeves and lesser officials, and even resolve simple matters of justice themselves rather than go to the courts.

Throughout [[Breland]]'s history, nobles needed to work to maintain the respect of their subjects, not merely rely on tradition to keep them in place. As long as they respect their leaders, Brelish are proud and loyal; but Breland has also seen more minor uprisings than any of the other [[Five Nations]]. The [[Breland Parliament]] existed before the [[Last War]], and was established as a representative body that advised the Prince of Breland. At the outbreak of the War, Princess [[Wroann ir'Wynarn]] promised to make Breland a place where “people would be judged by word and deed instead of social class.” In [[895 YK|Khorvaire calendar]], Wroann granted greater powers to the Parliament, granting it the authority it has today. King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] is an exceptionally popular ruler, but there is a strong movement that believes that the Brelish monarchy should come to an end with Boranel’s reign—or at least be relegated to a purely symbolic position.

[[Breland]] uses the traditional noble ranks of [[Galifar]], but with a large number of shields, especially west of the [[Dagger River]]. Even though most of these counties have been secure for centuries, the shield lords still take pride in their titles and the deeds of their ancestors. Members of the Nobles Chamber of [[Breland Parliament]] are known as "Lords Parliament." Most cities and large communities have a council that manages local affairs, and in many counties these councils actually appoint viscounts, rather than the noble lord; for example, the [[Lord Mayor of Sharn]] is a viscount appointed by the [[city council|Sharn Council]].

Breland is the only one of the [[Five Nations]] that allows nobles to sell their titles and domains. Any such transaction must be approved by the monarch, who also takes a cut of the proceedings. The new noble is required to fulfill the duties of their position and the title can be stripped away should they fail. 

The ten dukes of [[Breland]] include Kenrou ir'Tallask, whose duchy includes [[Sharn]]; Laruna ir'Palaric, whose duchy (Brey Crossing) includes [[Starilaskur]]; and Tyror ir'Banath, whose duchy includes the town of [[Moonwatch]].

!!! Cyre

The conquest of [[Metrol]] was [[Galifar Wynarn]]’s first step in establishing his united kingdom. It was his bitterest enemy, and the realm that was most completely transformed in defeat. Hand-picked by Galifar I, the nobles of central [[Cyre]] were devoted to the ideals of the united kingdom and believed that they embodied those ideals. To realize his dreams for central Cyre, Galifar conquered the lands to the south and east to resettle the nobles of Metrol whom he displaced. These regions were largely ignored by the rest of the kingdom, and its nobles were allowed to rule their petty fiefdoms as they wished.

Following the outbreak of the [[Last War]], the [[Cyrans|Cyre]] continued to hold to the traditions of [[Galifar]]; after all, they were the rightful heirs of the true kingdom, and were fighting to defend it. Eastern and Southern Cyre were lost in the uprisings that formed [[Valenar]] and [[Darguun]], and then central Cyre fell in the [[Mourning]]. As a result, most Cyran nobles now have little but their pride. The [[Treaty of Thronehold]] established Cyre as a fallen nation, and its nobles had no voice in shaping the treaty. While King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] of [[Breland]] has granted Prince [[Oargev|Oargev ir'Wynarn]] the land now known as [[New Cyre]], the only power Cyran nobles now wield is what others choose to give them.

[[Cyre]] used the standard noble ranks of [[Galifar]]. Nobles of southern Cyre were often shields, as the land was taken from the [[goblin]]s and many conflicts arose over the centuries.

!!! Karrnath

The Karrns are a hard people who have always valued martial discipline and strict order. It was [[Karrn the Conqueror]] whose deeds secured human dominance over [[Khorvaire]], even though he failed to hold that power himself; and [[Galifar|Galifar Wynarn]] himself was a son of [[Karrnath]]. The [[Cyrans|Cyre]] believe that they are the rightful heirs of [[Galifar]] because of the traditions of succession, but the Karrns know that it was their people who //created// Galifar, their language that is now the [[common tongue|Common]].

In [[Karrnath]], the [[Galifar Code of Justice|Code of Galifar]] has been supplanted by the harsh [[Code of Kaius]], a form of martial law. This met little resistance and remains in place even today, in part because it reflects the overall character of the Karrns and their pre-Galifar culture. While there are certainly exceptions, most Karrns are proud of their strict laws and view the other nations as soft and corrupt. All Karrns serve a term in the military, further cementing their respect for order and the chain of command. The Karrnathi army fills many non-combat roles within the nation even during times of peace. Local law enforcement is largely provided by soldiers, with a small corps of career officers who maintain continuity of service. Soldiers also perform public works. A term in the army is a term of service to the nation—you must be prepared to go in harm’s way for the good of your people, but the precise form of that service is up to the monarch and the warlord.

Karrnath uses the standard noble ranks of [[Galifar]], though dukes often use the title of "Warlord." Nobles are expected to levy a specific number of troops for the service of the crown, but they may maintain additional forces as they see fit within their realms. In addition, troops sent to serve the crown are still expected to retain their loyalty to their duke.

!!! Thrane

[[Daskara]] was a nation devoted to the [[Sovereign Host]]. Like [[Galifar I|Galifar Wynarn]], the people of Daskara believed their rulers were blessed by the Sovereigns and governed with divine right. This faith was shaken by their defeats at the hands of Galifar’s forces, but Galifar I was able to convince most that his united kingdom was part of the divine plan, that their blessed lords were meant to kneel to the [[Wynarn|Wynarn family]] king; Galifar further strengthened this by establishing Daskara as the seat of the Grand Temple of the Host, the greatest temple in the lands. However, this new pillar was broken when the dragon [[Sarmondelaryx]] ravaged the newly christened [[Thrane]], killing its prince and burning the Grand Temple.

These challenges strained the faith of the Thranes, but the rise of [[Bel Shalor]] changed everything. It wasn’t a prince who saved the nation from terror, nor the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]]; it was [[a courageous warrior of lowly birth|Tira Miron]] strengthened by the power of the [[Silver Flame]]. In the years and centuries that followed, the people of [[Thrane]] largely abandoned the [[Sovereign Host]] and embraced the Silver Flame. The Grand Temple of the Host had been destroyed by the forces of [[Bel Shalor]], and the people chose to replace it with the citadel of [[Flamekeep]]; the [[Cathedral of the Sovereign Host|Cathedral on the Hill]] in [[Metrol]] became the new seat of the Vassal faith.

The nobles of [[Thrane]] had long touted their supposed divine blessing, but now the people had shifted away from the faith that supported it. Many nobles embraced the [[Silver Flame]], others attempted to balance both traditions, while a few clung bitterly to the old ways.

Following the death of King [[Thalin ir'Wynarn]] in 914 YK, [[Thrane]] officially became a theocracy led by the [[Keeper of the Flame]] and the [[Council of Cardinals]]. Lands once held through the crown were now considered property of the church, and civil and military administration were taken over by the church. The roles of viscounts and crown reeves were dissolved and taken over by church functionaries. Higher nobles were allowed to retain a single manor and estate, but no more. 

Today, Queen [[Diani ir'Wynarn]] serves in a decorative, ceremonial role. In theory, she is the Blood Regent and serves as adviser to the [[Keeper|Keeper of the Flame]] and the [[Cardinals|Council of Cardinals]]; in practice, she is ignored. Privately, Diani believes the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]] have plans for her, and loyalists known as Throneholders dream of restoring the monarchy to its rightful place.
