Endemic to the hot springs and calderas that dot the area around the [[Fist of Onatar]] in the [[Ironroot Mountains]], the tindul steamfish is most notable for the armored plates that cover their bodies and render them immune to the heat of their homes. Steamfish are considered pests by city planners of [[Solangap]], who loathe how often they become stuck in the turbines that power parts of the city.
