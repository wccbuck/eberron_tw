Low Giant (sometimes just called "Giant," not to be confused with the [[language group|Giant]] of the ancient titans of the [[Age of Giants]]) is the language spoken by [[giant]]s of [[Xen'drik]], which serves as a trade language in [[Stormreach]] and [[Zantashk]]. It descends from the [[Cul'sir]] variant of the old [[Giant]] language.
