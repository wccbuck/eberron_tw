The secrets behind the creation of the [[warforged]] go back nearly forty thousand years to the war between the [[giant]]s and the [[quori]]. During that conflict, the quori created
prototypical warforged, crafting a host of [[construct]]s
that bear a resemblance to modern warforged but are
distinctly different.

Some of these quorcraft warforged still lurk today in
the deepest recesses of the continent. Left to guard some
forgotten outpost or wandering without purpose, these
constructs are a danger to those who encounter them. All
who are not [[quori]] are enemies to the quorcraft, and they
attack without mercy or compassion.
