        "text": "Lathe, one of three Adamants of the [[Iron Watch]] of [[Stormreach]], is a mystery. They\nspend most of their time in meditation, and they have\nlearned to manipulate the [[warforged]] body in strange\nways. They have begun teaching these arts to some members of\nthe [[Iron Watch]], enabling them to extend\nspikes from their plating or sharpen the edge of their hands\nto a razor edge. Some say that Lathe wasn’t actually built by House [[Cannith]], and that they emerged from the dungeons beneath [[Stormreach]] after\nthe Iron Watch was established. Perhaps this is true,\nand Lathe is an [[ancient|quorcraft]] warforged trying to guide the\nmodern ’forged down a particular path.",
