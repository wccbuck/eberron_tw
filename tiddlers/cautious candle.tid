When you light this candle, it forms a protected area in a 100-foot radius sphere projected around the candle. It continues to burn until you put it out, until 8 hours pass, or until a creature not already inside the protected area enters it. When a new creature enters the protected area after the candle was lit, the candle dies out and makes an audible "Hush!" sound.
