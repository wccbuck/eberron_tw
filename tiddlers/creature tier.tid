title: creature tier
tooltip: indicator of how dangerous or powerful a creature is
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A creature's tier is a general indicator of how powerful or dangerous an average specimen is in battle; individuals may rank higher or lower. As a rule of thumb, an individual of a given rank is an even match for three to five individuals of the rank below it. However, even a low-tier creature could have influence far beyond its combat abilities.

Creature tier plays a role in the GM's determination of [[impact]] and [[risk]] for attempts to contend with that creature. See [[Challenge Tiers]] for more information.

* ''Tier 1'' creatures include most "natural" creatures of [[Eberron]], including most [[humanoid]]s and [[beast]]s. (Roughly corresponds to D&D 5e's CR 0-Â½.)
* ''Tier 2'' creatures are extremely dangerous threats to the average non-combatant. This category includes some of the mightiest natural and [[dire beast]]s of the world, including elephants, lions, orca whales, giant scorpions, and [[dinosaur]]s like the [[clawfoot]]. But this category also includes pure [[elemental]]s, [[troll]]s, [[intellect devourer]]s, and most [[ooze]]s. (CR 1-5.)
* ''Tier 3'' creatures can rout a well-trained platoon of soldiers single-handedly. These include the [[medusa]], [[mind flayer]], [[deva]], [[chain devil]], [[wyvern]], [[efreeti]], [[frost giant]], [[treant]], and [[swordtooth titan]]. (CR 6-11.)
* ''Tier 4'' creatures possess power that transcend the wildest possibilities of the natural world. These include the [[vampire]], [[rakshasa]], [[kraken]], adult [[dragon]], [[night hag]], [[planetar]], and [[beholder]]. (CR 12-17.)
* ''Tier 5'' creatures are the stuff of legends. These include the [[solar]], [[balor]], [[elder tempest]], [[kalaraq]], [[inevitable]], [[archfey]], [[daelkyr]], and the oldest living [[dragon]]s. (CR 18-23.)
* ''Tier 6'' entities are godlike archbeings of unfathomable influence. The [[overlord]]s. The [[Architect]]s of [[Irian]]. The [[Dark Power]]s of [[Mabar]]. (CR 24+.)
