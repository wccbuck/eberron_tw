        "text": "The Dragonreach sea stretches between [[Argonnessen]] and\n[[Aerenal]], blending into the [[Thunder Sea]] at the western end\nand the [[Lhazaar Sea]] and the [[Sea of Rage]] in the north. It is a\nfavorite haunt of [[dragon turtle]]s, and water-loving [[dragon]]s\n(particularly [[bronze dragon]]s) frequently swim in its waters.\nMost sailors are reluctant to sail through it as a result, and\nwhen they do, they hug the Aerenal coast.",
