Monstrosities are monsters in the strictest senseâ€”frightening beastlike creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Typically they exhibit properties of one or more natural [[beast]]s. Some are the results of magical energies of [[Lamannia]] or [[Kythri]] (such as [[owlbear]]s) either incidental or through intentional [[magebreeding]], and others are the product of terrible curses (including [[minotaur]]s and [[yuan-ti]]).
