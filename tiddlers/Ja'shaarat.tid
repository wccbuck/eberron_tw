tooltip: ancient Dhakaani city that forms the foundation of Sharn, City of Towers
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Thousands of years before [[human]]s came to [[Khorvaire]], the land belonged to the [[goblinoid]]s. One of the greatest cities of the [[Dhakaani Empire|Dhakaan]] was the
[[hobgoblin]] metropolis of Ja'shaarat (“Bright Blade”), nestled by the edge of the [[Dagger River]]. The early Dhakaani architects carved their city into the stone instead of raising towers above the ground, and the halls of Ja'shaarat extended beneath the surface of the land. The goblin miners pushed into [[Khyber]], discovering a vast lake of fire that burned with a supernatural heat. The blades and armor of the greatest Dhakaani warriors were forged here, and tempered in //khaar'draguus//, the "blood of the dragon". Later, they raised great monolithic buildings that covered each of the plateaus and would later serve as the foundation for the [[City of Towers|Sharn]].

When the alignment of the [[plane]]s brought the [[daelkyr]] and their armies of horrors to [[Eberron]], the [[Dhakaani Empire|Dhakaan]] fell before them, and Ja'shaarat was devastated. The empire never recovered from the conflict and the great city was never restored. The [[goblin]] tribes that hid in the ruins renamed their home ''Duur'shaarat'', “Blade of Sorrows.”

!! Shaarat: Malleon the Reaver

In time, the [[human]]s of [[Sarlona]] began to explore
across the ocean. A wave of humans followed the famed
explorer [[Lhazaar]] to Khorvaire’s eastern shores. They pushed inland and explored the northern and southern coasts seeking land to settle and kingdoms to erect. As a
result, [[Malleon Kas|Malleon the Reaver]] "the Reaver" discovered the inlet of the
[[Dagger River]] twenty-two years after Lhazaar’s historic
undertaking. Malleon enslaved the [[goblinoid]]s and built a
fortress within the ruins on the bluff above the river.

Malleon, a superstitious man, hoped to make peace with whatever spirits remained in the ruins. He sealed off the deeper levels of the goblin-made mountain-monoliths that had been home to the majority of the inhabitants, and he named the city ''Shaarat'', deriving the name from the stories told by his goblin slaves.

!! Dorasharn: Breggor Firstking of Wroat

Over the next three hundred years, Shaarat grew into a powerful and wealthy city. [[Breggor Firstking]], ruler of the pre-[[Galifar]] kingdom of [[Wroat]], demanded that Shaarat bow to his authority. Malleon’s descendants refused. A long siege followed, resulting in the undead Malleon himself rising as a [[wight]] to battle the invaders. The siege ended when Breggor ordered his [[wizard]]s (including his wife, the "Queen of the Burning Sky" [[Raela Solaen]]) to rain destruction on Shaarat. 

Within a decade of the siege of Shaarat, [[Breggor|Breggor Firstking]] began rebuilding the city, renaming it ''Dorasharn''. Towers rose over the next six hundred years, and the city flourished until it was again destroyed in the [[War of the Mark]]. Centuries later, [[Galifar Wynarn]] rebuilt the city once more, naming it [[Sharn]].
