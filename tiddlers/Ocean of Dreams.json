        "text": "A vast expanse of psychic space surrounds [[il-Lashtavar]], home to\nmillions of mortal dreams. The islands in the Ocean of Dreams\nrange from the complex dreamscapes of sentient creatures,\nhumans and dragons alike, to the simple dream of a dog that's\nimagining chasing a ball. From the outside, these islands appear\nas glittering bubbles, each with an image of its dreamer within\nit. They're loosely arranged based on the physical location of\nthe dreamer, so there's a stretch of the ocean that contains\ndreamers near [[Breland]], another for [[Thrane]], and so onâ€”including regions for any dreamers currently on other planes.",
