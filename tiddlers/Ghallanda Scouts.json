The primary focus is on wilderness skills, sharing the house's [[Talentan|Talenta Plains]] heritage with all who wish to learn. It’s also well known for selling cookies, which both helps to raise funds and to hone business skills. Ghallanda Scout programs can be found anywhere where the house has a presence, and all children are welcome to participate; it’s not limited to [[halfling]]s or Ghallanda heirs.",
