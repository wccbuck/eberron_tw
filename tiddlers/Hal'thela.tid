Hal'thela is the [[kar'lassa]] tied to the [[plane]] of [[Thelanis]], on the floor of the [[Thunder Sea]]. The [[sahuagin]] of the [[Eternal Dominion]] shun this dreamer. It is possible this kar'lassa provides a link to a magical undersea [[fey]] realm—the Thelanian [[barony]] of the [[marid]]s, and domain of the Ocean King.

!! Plot Hook: The Quest for Hal'thela

The [[Valraean Protectorate]] is eager to tap the power and the potential of the kar'lassa, and the best candidate is Hal'thela—the kar’lassa bound to Thelanis. But the kar’lassa is deep behind enemy lines. Can the adventurers help find its location and lead a team there? Why do the [[sahuagin]] shun it? Is it simply that they can’t control the capricious [[fey]]? Or is the entire region touched by a fey curse—something that must be lifted before anyone can explore it safely?
