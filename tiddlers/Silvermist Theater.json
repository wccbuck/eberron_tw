        "text": "In the first days of the City, the Silvermist Theatre was the finest theatre in [[Sharn]]. But as the towers rose, the Silvermist was forgotten. The curtains are faded and moth-eaten, and the silver gilt is peeling from its walls. Still, a handful of entertainers have managed to keep the old theater afloat, staging daring performances you won't see anywhere else in Sharn. \n\nOfficially, the Silvermist is a dream\nparlor secretly owned by the [[Boromar Clan]]—a place\nwhere [[illusion]]s and glamers are used for the entertainment of guests. The regular entertainers include\nJix, a [[changeling]]\nwho uses her natural powers to perform unusual\none-woman ballets and operas, and Salleon, a [[gnome]] illusionist who fascinates audiences with bizarre and compelling hypnotic patterns. In addition, the Silvermist is a [[dreamlily]]\nden—a place where people can buy and use dreamlily\nwithout fear of the law. ",
