Also called Ascension Day, this ceremony allows [[Seekers of the Divinity Within|Blood of Vol]] to meditate on their spiritual progress. Seekers gather
for a Sacrament of Blood; once the chalice is filled,
the priest conducts a ritual to purify the blood. The chalice is then passed through the
assembly, and each Seeker takes a sip. The result is
a religious trance during which an imbiber experiences visions and waking dreams; these experiences are said to impart some element of truth or revelation
about the Seekerâ€™s life, faith, or future, but only if the
Seeker interprets the visions properly.
