This ash longbow is stained with a blue oil. If the wielder and target are outside, and skies are cloudy, the wielder can speak the command word and fire a glowing arrow from the bow. A rumbling begins in the sky, and after a few seconds, the target is struck by a bolt of lightning. The wielder must wait at least a minute or so between lightning bolts.
