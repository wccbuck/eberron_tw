A former member of the [[Karrak]] cults in [[Syrkarn]], Ky is one
of the best sources of information on cult activityâ€”she
remains one of the few people to flee their ranks and live
to tell about it. Though she prefers the crowds of [[Ardhmen]] and [[Nderitese]] to the open plains where ambush is
easy, Ky is a loner. She remains a disciple of Karrak,
and the scythe she carries has never seen a wheat field.
Those seeking information on the cults inevitably find
themselves pointed in her direction, but seekers must
spend time and money (mostly at the [[ustah]] taverns) to
win her trust.
