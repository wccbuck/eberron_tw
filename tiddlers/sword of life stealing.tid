title: sword of life stealing
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This sword was sculpted from [[Mabar]]an [[quintessence]], and hungers for the spark of life.

When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and score a [[critical|full success]], that target takes extra necrotic damage if it isn't a [[construct]] or an [[undead]]. You simultaneously rapidly recover from minor injury.
