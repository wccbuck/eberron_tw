This building in [[Krona Peak]] houses the meeting chambers of the [[Iron Council]] of the [[Mror Holds]]. Its utilitarian design gives it a passing resemblance to a titanic lock-box.

The location of Ferrous House continues to be a source of antagonism for rival [[clans|Mror clan]]. The building was constructed on a slope directly below the entrance to
[[Mroranon]]’s estate—traditionally the location where a clan establishes its storehouses and counting rooms. To some, this placement seems symbolic of the [[dwarven|dwarf]] nation being little more than a part of Mroranon’s business interests. Clan leaders dismiss such claims, saying that they raised Ferrous House in its central location to demonstrate the importance of the dwarven confederation.
