They resemble a blend of humanoid and [[tribex]] rather than humanoid and horse. They sport bone\nheadplates and short horns, though these arenâ€™t strong\nenough for an effective gore attack. \n\nThe Trascalando are nomads who usually travel with herds of [[tribex]].\nThough they prefer their isolation and usually have little\ninterest in the world beyond the [[Talenta Plains]], most\nTrascalando bands are friendly toward the Talenta [[halfling]]s and have a long tradition of trade and storytelling. The [[Valenar]] incursions have disrupted this long peace,\nand the Trascalando are deeply suspicious of [[elves|elf]].",
