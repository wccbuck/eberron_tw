The council is an unelected body whose membership changes month to month—any Io’lokari of high enough skill or might is free to join.\n\nCouncil meetings are open to all citizens, but strangers wishing to speak to the council or observe debate are carefully vetted by both interrogation and divination. The [[dragon]]s of the [[Warders]] sometimes observe or offer guidance to the council, with such sessions held on the [[Dragon Green]]. Citizens pack the lawn and line the walls for such special events.",
