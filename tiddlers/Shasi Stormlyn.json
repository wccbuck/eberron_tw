        "text": "The young Prince Shasi Stormlyn Lorghalan has recently claimed the title of Prince of the [[Fleet of Lorghalan]]. Princes of the [[Lorghalan]] fleet have less power among their people than do others among the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], but are recognized as the cleverest on the island, and as such, someone whose voice should always be heard and opinion considered. \n\nPrince Shasi has been urging a dramatic course of action; it's up to the GM just what this is. Does Shasi want to work more closely with [[Ryger|Ryger ir'Wynarn]] to establish a powerful, united [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]]? Does she want to see a new High Prince rise to power? Or does she want the [[Lorghali|Lorghalan]] to shun political change?",
