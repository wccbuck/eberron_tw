        "text": "''Date: '' [[4 Barrakas|Khorvaire calendar]]\n\nWhile followers of [[Balinor]] are taught to live in harmony\nwith nature, this festival celebrates his role as Lord of Horn and Hunt, the hunter who protects his people from marauding predators. Both rural communities and in greatest cities of [[Khorvaire]] observe the Hunt. In [[Sharn]] (and many other metropolises), the\npriests of Balinor arrange to have a dangerous beast transported to the city and released into an isolated section of [[Old Sharn]]. Anyone who wishes can participate in the Hunt by making a donation of 1 crown. Hunters receive the blessing of Balinor, and enter the depths to track down the beast. The hunter (or group) who brings down the beast\nwins a prize of [[50c|money]], fame throughout the city, and the blessing of Balinor.\n\nWhile the quarry of the Hunt is generally\nreferred to as “the beast,” over the years the Hunt\nhas taken different forms. In some years, multiple beasts are released, and the\nhunter who catches the most of them is the victor. During the [[Last War]],\nrumors persist that a city in [[Karrnath]] used prisoners of war as the quarry in the Hunt. \n\nIn any case, it often turns out that the other competitors are a greater threat to hunters than the beasts they stalk.",
