//"The executioners tried everything. He was bathed in acid, burned at the stake, drowned, even dismembered. And after each attempt, he rose again, his vigor unchecked and flesh rebound. No lesser mage could set his will over the flesh of Mordain."//

Mordain the Fleshweaver, one of the most powerful [[wizard]]s in history and the subject of dark fireside tales, lives in exile in western [[Droaam]]. Though the [[Twelve]]
have attempted to imprison Mordain for his disturbing attempts
to master the magic of the [[daelkyr]], few have the
power to directly oppose him.

!! Lore of the Fleshweaver

Near [[Droaam]]’s border with the
[[Shadow Marches]], [[Mordain's Hall]] reaches into the
sky like a massive malformed arm. The [[area|Forest of Flesh]] that
surrounds it is filled with foul [[skinweaver]]s and other horrors of Mordain’s own creation. His servants search constantly for ancient [[daelkyr]] sites within Droaam
and the Shadow Marches, and some say that the mad
mage hopes to reopen the gates to [[Xoriat]].

More than two centuries ago, Mordain d’[[Phiarlan]] was one of the [[Twelve]], but the
ambitious mage began delving into forbidden lore,
choosing to experiment with the magic of the daelkyr. Though he was captured, tried, and found guilty of capital offenses, the mages could not find a way to execute the aberrant wizard. He was then petrified and sent to [[Dreadhold]], but escaped before reaching the island prison.
