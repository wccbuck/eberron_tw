        "text": "The Castalaloa, or \"Those Who Prefer to Walk Between,\" are a [[halfling]] tribe who dwell among the sheer cliffs of the southwestern [[Ironroot Mountains]]. The tribe consists mostly of [[stout]] halflings, but also includes some [[dwarves|dwarf]], [[gnome]]s, and [[orc]]s. Climbers of legendary skill, the Castalaloa dwell in caves high on the cliff faces, and are renowned breeders of [[glidewing]]s, which they ride to fly about their domain. They often trade with the nomadic Talenta tribes of the plains below, but over the centuries, the Castalaloa have also formed close ties with the [[Mror|Mror Holds]] clans (primarily [[Soldorak]] and, until 400 years ago, [[Noldrun|Noldrunhold]]), as well as the [[Jhorash'tar]] [[orc]]s. While their culture is grounded in Talenta traditions, they have incorporated many elements from both the Mror and the Jhorash'tar. In fact, some Castalaloa even make use of [[Soldorak]]-bred [[symbiont]]s.",
