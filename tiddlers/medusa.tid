!! Overview

The [[Gatekeepers]] claim that medusas were created by the [[daelkyr]] [[Orlassk]], but the medusa priests of [[Cazhaak Draal]] offer their devotions to the [[Shadow]]. They claim that the Shadow shaped many of the creatures [[human]]s see as monsters, giving the [[harpy]] her deadly voice, hiding the [[displacer beast]] from its foes, and healing the wounds of the [[troll]]. These priests view the deities of the [[Sovereign Host]] as the true evil, comparing the exile of the Shadow to the fear with which many humans respond to medusas and other monsters.

There are relatively few medusas in [[Droaam]], but
their intelligence and mystical power makes them a vital part
of this growing nation. Medusa [[stoneshaper]] architects direct construction
in the blended cities, laying the foundations of what this nation
could become. Medusas who choose to serve as [[Katra's Voice]]
are often called upon to resolve disputes and enforce justice,
for who dares challenge the ruling of a medusa? Cazhaak Draal is also the seat of the most organized religious tradition in Droaam—the worship of the [[Dark Six]] known as the [[Cazhaak Creed]]—and most powerful priests of the Six are medusas. Compared to many denizens of
the region, medusas tend to be calm and rational; however, they
expect to be treated with respect and aren't above a few harsh
lessons to make a point.

The gaze of a medusa can [[petrify|flesh to stone]] even an ally, and as a result, a medusa does not meet the gaze of a person with whom it is conversing. Where she directs her eyes indicates her esteem for the person. She drops her eyes toward the ground to show respect, or looks up and over the person if she wishes to indicate disdain; when speaking to an equal, she glances to the left or right. If she wishes to show trust, she directs her gaze to the person, but closes her eyes.

A medusa's gaze is a powerful weapon, but most medusas don't think of it as deadly. A petrified victim can be restored to life, after all; within their own society, medusas often use petrification as a way to preserve mortally wounded kin, so they can be restored at a later time when healing magic is available. Likewise, medusas dying of old age often choose to be petrified before they fully pass on; [[Cazhaak Draal]] contains a great catacomb filled with the stone remnants of respected medusa elders. This ties to the love of stonework common in the culture; when a medusa looks at a statue, she sees the life it represents.

Speaking of old age, [[Cazhaak|Cazhaak Draal]] medusas can live up to 250 years; they rarely show the effects of aging until the very end. Also, most Cazhaak medusas are female, but roughly one in five are male.

A medusa uses its living mane for many purposes. In addition to serving as weapons and a supplemental form of eyesight, a medusa's serpents also help her communicate. The motions of the serpents often reflect a medusa's mood, and a GM should consider the state of a medusa's mane when describing her actions. The medusas of [[Cazhaak Draal]] have developed a simple [[language]] called ''Serpentine'', which is based on the motions and hissing of their snakes.

!! History of the Medusas

The [[Cazhaak Creed]] asserts that the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]] created and cultivated weak creatures that they could dominate—pathetic, powerless creatures, like [[human]]s. It was the [[Shadow]] who gave the blessed creatures—those humans call “monsters”—their gifts. The oldest medusa myths maintain that their ancestors were slaves in the depths of [[Khyber]] in a realm of stone, enslaved by a “stone tyrant,” where they were forced to carve strange monuments and mazes, to labor endlessly in mines, to raise towers only to destroy them and start again. The [[Shadow]] recognized their potential and ambition and gave them the power to break their chains. These myths were passed down through oral tradition for centuries before they were codified. 

[[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]] [[druid]]s and many modern scholars assert that [[Orlassk]] was most likely the "Stone Tyrant" who actually created the medusas a little over a thousand years ago, blending [[human]] explorers or colonists with [[basilisk]]s. But medusas of [[Cazhaak Draal]] would say that even if Orlassk were their creator, it was simply a pawn guided by the [[Shadow]], and that it was the Shadow who gave their ancestors the strength to rebel against the Stone Tyrant. 

The medusas have never been a widespread or numerous people. Their myths speak of a long period of nomadic wandering following their escape from the Stone Tyrant, and describe periods of settlement in what seem to be different [[demiplane]]s—periods that always end in disaster, with the medusas being forced to move on. This exodus came to an end when they settled in a [[Dhakaan]]i city deep below the surface, a vault whose keepers were slain long ago. The medusas call this city //Niaanu Draal//, the Mother City, and it was here that they wrote down their myths and established the traditions they carry on today. They remained in Niaanu Draal for over two centuries, before this, too, ended in tragedy. The forces of a [[daelkyr]] drove the medusas from Niaanu Draal. These enemies could not (or would not) follow the medusas to the surface, and so they came to [[Cazhaak Draal]] and claimed it as their home.

Which [[daelkyr]] did they fight? It’s possible that it was [[Orlassk]], that the minions of the Stone Tyrant sought to reclaim its former subjects. It could be that [[Belashyrra]] was offended by these creatures with their deadly gaze, or that the crawling hordes of [[Valaara]] overran the Mother City. This battle took place centuries ago, and ultimately it is up to the GM to decide the specifics. Given the enigmatic nature of the daelkyr, it’s entirely possible that the medusas' exodus to the surface was the daelkyr’s goal all along.

!! Whispers in the Stone

Whether their gifts flow from the [[Shadow]] or from the [[daelkyr]], medusas have an affinity for stone and for other creatures that possess the power of petrification. This isn’t a [[primal|primal magic]] bond like that of a [[druid]] or a [[Lorghalan]] [[gnome]]; it’s in many ways a deeply //unnatural// connection; for a medusa, the line between flesh and stone is flexible. Many medusas say that they can hear stone whispering in their sleep; others say that stone sings a song. Medusas with an especially strong affinity for stone can master a number of supernatural powers, from being able to [[mold|mold earth]] and [[shape stone|stone shape]] to locating veins of minerals and ore by listening for their songs. 

As a medusa, consider your relationship to the stone. If you’re playing a character with spells related to stone, you could tie these to this gift; a [[ranger]] with a spell like [[entangle]] could be causing tendrils of stone to rise up from the earth rather than plants. Even if you don’t have any magic, consider that statues and walls may be whispering to you; what do they have to say? 

!! Medusa Names

[[Cazhaak|Cazhaak Draal]] medusas typically use a single name, usually two or more syllables with a sibilant sound. This is accompanied by additional elements in Serpentine—hissing and a particular shaping of the serpent mane—that other creatures can’t reproduce, so there’s an additional layer of complexity that typically goes unappreciated.
