        "text": "The captain of [[Argonth]] is a veteran who has served [[Breland]] for three decades. Alain ir’Ranek is a true hero of Breland and is proud to command this symbol of its power. King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] appointed ir’Ranek the [[Viscount|Nobility of the Five Nations]] of [[Argonth]], asserting that the fortress is its own domain; as such, ir’Ranek and his troops aren’t subject to Count [[ir'Blis|Thavius ir'Blis]], and the Marshal has the power to enforce Brelish law over civilians in addition to maintaining military discipline within his crew. \n\nAlain ir’Ranek is in his fifties and prefers to avoid physical confrontations, but he’s a clever strategist, a charismatic leader, and an honorable man—all things that differentiate him from Lord [[Veirner ir'Tajar]] of [[Orcbone]]. With that said, ir’Ranek has only been on the frontier for a few months, and he doesn’t yet know the community leaders or the ins and outs of how things are done here.",
