This glowing morningstar casts bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for additional 20 feet while you hold it. Targets hit by this weapon suffer additional radiant damage. In addition, you can cast the spell [[daylight]] from this weapon. Once the weapon has been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the following dawn.
