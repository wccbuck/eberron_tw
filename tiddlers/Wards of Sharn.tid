!! Summary

[[Sharn]] is a vertical city, and elevation is an indicator of
status and wealth. Each quarter is roughly divided into
three levels, and the combination of quarter and level
defines a ward. Thus, wards have names such as [[Lower Dura]], [[Upper Central]], and [[Middle Menthis]].

[[Upper wards|upper ward]] are the domain of the rich and powerful. Here you'll find the finest goods and the most expensive services. Only those who maintain a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle can easily afford the prices for meals and lodging, and adventurers who maintain a squalid or wretched lifestyle might be treated with disdain.

Violence is rare in any of the upper wards, and the
[[Sharn Watch]] actively patrols these areas. Although
the guards here might be corrupt just as in a middle or
lower ward, they're already being well paid by powerful
nobles and criminal organizations, and they work efficiently in the service of these forces.

[[Middle wards|middle ward]] are home to the middle classes. Here
you'll find bustling markets and taverns, along with a
wide range of entertainment and housing. Most goods
and services are affordable by those of a modest or
comfortable lifestyle, with a few higher-priced options
tucked away. The Sharn Watch has a presence, but not
as strong as in the upper wards.

[[Lower wards|lower ward]] house the hard-working laborers, along
with the destitute and the desperate, including refugees
who lost everything in the war and orphans who never
had anything to begin with. Services priced for a modest lifestyle can be found, but overall the lower wards are
home to those who have no better than a poor lifestyle;
a visitor who displays signs of a wealthy or aristocratic
lifestyle might attract unwanted attention. The watch
pays little attention to the lower districts, making them a
haven for criminals and gangs.

These are stereotypes that don't apply to all wards.
[[Dura]] is a particularly poor quarter, meaning that [[Upper Dura]] is effectively a middle ward in economic terms;
similarly, because [[Central Plateau]] is a hub of wealth
and power, [[Lower Central]] is effectively a middle ward.

Each ward is further subdivided into districts, which
are neighborhoods defined by an economic role, a separate culture, or both. For example, [[Lower Northedge]]
includes the districts of [[Stoneyard]], [[Longstairs]], and
[[North Market]]. It's generally true that the combination of
a district's ward and quarter will give you a broad idea
of what to expect there. A district in [[Upper Central]] will
typically be well kept and swarming with guards, while
a district in [[Lower Dura]] will be squalid and dangerous. 

See <<scrollToHeader "Important Districts">> below for more detail.

!! Getting Around

Sharn is an enormous city, and traveling on foot from
one side of the city to the other can be time-consuming; see the <<scrollToHeader "Travel Time">> section below. In addition, not all the quarters of Sharn are linked to one another by
bridges. The connections that do exist include these:

* [[Central Plateau]] has bridges that lead to [[Northedge]] and [[Menthis|Menthis Plateau]].
* [[Dura]] is connected to [[Tavick's Landing]] and Menthis.
* Tavick's Landing is connected to Dura, Menthis, and [[Northedge]]. 
* Menthis is connected to Tavick's Landing, Dura, and Central.
* Northedge is connected to Central and Tavick's Landing.

Check the <$wikify name=locations text="{{Dura!!polygons}} {{Tavick's Landing!!polygons}}"><$button class="tc-btn-invisible tc-tiddlylink"><$action-setfield $tiddler="$:/FlyLocation" text=<<locations>> fly="yes"/><$action-setfield $tiddler="$:/state/tab/sidebar--595412856" text="$:/Map"/><$mapscrollintoview/>Map</$button></$wikify> or individual district pages to confirm whether a direct walking path exists between two districts.

Traveling from district to district involves the use of
bridges and ramps, along with magic lifts—vast floating
disks that slowly ascend and descend along threads of
mystical energy. Lifts are mainly used to move cargo
and can be up to 30 feet in diameter. Most lifts have rails
but aren't fully enclosed; if combatants fight on a lift,
someone falling or being pushed off the edge is always a
possibility.

!!! Travel Time

For a walking travel time guideline, use the following: 30 minutes per district, including ones connected by bridge; but only 10 minutes for going up or down a level. Factors like traffic or lift wait times can impact this estimate.

<<<

Example: [[Clifftop]] to [[Deathsgate]]. 

''Path 1:'' [[Clifftop]] →(30m)→ [[Hope's Peak]] →(30m)→ [[Redstone]] →(30m)→ [[Daggerwatch]] →(30m)→ [[Highhold]] →(30m)→ [[Sunrise]] →(30m)→ [[Ocean View]] →(30m)→ [[Dalan's Refuge]] →(down, 10m)→ [[Deathsgate]] (''220 minutes'')

''Path 2:'' [[Clifftop]] →(30m)→ [[Hope's Peak]] →(30m)→ [[Redstone]] →(30m)→ [[Daggerwatch]] →(bridge, 30m)→ [[Ivy Towers]] →(30m)→ [[University District]] →(30m)→ [[Platinate]] →(bridge, 30m)→ [[Dalan's Refuge]] →(down, 10m)→ [[Deathsgate]] (''220 minutes'')

For a speedier journey through the streets, House [[Orien]] manages a system of carriages for hire, which can hold four people (not including the driver). Taking an Orien carriage cuts travel time by half, and costs a small fee ([[0.05c|money]] per district, rounded to the nearest crown). So a carriage journey from [[Clifftop]] to [[Deathsgate]] would take 110 minutes. The cost is less than half a crown for this cross-city journey, so it's considered negligible; only long round-trips and back-and-forth journeys across [[Sharn]] should begin to cost money worth tracking. 

Smaller, one-person carriages and rickshaws are half the price, an amount which almost always rounds to zero crowns for mechanical purposes.

''Flight'' is, of course, the fastest way to get around in Sharn, cutting travel time down to one-fifth of the walking pace (6 minutes per district). In addition, districts that are adjacent but not connected by bridges (such as [[Clifftop]] and [[Shae Lias]], or the [[Bazaar]] and [[Dava Gate]]) can be considered connected when flying. 

The most common form of aerial transport is the [[skycoach]]. Four-person skycoaches typically cost [[0.2c|money]] per district (rounded to the nearest crown). Thus, a [[skycoach]] journey from [[Clifftop]] to [[Deathsgate]] would cost 2c and take about 44 minutes. (Flying offers no shortcut in this case; cutting straight from [[Dura]] to [[Central Plateau]] still requires travelers to pass through eight districts.)

Some companies, such as [[Silverstreak|Silverstreak Skycoach Rental Company]], even let groups rent four-person skycoaches for extended periods (along with a qualified driver); this service costs 3c per hour.

One-person flying options are only 0.1c per district. Options include rowboat-sized [[skycoaches|skycoach]], but many flying mounts, including [[hippogriff]]s, [[griffon]]s, [[glidewing]]s, and [[giant owl]]s, can also be found for hire around the city. 

In summary:

|!Travel Option |!Travel Time Per District |!Cost Per District |
|Foot |20 minutes |Free |
|One-person carriage |10 minutes |Free* |
|Four-person carriage |10 minutes |0.05c |
|One-person flying transport |5 minutes† |0.1c |
|Four-person flying transport |5 minutes† |0.2c |
<br/>*: Actually 0.025c per district, but this is usually negligible<br/>
†: Or faster, with flying shortcuts

!! Dungeons of Sharn

[[Sharn]] boasts countless opportunities for adventurers.
You can get caught up in espionage in [[Upper Central]] or
drawn into a crime war in [[Lower Dura]]. Aside from the
intrigues and politics of the city, Sharn has a wide range
of cursed ruins, haunted slums, shunned catacombs,
and other dangerous places. Wise folk avoid these areas, but those whose hunger for adventure outweighs their good sense might do the opposite.
