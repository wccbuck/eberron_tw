Most ambitious members of House [[Deneith]] spend a year or two serving as soldiers in the Blademarks Guild. The guild has fewer soldiers than it did five years ago, to be sure, but those blademarks under contract are as busy as ever. The end of the war just meant that the blademarks were available to be hired by entities other than armies in the field, such as other [[dragonmarked house]]s, local nobles, and countries beyond the [[Five Nations]].\n\nOne noteworthy troop of the Blademarks Guild is the ''League of the Bitter Blade''. This mercenary band is composed of soldiers who served in the Queenâ€™s Guard of [[Cyre]] and are now left with no war to fight and no kingdom to return to.\n\nThe Lord Commander of the Blademarks is [[Shirin d'Deneith]].",
