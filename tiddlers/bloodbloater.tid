A bloodbloater is a flat, disk-shaped, aquatic ooze about 8 inches in diameter with a bulge at the center. It is milky white with flecks of red. When it is in water, a bloodbloater has [[blindsight]] out to 60 feet and can swim up to 3.5 mph; on land, its blindsight range drops to 10 feet, and it can only travel 0.5 mph.

Individually, a bloodbloater poses little threat. However, these oozes congregate of swarms of hundreds of creatures, at which point they can be a dire threat to unwary swimmers. When a bloodbloater latches onto a creature, it begins to drain the target's blood, and often will not stop even after it has turned crimson, completely suffused with blood and sweating excess into the surrounding water. A large enough swarm of bloodbloaters can drain a person to death in a matter of minutes.
