The streets are full of wagons and\nlaborers hauling goods to and from the skydocks\nof [[Precarious]].<br/>\n''Social Class:'' Lower class<br/>\n''Neighbors:'' [[Callestan]] (northeast); [[Precarious]] (northwest); [[Fallen]] (south); [[Forgelight Towers]] (bridge, southeast); [[Ship's Towers]]/[[Sharn's Welcome]] (below and west); [[Stormhold]] (above); \n\nThe Stores district has much in common with [[Precarious]]. However, the Stores is not actually built on\nthe cliff side, and the [[Watch|Sharn Watch]] focuses its attention\nand resources on Precarious. The result is that the\nStores are slightly more dangerous than Precarious,\nand smugglers are more likely to hide their goods\nin these warehouses. The [[Boromar Clan]] has strong\ninterests in this district, and thus a considerable\n[[halfling]] population can be found here. ",
