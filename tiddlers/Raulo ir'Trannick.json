        "text": "Raulo ir’Trannick is the lord mayor of [[Arcanix]] and a member of the [[Arcane Congress]]. His family has long had holdings on the southeastern banks of [[Lake Galifar]], and his position as\nTrannick patriarch demands he live earthbound and\nboard a [[hippogriff]] when he’s needed for the business of\nthe Congress. Raulo and other members of the Trannick family are the proctors of the Autumn Entrance Exams, determining which of [[Aundair]]’s brightest will get a chance to become [[wizard]]s or [[artificer]]s.\nRaulo also serves as a de facto ambassador between\nthe [[Arcane Congress]] and any wizards who arrive at\n[[Arcanix]] unannounced.\n\nThe Trannick family offers trained [[hippogriff]]s that can ascend to the floating towers for visitors unable to get there under their own power. The Trannicks collect a modest transit fee, which they use to fund scholarships for deserving\nyoung mages.",
