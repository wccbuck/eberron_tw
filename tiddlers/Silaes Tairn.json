They are seen by the [[Valaes Tairn]] and the [[Aereni]] as extremists, since Xen'drik is now a cursed ruin, and the modern-day [[giant]]s and [[drow]] are a far cry from the ancient foes of the [[Age of Giants]].\n\nThe Silaes Tairn's single army has twenty-one warclans, most of which remain in [[Aerenal]], but at any given time there are four Silaes warclans active\nin [[Xen'drik]]. The [[giant]]s of Xen’drik are no longer the\nmighty enemies their ancestors fought, but Silaes\nwarriors pit their skills against the deadliest threats\nXen’drik has to offer, and search for artifacts and\nrelics of their [[patron ancestor]]s.",
