Hezrous serve as foot soldiers in the demonic hordes of the [[Legion|legion of Shavarath]] of [[Cruelty]]. Although physically powerful and armed with sharp teeth and claws, they are weak-minded, and hezrous can easily be duped into sacrificing themselves by more powerful [[demon]]s. As they press their attacks into the heart of an enemy's forces, their foul stench can sicken even the toughest foes.
