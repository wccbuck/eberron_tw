Farmers tend the fields, while tribes of shifters\nand circles of [[druid]]s and rangers roam through the\nwoods. These are the Eldeen Reaches.\n\nDruids and [[shifter]]s dwelled in the [[Towering Wood]]\nfor thousands of years, but the eastern farmlands of the\nReaches were part of [[Aundair]] until the [[Last War]]. The\nlords of Aundair focused their resources on the war effort, ignoring banditry and other problems faced by the\nfarmers of the east. The [[Wardens of the Wood]]—largest\nof the [[druid]] sects—came to the aid of these farmers.\nFifty years ago, the people of eastern Aundair seceded\nand formed the Eldeen Reaches. The [[Treaty of Thronehold]] recognized the Reaches as a nation, but its citizens fear Aundair will try to reclaim the region.\n\n[[Druidic magic|primal magic]] is central to life in the Eldeen Reaches.\nIts people seek to live in harmony with the natural\nworld, and each community has a druidic advisor and perhaps a [[gleaner]] or two who help with planning and planting. The Towering Wood is also home to tribes of [[shifter]]s, who maintain a nomadic existence. The [[Wardens of the Wood]] uphold\norder and settle disputes, and the Great Druid [[Oalian]]—an [[awaken]]ed greatpine—is the spiritual leader of the Reaches.\n\n!! Interesting Things About the Eldeen Reaches\n\n* The [[Towering Wood]] is vast and untamed. The [[Wardens of the Wood]] seek to protect travelers, but swathes of forest remain entirely untouched by [[human]] or [[shifter]]. Such areas could hold giant beasts never seen in the outside world, or relics from a previous age—artifacts or ruins created by [[demon]]s or the terrifying [[daelkyr]].\n* The [[fey]] have a strong presence in the Towering Wood. Even outside the fey stronghold of the [[Twilight Demesne]], [[manifest zone]]s tied to [[Thelanis]] allow passage between worlds. The Eldeen Reaches are a logical origin for a character with ties to the fey.\n* [[Druidic|druid]] magic is a vital tool in the Eldeen Reaches. Resident [[gleaner]]s use [[animal messenger]]s to carry communications between villages, and [[beast]]s perform vital services. [[Goodberry|goodberry]] wine takes the place of House [[Vadalis]] healing. Communities include [[awaken]]ed animals and plants as members. \n\n!! Eldeen Characters\n\nWhen creating an Eldeen character or NPC, consider\nthe following:\n\n* ''Farm or Forest?'' Did you grow up on one of the farms of the eastern Reaches, or did you spend your childhood in the Towering Wood? Are you comfortable in buildings, or do you prefer the open air? As a child of the forest, you might take the [[Outlander]] talent, or perhaps you might take [[Bodyguard]], as you put yourself at ris defending farmers from bandits and beasts.\n* ''Natural Magic.'' Druidic traditions play an important role in Eldeen society. If you're a [[druid]] or ranger, are you a stoic [[Warden of the Wood|Wardens of the Wood]] or a grim [[Child of Winter|Children of Winter]]? Even if you're not a full spellcaster, you might take a few [[primal magic]] [[spell]]s to reflect a basic initiation into the druidic mysteries.\n* ''A Land with No Lords.'' The Reachers are fiercely independent. They broke with [[Aundair]], and they bow to no monarch. The folk of the Reaches value talent over titles. The Eldeen people respect the guidance of the [[druid]]s, but they all work together to solve their problems; no one gives orders to a Reacher. \n\n!! Cities and Sites\n\nMost people of the Eldeen Reaches live in villages and\non farms. Some folk in the Towering Wood make their\nhomes in the vast trees, while others are wanderers. \n\n!!! Cities\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[location]tag[city]sort[title]]\">>\n\n!!! Towns\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[location]tag[town]sort[title]]:filter[get[text]length[]compare:integer:gt[350]]\">>\n\n!!! Other Sites\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[location]!tag[province]!tag[city]!tag[town]sort[title]]:filter[get[text]length[]compare:integer:gt[350]]\">>\n\n!! Aftermath of the Last War\n\nThe farmers of the eastern Eldeen seceded from [[Aundair]] during the [[Last War]], and tensions between the two\nnations remain high. Most Reachers believe it's only a\nmatter of time until Aundair tries to reclaim the region,\nand every village has a militia ready to serve.\n\nThe people of the Reaches value hospitality and regard all people as equals, but the fear of Aundairian\naggression can cause Reachers to treat foreigners with\nsuspicion or hostility.
