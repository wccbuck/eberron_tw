        "text": "Ran Iishiv, the Unmaker, is an [[overlord]] imprisoned within the mountain of [[Telathal]] in [[Adar]], [[Sarlona]]. It is a force of unmitigated chaos and destruction, and may be the most powerful of all overlords. Some believe that Ran Iishiv reflects [[Khyber]]’s primal hatred of creation itself, the burning desire to tear down the Material Plane and start anew. Its anger at being bound during the [[Age of Demons]] created the great volcanic core of the mountain. \n\nA secret known only to the [[Storm Guardians]], the [[dragon]]s who defend Telathal—Ran Iishiv's fury is what fuels the supernatural storms that protect [[Adar]]. Its violent passion is channeled through the [[Teeth of the Three]] and causes hurricanes and thunderstorms to erupt wherever great violence is committed in the land of refuge. The [[wild zone]]s within [[Adar]] and perhaps all of [[Sarlona]] may also be due to the Unmaker's influence, where it has torn away the [[Ethereal Veil]] which normally serves as a buffer between the [[plane]]s and Eberron.\n\nRan Iishiv has no allies among the [[Lords of Dust]]; in fact, [[fiend]]s tied to other [[overlord]]s may help prevent its release. Its primary servants are the [[Endseekers]], cultists who have heard the Unmaker's somniloquies, and seek to return reality to primordial chaos.\n\n!! Overlord... or Something Older?\n\nBefore the [[Progenitor Dragons]] formed the [[plane]]s, the [[Sun]], and reality as we know it, what already existed in the primordial chaos? Were there powers that resisted the Progenitors' efforts, and seek to unmake reality and restore the primeval silence even to this day?\n\nIf so, a GM might create an interesting twist on Ran Iishiv the Unmaker: Perhaps it was //incorrectly classified// as an [[overlord]] due to its malefic and immortal nature, thought to be one of the powerful first children of [[Khyber]]—but in truth, it predates the creation of the planes themselves.
