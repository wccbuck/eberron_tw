        "text": "Ran Iishiv, the Unmaker, is an [[overlord]] imprisoned within the mountain of [[Telathal]] in [[Adar]], [[Sarlona]]. It is a force of unmitigated chaos and destruction, and may be the most powerful of all overlords. Some believe that Ran Iishiv reflects [[Khyber]]’s primal hatred of creation itself, the burning desire to tear down the Material Plane and start anew. Its anger at being bound during the [[Age of Demons]] created the great volcanic core of the mountain. \n\nA secret known only to the [[Storm Guardians]], the [[dragon]]s who defend Telathal—Ran Iishiv's fury is what fuels the supernatural storms that protect [[Adar]]. Its violent passion is channeled through the [[Teeth of the Three]] and causes hurricanes and thunderstorms to erupt wherever great violence is committed in the land of refuge. The [[wild zone]]s within [[Adar]] and perhaps all of [[Sarlona]] may also be due to the Unmaker's influence, where it has torn away the [[Ethereal Veil]] which normally serves as a buffer between the [[plane]]s and Eberron.\n\nRan Iishiv has no allies among the [[Lords of Dust]]; in fact, [[fiend]]s tied to other [[overlord]]s may help prevent its release. Its primary servants are the [[Endseekers]], cultists who have heard the Unmaker's somniloquies, and seek to return reality to primordial chaos.",
