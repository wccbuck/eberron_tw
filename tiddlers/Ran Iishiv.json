Its anger at being bound during the [[Age of Demons]] created the great volcanic core of the mountain. \n\nA secret known only to the [[Storm Guardians]], the [[dragon]]s who defend Korrandarâ€”Ran Iishiv's fury is what fuels the supernatural storms that protect [[Adar]]. Its violent passion is channelled through the [[Teeth of the Three]] and causes hurricanes and thunderstorms to erupt wherever great violence is committed in the land of refuge.",
