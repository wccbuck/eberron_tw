''Sovereign:'' [[Dol Arrah]]

As [[Siberys]] fought [[Khyber]], a [[dragon]] who follows the [[Sovereign archetype]] of the lightkeeper stands against Khyberâ€™s offspring and other forces that threaten [[Eberron]]. Lightkeepers enforce order within [[Argonnessen]], and fight the cults of the [[Daughter of Khyber|Tiamat]] that emerge there. Guardians who watch over the resting places of [[fiend]]s often follow this path. Lightkeepers tend to place great value on personal honor and sacrifice.

While lightkeepers generally avoid interfering with the younger species, a few are hidden among [[humanoid]]s, including a few agents of the [[Chamber]].
