''Sovereign:'' [[Dol Arrah]]

As [[Siberys]] fought [[Khyber]], the lightkeeper stands against Khyberâ€™s offspring and other forces that threaten [[Eberron]]. Guardians who watch over the resting places of [[fiend]]s often follow this path. Lightkeepers place great value on personal honor and sacrifice.
