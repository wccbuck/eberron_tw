Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within 1 mile. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose suffers extreme [[fire and force damage|damage type]] from the explosion. The sphere spreads around corners, and causes uncontrollable destruction.
