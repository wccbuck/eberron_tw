''Prerequisite:'' Can cast the [[borrowed knowledge]] spell

I was in [[Metrol]] on the Day of [[Mourning]]. Now
I’m bound to the spirits of those who died.
When I sleep, I dream their lost dreams. When I
wake, a dead person’s memories accompany my
own—along with the knowledge of something
they want me to do. Sometimes it’s trivial: sing
a song, eat their favorite meal. Other requests
are more intense. If I ignore them, I’m wracked
with restless nightmares, which persist until I
do my best to fulfill the spirit’s desire.

//Do I wish to be freed from this, or do I consider it a blessing?//

''GM Notes: ''The character is haunted by a different [[ghost]]s day after day. The spirit provides them with the [[borrowed knowledge]] spell (as well as other random tidbits of information from past lives; maybe one day, the character can speak [[Talentan]], but the fluency is gone the next day), but it also makes a particular
request of them—the table below provides possibilities, but you can
also make up requests that help drive the story
of the adventure.

If the character completely ignores a request,
they could suffer nightmares and be denied
the benefits of their next sleep, but as
long as they at least try to fulfill the request,
they should be fine. While this is primarily an
opportunity for roleplaying, it could turn out
that there’s much greater significance to this.
Does the character hold the spirit of Queen [[Dannel|Dannel ir'Wynarn]] of [[Cyre]]? Are they keeping these spirits
from dissolving in [[Dolurrh]]? Does this mean
that the spirits could be raised from the dead,
even though it would otherwise be too late for
that? Could [[Lady Illmarrow]] use this trove of
[[ghost]]s for some evil purpose? The full potential
of this secret is up to you.
