type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The aged Nalyna led the [[Union of the Shield]] for half his life before retiring to write a definitive encyclopedia of combat styles. He is greatly interested in meeting characters who have exotic combat-oriented training, and such PCs can usually lodge in his palatial [[Terrace]] apartments for as long as they are in the city. To those he judges trustworthy, Nalyna confides a deep secretâ€”his plan to create a covert army of
[[dragon]]slayers within the city. He has seen too many near attacks from the [[Vast]] over the years, and believes that the [[Io'lokari]] must take the fight to the [[rogues|rogue dragon]] before it is too late.
