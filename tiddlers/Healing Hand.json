The [[Unity]]'s skilled healers largely employ non-magical methods, but powerful [[psionic|psionics]] healing can be found in the [[bastion cities|bastion city]], as well as powerful tools such as the [[cradle of healing]].\n\nAlthough the Healing Hand is generally benevolent,\nit has its darker side. Euthanasia is perfectly acceptable in\nRiedran society, and the needs of the nation always come\nbefore those of the individual. If someone who has a genetic\ncondition, a grievous injury, or a serious contagious [[disease]]\ncannot be easily cured, he is killed. The Healing Hand also\ndisposes of the dead, typically through cremation.\n\nLady [[Xushila]] leads the Healing Hand from the bastion of [[Dar Ilash]].\n\n!! The Healing Hand In Dar Jin\n\nThe Healing Hand maintains a large infirmary in the [[Jhodra]] of [[Dar Jin]] that provides mundane healing to those in need. In addition, the [[Chosen]] overseer [[Taan]] can perform [[psionic|psionics]] healing. He usually reserves this power for [[Riedrans]] in need, but could help foreigners who have somehow earned his respect.",
