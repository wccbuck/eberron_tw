        "text": "The Alazerth Elemon is a senior monk of the monastery vessel known as [[Zertherun IV]] floating in the [[Sea of Chaos]] in [[Kythri]]. He is charged with dealing with outsiders, which is sometimes a matter of diplomatic negotiations, and other times, rallying zerths (monks who exemplify the teachings of Zerthimon, the hero who led their exodus) to defend the vessel from attack. Like most [[githzerai|gith]], Elemon isn't inherently hostile toward outsiders, but has no great love for them; his reaction is based entirely on the actions and approach of the visitors.",
