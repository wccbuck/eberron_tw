title: giantkiller sling
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This wicked sling is devastating against foes larger than yourself. When you hit a creature with a projectile launched from this sling, gain +1 [[impact]] if the creature is 5 or more times massive than you are, or +2 [[impact]] if the creature is 20 or more times more massive than you are. Striking a larger creature in this way has a chance to knock the creature back or cause them to fall prone.
