Count ir'Omik is also cousin to King [[Kaius|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]].\n\nAfter the signing of the [[Treaty of Thronehold]] that ended the [[Last War]], King [[Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] of [[Karrnath]] withdrew [[undead soldiers|Karrnathi undead]] from his active legions as a gesture of good will in securing the peace. But undead and the business of making them remain central to [[Karrnath]]â€™s military strength. Kaius commanded\nthe [[Ministry of the Dead]] to maintain operations and readiness should hostilities\nresume, but to keep a low profile. The count follows these orders to the letter, creating and equipping large numbers of [[undead]] soldiers in highly secretive operations in [[Fort Zombie]] and [[Fort Bones]]. The people of [[Vedykar]] and [[Vulyar]] have learned not to ask too many questions about where the bodies of their dead are taken.\n\nCount ir'Omik is a skilled [[necromancer|necromancy]] and is fascinated with [[undeath|undead]]. Unbeknownst to the King, he has recently directed the [[Kind]] of the [[Corpse Collectors]] to develop new experimental types of [[Karrnathi undead]] by collecting bodies from specific bloodlines, and to \"field test\" these new creations beyond [[Karrnath]]'s borders. The [[elves|elf]] of [[Valenar]] have clashed with [[ghoul]]s and [[vampire spawn|vampire]] in the [[Talenta Plains]]; they naturally suspect Karrnath, but don't have proof.",
