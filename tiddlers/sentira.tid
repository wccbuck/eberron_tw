type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Sentira is a form of solidified emotion, created by the [[Inspired]] of [[Sarlona]] and manufactured in its [[bastion cities|bastion city]]. It has an opalescent, organic texture similar to polished horn; the color depends on the emotion used in its creation, and the wearer can feel that emotion as a constant background presence in their mind. As a material, sentira is light and extremely strong, similar to [[mithral]]; an agent of the [[Dreaming Dark]] might wear armor that's functionally mithral armor but actually made from sentira. The [[Harmonious Shield]] of [[Riedra]] has developed weapons made from sentira, including [[sentira lens]]es and [[sentira shard]]s.

The [[Adar]]an [[kalashtar]] also work with sentira, but don't have the facilities or resources to produce it in the same quantities as the [[Inspired]]. The horned headdresses known as //pela// worn by Adaran kalashtar are usually sculpted from sentira. A liquid form of sentira is used to make the Adaran beverage known as [[varit]].

!! Can Sentira Be Faked?

Can the emotions used to generate sentira can be artificially induced? Can you create love
with a [[charm]] effect, or generate fear with psychic power? The answer is "you can, but quality suffers." Fear sentira created with magical or psionic manipulation simply doesn't have the same strength and potency as sentira made from sustained, natural fear. This means certain emotions are much harder to produce in a factory setting. For example, love sentira is rarely made in [[Riedra]]—but it can be found in [[Adar]], where it’s crafted by hand.
