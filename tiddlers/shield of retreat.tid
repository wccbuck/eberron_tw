While wielding this wrought-iron shield, you can speak its command word to cause the shield to instantly shatter into twenty caltrops, which cover a roughly 5-foot-square area. This area is always behind you, and moves with you. The effect ends after 10 minutes, at which point the caltrops stay put and become nonmagical.
