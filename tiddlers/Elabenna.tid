Elabenna is an aging soothsayer who served many years as a [[Master|Master's Hall]] of the city of [[Io'lokar]]. Since then, she has built up an unofficial network of younger diviners
dedicated to reinterpreting the [[Draconic Prophecy]] as it relates to [[Io'lokar]]—or at least as Elabenna believes it does. This cabal has sponsored a number of scholarly expeditions into deepest [[Argonnessen]] as a result of Elabenna’s visions; three of them never returned. Now, Elabenna seeks foreign adventurers for her schemes. Such PCs can effectively set their own price in [[divination]] spells cast by Elabenna as payment for
such a mission.
