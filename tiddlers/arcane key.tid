An arcane key acts as a set of [[thieves' tools]] enchanted to allow the bearer to interact with mystical bonds and seals. It is able to suppress the effect of an [[arcane lock]] or [[arcane seal]] for up to 10 minutes. It is illegal to own an arcane key in most major cities across [[Khorvaire]], including [[Sharn]].
