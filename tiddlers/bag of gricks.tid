var: [[grick]] (green)

This ordinary bag, made from black cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, wet object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.

You can pull the wet lump from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a randomly-determined [[aberration]] or [[monstrosity]]. The creature melts into stinking goo and evaporates at the next dawn or when it is incapacitated.

The creature is ''not'' under your control, and acts on its own accord. It may be hostile to you or your companions.

Once three objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.
