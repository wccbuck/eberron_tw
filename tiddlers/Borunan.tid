title: Borunan
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Borunan is homeland to [[ogre]]s. It's a barren and hostile
region, spread across the [[Andnemun Desert]] and the
[[Kelshak Mountains]], and contains multiple wild zones tied to [[Fernia]] and [[Shavarath]], along with multiple passages into [[Khyber]]. Before the [[Sundering]], the ogres had a brutal and aggressive culture, dominated by powerful
[[oni]] lords. Despite their martial might, the ogres
rarely threatened the other kingdoms; the Borunan clans
considered [[human]]s to be unworthy foes and devoted
their energy to internal struggles.

Over the course of the [[Sundering]] and the Unification,
the ogres were brought under [[Riedra]]n rule and forcibly
converted to the [[Path of Inspiration]]. Those who resisted
were killed or driven into [[Syrkarn]], where they spawned
the [[eneko]]. Today the ogres are a surprisingly peaceful folk,
their warlike culture expunged by the [[Inspired]]. They are kept from the [[wild zone]]s that served as the strongholds of their ancestors, and largely kept from any form of war; they use their strength for manual labor as opposed to battle. Although
ogres form the bulk of the population in Borunan, all
villages have [[Chosen]] overseers, and [[human]] and [[shifter]]
troops are found in the handful of bastion cities.

The people of Borunan tend to be cheerful and
straightforward. Feats of strength are admired; a human
isn't expected to match an ogre but still earns respect for
proving his prowess. Athletic events typically include
weightlifting and throwing contests. 

The ogre village of [[Mokush]] lies on the Borunan frontier, near [[Syrkarn]].

!! The Old Kingdom

In the days before the [[Sundering]], the [[ogre]]s of Borunan were peerless warriors. The champions of Borunan possessed inhuman strength, martial discipline, unshakeable courage, and weapons forged in [[Fernia]]n flame. Time and again, they repelled the legions of [[Nulakesh]] and the crusaders of [[Khalesh]], and yet Borunan never sought to conquer any of its neighbors. Why not? Borunan is a harsh land; did the ogres never consider claiming the more fertile fields of Nulakesh?

It's commonly known that the people of Borunan considered their neighbors to be "unworthy foes" and the common assumption was that the ogres were cruel brutes who constantly fought one another. In fact, the ogres were waging a truly divine warâ€”fighting alongside [[angel]]s in an endless struggle against [[devil]]s. The center of Borunan contains a [[wild zone]] to [[Shavarath]], [[Gul Dol]], where a fragment of the Eternal Battleground extends directly into the Material Plane, and the ancient ogres devoted their might not to conquest, but to defending this keep against the forces of tyranny. 

The forerunners of the [[ogre]]s emerged from a [[demiplane]] within [[Khyber]]; tectonic activity destroyed this passage, leaving them stranded in this barren region of rocky desert and hills. Of the [[Shavaran|Shavarath]] [[wild zone]]s, only [[Gul Dol]] is a direct passage to the Eternal Battleground. But the ogres built their fortresses in the other Shavaran zones, and over generations the influence of Shavarath helped shape them into fierce warriors. In addition, the [[oni]] spell-smiths of ancient Borunan forged their weapons in the [[Cauldron]], a [[wild zone]] tied to [[Fernia]]. Their weapons weren't as well-crafted as the arms and armor of the [[Dhakaan]]i, but were imbued with powerful planar magic. But the ogrekin were singularly devoted to the battle for Gul Dol, believing that in fighting alongside the [[angel]]s, they were fighting for the freedom of all people.

!!! The Fall of Borunan

Despite the might of its champions, Borunan was easily laid low by the [[Dreaming Dark]]. The [[human]]s of the surrounding regions had long feared the [[ogre]]s, and it was easy for the [[quori]] to fan these flames. Within Borunan itself, the quori sowed doubts and created feuds, shattering centuries of unity. //Were the [[oni]] secretly in league with [[devil]]s? Was the battle for [[Gul Dol]] a pointless sacrifice?// Civil strife decimated Borunan and left it vulnerable to outside attack.
