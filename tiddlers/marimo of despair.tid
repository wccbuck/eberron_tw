This large ball of moss has a velvety surface, and seems to constantly emit a damp, black mist that smells faintly of water lilies. When thrown at a hard surface, this ball of moss splatters and emits a cloud of black mist; any creature within the 30-foot-diameter cloud is subjected to the [[fear]] spell.
