        "text": "The Lycaeum is the easternmost quarter of\n[[Metrol]] and once had much in common with the\n[[University District]] of [[Sharn]]. Cut off from the\nrest of Metrol by the [[River Melandor]] and connected to [[Crown Point]] via the Crown Bridge, it was a city\nwithin a city designed to support the student\npopulation. The Lycaeum today lies nearly entirely within the [[dead-gray mists]] of the [[Mournland]].\n\nThe Lycaeum, clustered around the\n[[Vermishard of Lore]], included a large public\nschool, a few smaller boarding schools, and\nseveral universities—the most prestigious of\nwhich were the [[Wynarn Institute of Art]], as well as the [[Vermishard Academy|Vermishard of Lore]] atop the\ncentral spire. The area also included taverns\ncatering to the student population and housing\nfor the staff (some of which was in the Lycaeum’s\n[[Undercity|Metrol Undercity]]). \n\n!! Noteworthy Locations\n\n* The [[Vermishard of Lore]]\n* The [[Wynarn Institute of Art]]\n* [[Olladra Smiles]]\n* The former [[Demesne of Shadow|Demesne of Shadow (Metrol)]]",
