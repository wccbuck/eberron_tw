Its back is covered in bony plates that serve as the foundation for a small town: a [[halfling]] settlement of tents, yurts, and small wooden structures. This town is able to avoid <<navAndScrollToHeader \"Talenta Plains\" \"the Haunting Curse\">> of the Plains due to the fact that the great beast never stops roaming. In fact, the Great Hammertail often seems to wander outside the bounds of the Material Plane, vanishing like a [[feyspire]]. During these times, which the residents of the town call \"Elsewhering,\" attempts to [[divine|divination]] its location yield nonsensical answers, and residents of the town who hop off the beast find themselves stranded in the middle of the [[Plains|Talenta Plains]]. The Great Hammertail's appearing and disappearing seem to happen at random, but some Talenta shamans claim they can predict its arrivals.\n\nThose who find themselves on the back of the Great Hammertail may have the opportunity to form a bond with the massive beast, gaining [[fey]] blessings in exchange for favors or tests. In fact, the Great Hammertail can even serve as an immortal patron for a [[warlock]]. A player character could reflavor the [[Genie's Vessel]] [[talent]] for this; instead of traveling into a magical vessel, their sanctuary could be a tent on the back of the Hammertail!",
