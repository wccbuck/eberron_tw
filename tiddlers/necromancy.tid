type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The [[school|spell school]] of necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and [[undeath|undead]]. Manipulation of these forces is considered taboo by many societies, but necromancers are not intrinsically evil. Necromancy tends to fall into three categories: [[Mabar]]an, [[Dolurrh]]i, and [[Irian]].

Practitioners of [[Mabar]]an necromancy learn to manipulate negative energy to [[animate once-living things|animate dead]]. As they progress, they may learn to sap the life force from a creature as their magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power they can manipulate.

[[Dolurrh]]i necromancy involves interaction with the souls of the recently deceased, such as through the spell [[speak with dead]]. Powerful bearers of the [[Mark of Healing]] and [[cleric]]s with potent conduits to [[divine power|divine magic]] can [[raise the dead|raise dead]], an act which truly restores a living creature to life, and does not create an [[undead]] creature.

[[Irian]] necromancy involves infusing the once-living with positive energy, and sustaining the resulting [[deathless]] entity with the devotion of the living. This is the form of necromancy that sustains the [[Undying Court]].

!! Necromancy in the Five Nations

Necromancy has a sinister reputation in the [[Five Nations]]. Its practice isn't illegal, just unsavory. Common folk shun necromancy for many reasons—after
all, [[undead]] are a real, dangerous force in the world. [[Ghoul|ghoul]]s,
[[shadow]]s, and [[wraith]]s are all concrete threats, and undead
thus trigger instinctive fear in most people. Compounding
this, many people believe that the spirits of the dead ultimately
reach some form of peace beyond [[Dolurrh]]—whether with
the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]] or the [[Silver Flame]]—so any sort of magic that
interacts with the dead may disturb that rest. Vassals also tend
to inter their dead and find the manipulation of corpses to be
disrespectful and revolting.

While necromancy itself isn’t illegal under the [[Code of Galifar]], grave robbing certainly is. An officer of the law in the [[Five Nations]] could demand that a necromancer present proof of their ownership of the corpses in their [[undead]] entourage—though
most officers rarely do so. In [[Karrnath]], necromancers authorized by the [[Ministry of the Dead]] are issued warrants that authorize them to “compel the corpse of any Karrnathi citizen into service,” so their ownership is easy to establish as legitimate. Likewise, priests of the [[Blood of Vol]] have long raised the corpses of followers of the faith, so their claims generally go undisputed. However, if you kill someone then raise them as a [[zombie]], the [[Sharn Watch]] might not be able to prove you killed that person, but they can certainly prosecute you as a corpse robber! This usually results in a fine and the confiscation (and destruction) of the zombie.

[[Atur]] in [[Karrnath]] is the primary center for necromantic
research in the [[Five Nations]] (see [[Atur Academy]]), but [[Arcanix]] has its own school of
necromancy—albeit its smallest and least funded. This school primarily focuses on [[Dolurrh]]i necromancy, such as the [[speak with dead]] spell, rather than on offensive magic or the creation of [[undead]].
