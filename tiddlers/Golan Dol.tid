//This dwarf has surely seen the passage of centuries. His beardless face is deeply lined, and old burns paint a map of scars across the left side of his head. His wears a beautiful shirt of [[mithral]] mail, but time has stripped away muscle, and the armor hangs on his emaciated frame. Despite his fragile appearance, he holds a heavy warhammer with a steady grip; the head of the hammer is surrounded by a nimbus of silver flames. His eyes are gray, his gaze sharp and calculating; his voice is raspy, but confident.//

Golan Dol is perhaps the greatest living blacksmith on the continent of [[Khorvaire]]. He served as Master of the Forge for the nation of [[Thrane]] through the full duration of the [[Silver Crusade]], but resigned in 888 YK and withdrew from the public eye. Today he lives in seclusion in [[Flamekeep]].

!! Background

Golan Dol was born to a clan of warriors in [[Breland]], and his parents expected him to follow the traditional path to the field of battle. But Golan had a different calling. As a child, he was fascinated by fire; he believed that he could hear voices in the crackling of flames, whispering secrets of steel and gold. Whether he was in fact touched by magic or simply delusional, he proved to have a remarkable talent at the forge, in both metal-working and making [[magic item]]s. He was apprenticed to a local smith, but swiftly outpaced the skills of his master, becoming a [[magewright]] of remarkable skill. Many said that Golan was blessed by the [[Sovereign|Sovereign Host]] [[Onatar]], but Golan himself became captivated by the doctrine of the Church of the [[Silver Flame]], and soon traveled to [[Thrane]] to serve as an armorer to the [[templar]]s. As decades passed, his skill and reputation increased by leaps and bounds. He was brought to [[Flamekeep]], and in 820 YK he was appointed Master of the Forge. Fire was his specialty, and he created [[flaming weapons|flame tongue]] and armor and shields that could [[protect the wearer from heat|armor of resistance]]. Golan proudly forged blades for the greatest champions of the age.

In 832 YK, the church began its [[Silver Crusade]] against the [[lycanthropic curse|therianthrope]] in the [[Towering Wood]]. In the beginning, all believed this was a righteous cause: the threat was clear, and the [[templar]]s were all that stood between innocents and horror. Flaming [[silver blades|silvered weapon]], [[wands of fireballs|wand of fireballs]], [[bracers of archery]]—Golan worked tirelessly to supply the soldiers of the [[Silver Flame]] with the tools they needed to fight the battle. Decades passed, and the tide of battle turned; what had been a desperate struggle against an unstoppable tide of evil slowly became a ruthless purge. Stories trickled back to [[Flamekeep]] about entire villages of [[shifter]]s slain due to paranoia, and public opinion began to turn against the [[Keeper of the Flame]]. Golan began to suffer from terrible nightmares, in which he saw the faces of those killed by his magical weapons. He was stricken by fears that he was serving as a tool of the [[Shadow in the Flame|Bel Shalor]]… and in 888 YK, he resigned from his position as Master of the Forge, disappearing from the public eye.

In 894 YK, the [[Last War]] began. King [[Thalin|Thalin ir'Wynarn]] of [[Thrane]] asked Golan to help equip the armies of the nation, while Golan’s relatives demanded that the smith return to his family’s ancestral home in [[Breland]] and serve Queen [[Wroann|Wroann ir'Wynarn]]. Golan refused both. Little is known of his activities over the next century. He moved from village to village, supporting local militias and battling invaders, but rarely revealed his full talents. Some say that he forged a blade for Kaith Serrain, the first [[Keeper of the Flame]] to rule the nation of [[Thrane]] in 914, but others claim that this was propaganda on the part of the [[cardinals|Council of Cardinals]]. 

With the war’s end, Golan has returned to his home in [[Flamekeep]]. He has remained in seclusion, rebuffing emissaries from Cardinal [[Krozen]] and Queen [[Diani|Diani ir'Wynarn]] alike. After his century of absence, many have forgotten Golan Dol—but his works are still legendary. 

!! Personality

Golan is a stern and taciturn man. While he still has a deep and abiding faith in the principles of the [[Silver Flame]], he no longer trusts the hierarchy of the church—though the [[nobles|Nobility of the Five Nations]] of the [[Five Nations]] and the [[dragonmarked barons|dragonmarked house]] are certainly no better. Everything is uncertain, and even the most well-intentioned actions can lead to tragedy. As a result, he keeps to himself, listening to the crackling fire and trying to decide if he hears demons or divinity.

Golan is 366 years old. Time has sapped his strength and speed, and he knows that he could die any day. He continues to hone his skills, forging swords only to melt them down and start again. He has done everything possible to maintain a low profile since his return to [[Flamekeep]]. He does not see guests, and has not left his home in over a year. He shares his abode with three [[warforged]] (Rusty, Twelve, and Calo), former soldiers he met during his travels; today these warforged serve as both apprentices and guards, performing whatever tasks must be done in the outside world. Conversation is kept to a minimum in the house, but the warforged are comfortable working in silence.

In addition to his study of magic and [[religion]], Golan is a historian with a particular interest in the Empire of [[Dhakaan]]. The Dhakaani smiths possessed metallurgical secrets and other techniques that have yet to be duplicated in the modern age, and Golan is always interested in acquiring Dhakaani relics.

Golan is a skilled and courageous warrior, but he’s also an old man. He won’t back down when a cause is just, but he’ll always look for alternatives to battle. He has a good heart, but he is plagued by self-doubt and cynicism, and this often prevents him from using his skills in the cause of good.

!! Adventure Hooks

Consider the following hooks to incorporate Golan Dol into your story.

* A party with ties to [[Breland]] is approached by Captain [[Khandan Dol]], the commander of the elite [[Redcloak Battalion]] unit stationed in [[Sharn]]. Khandan is Golan’s grandnephew, and he has sad news: Golan’s brother has just died. Khandan wants the party to locate Golan and convince him to return to [[Breland]] for the funeral, to lay old feuds to rest; Golan won’t listen to another member of the Dol clan. But is this touching tale true? Perhaps the Dols want to force Golan to work for Breland—or just want to get him out of his house so they can loot it, reclaiming some family heirloom. Perhaps “Khandan Dol” isn’t who he appears to be, but is instead an agent of House [[Thuranni]], a member of the [[Cabinet of Faces]], or even a [[rakshasa]]!
* When the party acquires a number of non-magical [[Dhakaan]]i weapons, they are approached by a [[warforged]] who makes a very generous offer for these items. This initial exchange could result in Golan becoming a patron for the party—a regular buyer for Dhakaani goods, and a source of information about possible Dhakaani sites.
* A party with [[warforged]] could get to know Golan through his three warforged companions, who speak with awe of the skills of their instructor and benefactor. Golan trusts warforged slightly more than most creatures, and could become the patron of a warforged PC.
* Golan is one of the finest weaponsmiths on [[Khorvaire]]. Looking for a [[flaming burst weapon]]? He could make it. A vision, prophecy, or simple desire to have the best one can have could lead a character—especially a follower of the [[Silver Flame]]—to Golan, in search of a truly legendary weapon. But it will take far more than gold to convince Golan to forge a new blade. And creating a masterwork weapon may require unique magical components, things the PCs will have to quest for. The [[adamantine]] flail of a goblin champion; an Eberron [[dragonshard]] of incomparable purity; the heart of a [[rakshasa]]. The magnificent blade isn’t waiting in a dungeon, it’s waiting to be made; but the PCs may have to go to a dungeon (or many dungeons) to get what Golan needs to make it.
* If a party knows Golan, they can come to visit him only to find he has been kidnapped. Who is responsible? A government? House [[Cannith]]? The [[Lord of Blades]]? The [[Aurum]]? What terrible project will he be forced to work on?
