        "text": "Venerable Thatari is an aged [[kalashtar]] psionic preceptor associated with the elders\nof [[Tashalatora]], to whom she usually speaks by using her powers. She was once a fierce warrior and an eager adversary against the forces of [[Riedra]] and the [[Dreaming Dark]]. Today, she is one of the few [[psion]]s in [[Adar]] who can manifest [[psychic chirurgery]] and [[reality revision]],\nand thus she might be the only one who can save a PC from\na [[mind seed]] or similar psionic afflictions. Unfortunately\nfor seekers who want to speak with her, Thatari lives in the\nmountains many miles from Tashalatora, alone within a\ncave carved into a cliff face. Getting to her requires finding out where she is and traversing treacherous terrain inhabited by unfriendly creatures. What she might ask of those seeking her aid is unknown, but such a request will\nsurely have little to do with wealth. ",
