type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The sprawling complex of the [[Dragon Towers]] [[Tharashk]] [[Enclave|enclave]] occupies several levels of three towers near the [[Sword Point]] district. A significant percentage of [[Sharn]]'s [[half-orc]] population lives in this complex. [[Yevgen Torrn]] leads the enclave, and operates as a very expensive [[inquisitive]]-for-hire.
