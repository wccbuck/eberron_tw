title: What About Boost Attempts That "Deal Damage"?
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The purpose of a [[boost]] action is to support, but not directly advance, the goals of a scene; if one wants to fill in segments of a [[progress clock]], they should attempt an [[overcome]] action. But what about cases in which a player wants to boost their character's [[momentum]], but they describe their character directly causing harm to an opponent or taking another "direct" action which is more commonly associated with an [[overcome]]? 

The answer is: That's okay! It's still a boost! They still gain momentum on a success, and they still don't advance the progress clock. Even if the character is literally striking a monster with a sword, if the player is using a [[boost]] action, they must describe how striking the monster grants them leverage to help their character or an ally complete this challenge with a future attempt. Remember: [[progress clock]]s are pacing tools, not hit points.
