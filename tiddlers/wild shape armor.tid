Ordinarily, a [[druid]] cannot benefit from armor they are wearing when they use their [[wild shape|Wild Shape (talent)]] to transform into another creature; it merges into their new form. But with this armor, which appears to be made from magically hardened animal hide, resizes as a druid transforms, continuing to provide protection while in wild shape.
