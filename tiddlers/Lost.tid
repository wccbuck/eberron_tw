tooltip: hidden settlement of changelings in Droaam
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In a land where a gaze or a song can kill, the
shapeshifting ability of the [[changeling]]s receives little
notice. As a result, these creatures have an easier time
in [[Droaam]] than elsewhere in [[Khorvaire]]. Changelings
are common in [[Graywall]] and the [[Great Crag]], moving
about in their natural forms.

Rumors tell of an entire settlement of [[changeling]]s and [[doppelganger]]s hidden somewhere in [[Droaam]], its location known only to the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]]. The buildings of this place, known simply as Lost, are said to be giant [[mimic]]s, transforming into cliffs or trees to deceive the eyes of strangers. The folk of Lost have mastered a number of powerful rituals, and some of the greatest unsolved thefts in history are thought to be their doing.

!! The Traveler's Chosen

The priests of Lost say that their ancestors came to [[Khorvaire]] from across the sea, fleeing slavery in [[Ohr Kaluun]] and the [[Sundering]] of [[Sarlona]]. During this time of upheaval, the [[Traveler]] visited them in the form of one of their own. With a word, he turned the trees into houses; with a gesture, he hid the village from prying eyes. He taught his people to speak in silence, to hear the thoughts of others, and to master their shapeshifting gifts in ways they’d never imagined. In exchange, the people of Lost swore to bring confusion to his enemies and change to the world.

The [[changeling]]s of Lost are exceptional thieves, and many fine things now reside in Lost’s vaults of holding. In keeping with the doctrine of the [[Traveler]], they often share their ill-gotten gains with others. They have revealed the secrets of [[dragonmarked house]]s to rivals in other houses; stolen royal treasures and placed them in the hands of would-be usurpers; freed prisoners and exposed fugitives. On one hand, their actions have brought about chaos and death; on the other, they have also inspired positive change and innovation.

Culturally, the [[changeling]]s of Lost are different from their kin in the East. For a child of Lost, face and name are a form of artistic expression. They find joy in change, both within the individual and the ripples they create in the lives of others. Although each changeling has a unique thought-symbol that serves as a true name, the people of Lost are apathetic regarding permanent identity in a way that that outsiders find disconcerting.

The inhabitants of Lost function under a loose social hierarchy centered around the priests of the [[Traveler]]. Although they are allied with [[Droaam]] and serve the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] as spies and [[inquisitive]]s, it is as a form of tribute ensuring that the Daughters leave them alone. Their first loyalty is to the Traveler, and they continue their work in his name.

!!! A Clever Facade

The gifts of the [[changeling]]s help them hide in plain sight; the village of Lost is equally blessed, for its “buildings” are alive. Within moments, Lost can become a [[gnoll]] camp, a [[Vadalis]] [[magebreeding]] out-post, a grove of greatpines, or any number of other forms. 

The [[mimic]]-like creatures that form Lost are called ''facades''. A facade can transform its exterior appearance to resemble any sort of stationary object, from a stone outcropping or massive tree to a small house. It takes around twenty seconds to complete such a transformation. Facades are simple creatures and need to be given telepathic direction to assume complex forms.

Facades subsist through photosynthesis and by laying down roots through which they draw nutrients from the soil. If attacked, a facade will shift its skin to the texture of stone. The creatures can’t fight enemies, but they are very durable and can shrug off most wounds. While rooted, a facade is incapable of movement. It takes another twenty seconds for it to pull up its roots, after which it moves slowly by sliding along the ground like a slug. When the people of Lost wish to move long distances, they telepathically guide the facades to take the forms of wagons so that they can travel more swiftly.

Facades are naturally immune to any form of [[scrying]], and this protection extends to any creature or object within the creature. If a [[wizard]] standing next to a facade scries on his current location, he will see nothing of interest.

!! What Brings You To Lost?

Lost is a legend. What might bring adventurers there? What makes it a compelling part of an adventure?

* ''For Breland:'' Commander [[Vron]] of the [[King's Dark Lanterns]] wishes to make contact with the leaders of Lost to determine if he can forge an alliance between the [[Citadel|King's Citadel]] and the [[changeling]]s. Can the adventurers succeed where the Citadel Elite have failed?
* ''Cold Case:'' An [[overlord]] is stirring in [[Thrane]], and the adventurers need the //Tears of Tira//—a relic of the [[Silver Flame]]—to lay it to rest. There’s just one problem: The relic was stolen in the wake of the [[Silver Crusade]]. Stories say [[shifter]] raiders destroyed the shrine and stole it. Can the party discover the truth and track the relic to the vaults of Lost?
* ''Chance Encounter:'' While traveling across [[Droaam]], the adventurers encounter a marvelous carnival that is actually Lost in disguise. Adventurers who choose to play the potentially lethal games can earn real treasures, but the prizes sometimes pack unexpected consequences. When they acquire the scepter of the last [[Dhakaan]]i emperor, the party becomes the target of a dozen [[goblin]] [[clans|kech]]. How will they resolve the situation?
* ''Aureon's Justice:'' The actions of the Traveler aren’t always evil, but they are a source of chaos. Now that Lost is actively tied to Droaam, the Traveler’s servants have caught the eye of the Sovereign Host. Divine characters aligned with the Host might be charged to find Lost and give its leaders a chance to atone for their actions. If Lost’s leaders refuse, the adventurers must find a way to bring down the priests of the Traveler.
* ''Lords of Dust:'' A [[Lord of Dust|Lords of Dust]] and his lesser [[rakshasa]] servants infiltrate Lost and replace the council of priests; the [[changeling]]s become unwitting tools of this new master. Adventurers might search for Lost to destroy the Lord of Dust and the changelings alike, or they might aid a fugitive changeling who asks them to help drive the evil from the hidden village.
* ''Changeling Destiny:'' A [[changeling]] character is approached by a [[doppelganger]] and told that his destiny lies in Lost. If he can find the hidden village, he will receive divine boons or grandmaster training and be set on the path that leads to his epic destiny. But one should always beware the gifts of the [[Traveler]]... 
* ''Profit:'' The adventurers hear tales of the impressive and numerous treasures stolen by the [[changeling]]s. Although the shapeshifters have redistributed many of these items over the years, Lost remains a trove worthy of plunder—if the party can find it and claim the stolen goods.
