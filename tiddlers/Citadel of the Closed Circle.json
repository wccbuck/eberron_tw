        "text": "In the dawn of [[Sharn]], there were three [[wizard]]'s circles: The [[Esoteric Order of Aureon]], the [[Guild of Starlight and Shadows]], and the [[Closed Circle]]. The wizards of the Closed Circle were interested in the lore of the [[daelkyr]], and soon developed strong ties to the [[Cults of the Dragon Below]]. Eventually their work began to frighten the other two circles; it came to a war of wizards, and the Closed Circle was sealed in its fortress in the undercity. Now, centuries later, the Dragon Below has returned to this arcane fortress. A [[mind flayer]] named [[Chyrassk]] has emerged from [[Khyber]] and broken the seals of this ancient dungeon. Chyrassk brought a small force from Khyber—[[dolgaunt]]s, [[dolgrim]]s, and an [[umber hulk]]—but he has begun to build up a [[human]] following, especially among the refugees of [[Cyre]]. He has found many disturbing and powerful relics in this fortress. ",
