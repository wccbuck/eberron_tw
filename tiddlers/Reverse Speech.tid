The [[Shadow]] has revealed hidden secrets of spellcasting to you. When you cast a [[spell]] that requires you to speak magic words, you can speak them backward and expend 1 additional spellcasting [[stress]] to reveal hidden meanings in your utterances. For the duration of the spell, each target that knows at least one [[language]] and can hear you understands what you say. In addition, if the spell would cause a target to be charmed (i.e. regard you as a friendly acquaintance), you can choose for that creature to be frightened instead, and vice versa, though all other effects of the spell apply as if the original condition were in effect. If the spell targets multiple creatures, you can choose whether to charm or frighten each creature separately.
