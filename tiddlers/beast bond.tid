You establish a telepathic link with one [[beast]] you touch that is friendly to you or [[charm]]ed by you. The spell fails if the beast is sapient. Until the spell ends (after 10 minutes, or sooner if your concentration is broken), the link is active while you and the beast are within line of sight of each other. Through the link, the beast can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you.
