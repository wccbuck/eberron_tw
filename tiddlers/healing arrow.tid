This magic ammunition is made by [[cleric]]s of [[Balinor]]. An attack made with this ammunition deals no damage to any target hit by it. When you launch this ammunition from a bow or crossbow and hit a creature other than yourself, that creature rapidly recovers from injury (moderate-[[impact]] [[magical healing]]). Once it hits a creature, the ammunition dissolves into pure healing magic before it's destroyed. This ammunition has no effect on [[undead]] or [[construct]]s (but does affect [[deathless]] and [[warforged]]).
