        "text": "The Refuge of [[Irian]] is a vast fortress-monastery, though it has aspects\nof a spa as well. It's filled with tranquil groves, soothing baths,\nand places to rest and reflect. The fortress walls don't represent\npotential conflict, but rather speak to the absolute security of\nthe placeâ€”within its walls, you are safe from all threats. The\nRefuge holds healers who can treat your injuries, mediators\nwho can talk through problems, and sages who may not know\nthe answers you need, but can point you in the right direction.\nThis isn't a place where adventures occur; it's where you\nrecover from your injuries and plan your next move, knowing\nthat you're safe and that there are answers to every problem. [[Araam]] is the [[Architect]] of the Refuge and embodies the concept of hope. \n\nWhile not all layers of Araam's realm provide the security\nand succor of the Refuge itself, they all can provide comfort\nand hope. They don't have the absolute peace of [[Syrania]],\nbut they make people feel there's hope. Irian has no match\nfor the [[Immeasurable Market]] of Syrania, so if you're looking\nfor commerce, the Azure Sky has more options. But for\nadventurers who seek a relaxing vacation in the planes, the\nRefuge is unparalleled.",
