type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
