        "text": "Lord Aehion Hanius Hayttear is a wealthy [[gnome]] noble who immigrated to [[Sharn]] from [[Zilargo]] four years ago. A smooth and chic aristocrat, Aehion is always well dressed, sporting close cut brown hair and beard and a large smile. He is a minor shareholder in the //Breland Ledger//, the [[Korranberg Chronicle]], and the [[Sharn Inquisitive]] [[newspaper]]s. He also owns a substantial publishing house, with interests from the lowest handbill printing to publishing the latest poets. Lord Hayttear dwells in a breathtaking mansion in the Azure neighborhood of [[Skyway]].\n\nUnbeknownst to none but himself, Lord Hayttear possesses an [[aberrant dragonmark]], but he has no interest in aligning himself with House [[Tarkanan]]. A descendant of the [[Dreambreaker]], Aehion intends to hire one of [[Sharn]]'s [[adventurers' guild]]s to recover the [[Delirium Stone]] from the depths of the city, which he believes will amplify his own powers and transform him into an unstoppable aberrant lord.\n",
