        "text": "Commander Lian Halamar is a male [[halfling]] who\nleads the [[garrison|Daggerwatch Garrison]] in the [[Daggerwatch]] district in\n[[Upper Dura]]. \n\nLian's connections to the [[Boromar Clan]] helped him rise to his current\nrank, but he is not a puppet to his halfling brethren. Lian presses the Boromars just hard enough to make sure they keep up their regular payments. As\na result, parties might get lucky and receive some\nhelp from the Watch when fighting Boromars. But more often than not, the Watch is nowhere to be found during major Clan operations. Recently, the Boromars have been pressing Lian to take stronger action against [[Daask]], but the halfling has no interest in getting caught in the middle of the crime war erupting in the lower towers.
