        "text": "[[Dolurrh]]'s [[Vault of Memories]] merely contains records of every mortal soul\nthat's passed through it. By contrast, [[Daanvi]]'s Infinite Archive\ncontains records on every being that's ever existed. Here, the\ndata gathered by the [[Panopticon]] and the rulings of the [[Hall of Justice]] are recorded and efficiently preserved. Records focus on\neach individual's deeds, whether they've adhered to or violated\ncountless codes of legal and moral standards. Daanvi doesn't\ngenerally do anything with this data; they have no jurisdiction\nto act on it. So through your life, the immortals of Daanvi have\nwatched and judged your every action. You aren't rewarded or\npunished for your deeds, but they know what you've done, and\nit's forever preserved on your permanent record.\n\nMortals must present an excellent reason—or bribe a [[devil]]—to get access to the Archive, but it's not as restricted as the\n[[Panopticon]]. The Infinite Archive lives up to its name, and is\nunknowably vast. If adventurers have a legitimate inquiry, a [[deva]]\nsage can be quite helpful. Working with [[modron]]s is a long and\ntedious process, while devils make it even more unpleasant.",
