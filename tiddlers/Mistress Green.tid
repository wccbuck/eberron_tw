The [[elf]] known as Mistress Green has served as the steward of [[Castle Arakhain]] for at least three hundred years. No one knows exactly how old she is, and most aren’t sure if “Green” is her first or last name. She is a strict taskmaster who makes sure that everything is perfectly in order and maintained in accordance with tradition. She often invokes previous monarchs—“This would never have happened in [[Wroann|Wroann ir'Wynarn]]’s day.”

Mistress Green is devoted to [[Breland]] and would never gossip… but she undoubtedly knows a trove of interesting stories about modern and past [[nobles|Nobility of the Five Nations]].
