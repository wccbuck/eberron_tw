Formians are [[immortal]] entities that originate from the [[plane]] of [[Daanvi]], occupying [[layer]]s known as Hives. They resemble a cross between an ant and a centaur, covered in a brownish-red carapace. Formian Hives resemble perfectly structured insectoid colonies. Some Hives are merely dedicated to caring for their queen, a bloated entity served by loyal myrmarch formians; other Hives are expansionist to the extreme, capturing other creatures ([[manifestation]]s or occasionally even mortals) and putting them to work building and expanding their cities.

Formians speak the [[Daan]] language in a droning, chittering dialect.
