A dome of force covers the top of this cavernous well, with garrison aeries carved into the walls of the abyssal shaft. Shifting light rises from the bottom\u2014the\npulsing colors of the immense [[Khyber shard|dragonshard]] that holds the spirit of Tiamat, slowly shifting through the ten colors of true [[dragon]]s. Even in her slumber, Tiamat\u2019s\nmind is so powerful that anyone who passes beyond the dome of force can feel her presence. It is assumed that no [[dragon]] can resist her touch forever. A dragon of the [[Light of Siberys]] must volunteer for guard duty in the Pit, and when their tour of\nduty is complete, they are executed, to ensure that their spirit has remained pure. It is a one-way mission, but those who survive it untainted and accept execution with dignity\nbring great honor to their flights.\n\nThe Pit of Five Sorrows holds many secrets, and it is\none of the most carefully warded and secured locations\non [[Eberron]]. An effort to penetrate the Pit should be a\nchallenge for advanced epic-level characters.", "modified": "20210727192025044", "tags": "Argonnessen [[Light of Siberys (region)]] dungeon", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "article": "the ", "category": "location", "color": "#3B5C0A", "points": "-23.622,81.01", "style": "{\"color\": \"#40262D\"}"}
