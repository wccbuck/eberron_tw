Hostess Channa Perryn blesses every meal in the name of [[Olladra]] and [[Boldrei]], and Cord Perryn performs services in the back room. Neither Cord nor Channa are spellcasters, but they provide spiritual guidance to followers of the Host. Room and board at the House of the Nine is quite inexpensive, but there are only four rooms in the inn.",
