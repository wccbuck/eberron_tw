Even the most basic Gold Line coach is well appointed and maintained, and charges twice the usual price for travel (see the <<navAndScrollToHeader \"Wards of Sharn\" \"Travel Time\">> section of [[Wards of Sharn]] for specifics). The Gold Line also has three “party barges” and two //gilded fliers//, which are twice as fast as the typical [[skycoach]]. Gold Line coaches are usually only found in [[Skyway]] and the [[upper districts|upper ward]], and its higher end coaches can only be booked by appointment.",
