Steel Maw is an [[ogre]] who was captured near [[Dar Qat]] and sold into slavery in the [[Red Ring]]. He is a new addition to the Sin Spear stable. His cruel stablemaster, a woman named Shalstri Griteye, had a giant steel mask with a razored maw riveted to the ogreâ€™s skull. The poor beast is forcefed a mind-shredding narcotic called [[wrathweed|wrath]]. He no longer retains any sense of self beyond the fury that
incites him in the ring.
