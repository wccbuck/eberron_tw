Brightwort is a faintly luminescent plant that is immensely useful in the creation of [[potions of healing|potion of healing]] and other restorative elixirs. Most casual botanists assume that brightwort is connected to [[Irian]], like [[Araam's crown]], another potent medicinal herb. But there is nothing natural about the way this herb promotes flesh to knit and blood to clot; it is a creation of the [[daelkyr]] [[Avassh]], the Twister of Roots.
