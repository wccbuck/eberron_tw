The [[dreamspace]] threads through you to wrap a creature within 30 feet in a web of dazing energy. You must be [[dreamtouched]] to use this psionic power.

The target is wrapped in the otherworldly energy of the [[dreamspace]], altering its perceptions and behavior. The creature enters a state of waking dreaming, and is unable to differentiate the random visions of the dream from reality, for up to 1 minute.

Creatures that do not dream are ''not'' immune to the effect of this spell unless they are also immune to enchantments or mind-affecting phenomena.

If you cast this spell while in a [[dreamtouched]] state, you can partially direct the random visions that plague the target creature. This allows you to influÂ­ence the actions of the target as if using a [[suggestion]] spell.

!! Rare-Tier

When you cast //{{!!title}}// as a rare-[[tier|spell tier]] spell, you may target up to 5 creatures within 30 feet of each other. Any suggested course of activity will be directed to all creatures simultaneously, and will be ignored if inapplicable.
