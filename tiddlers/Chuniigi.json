But the Chuniigi populace is\nsparse relative to their territories, and they share the wild northern lands with many [[human]] tribes. In recent years, the northern Tashana has been ravaged by the terrible [[Kalaak]] barbarians, and these incursions have reduced the Chuniigi's\nnumbers further still. \n\nSee also [[Culture of the Tashana shifters]].\n\n''Chok'', one of the tribes of the Chuniigi, is led by chief [[Chok-Palla]].",
