Yawning wide in the northern\nreaches of the Wastes, the site is a deep chasm whose\ncrumbling walls drop away into darkness.\n\nThe place takes its name from a legendary chamber in its depths. Beyond the River of Blood and Bone, the Chamber of Secret Thoughts, and the Legion of the Forgotten Dead, there dwells a great [[dragon]]—some say a [[dracolich]]—said to be an aspect of the [[Lord of Death and Decay|Keeper]]. This creature houses souls trapped\nin Khyber [[dragonshard]]s sprouting from the walls. (See [[Mazyralyx]].)\nFoul cultists of the [[Dark Six]] make forays to the site, offering up their wicked prayers. \n\nThe Lair of the Keeper and the chasm that surrounds it are powerful [[manifest zone]]s to [[Dolurrh]], the Realm of the Dead.",
