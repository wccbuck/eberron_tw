        "text": "The Last Tower is the courthouse of [[Graywall]]. It is also the last place many of those who come before a [[Katra's Voice]] magistrate ever see. The tower serves both\nas a prison and as a center for torture. [[Droaam]]ish law doesn’t believe in incarceration as a form of rehabilitation, and prisoners are only held if they are waiting for transfer, execution, or serving a sentence in the [[arena|Bloodstone Arena]] (which can last days or weeks). Public executions are held in the plaza, and statues are also\narranged around the tower—these are victims petrified by the [[medusa]] magistrate and left as a warning to others. Typically, the justice has the right hand of a petrified victim removed, to ensure that if the victim is restored it is at least maimed.",
