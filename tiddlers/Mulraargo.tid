type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Deep in the soggy fens and stinking bogs of [[Xen'drik]]
lurks a thing as silent as shadow, whose form shifts
from a towering, taloned fury to a slinking, putrescent sludge of black oil. Mulraargo appears as a [[troll]] with oil-slick black skin sporting boils and sores that
weep a vicious sludge at all times. More than a few
reports claim that the monstrous troll can melt away
into a puddle of black [[ooze]]. This would account for
the trollâ€™s unrivaled skill at stealth and ambush and
explain why no hunter can track the creature. Mulraargo enjoys picking off members of an expedition one at a time, savoring the mounting fear among the
survivors almost as much he does the flesh of their
captured companions.
