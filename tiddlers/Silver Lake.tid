Silver Lake is a freshwater lake that borders the [[Eldeen Reaches]] to the northwest and [[Breland]] to the south and east, as well as [[Droaam]] in the west. Silver Lake and [[Lake Galifar]] are connected by way of a [[river|Silver River]] that runs near the towns of [[Erlaskar]] and [[Xandrar]].

Silver Lake has ties to [[Thelanis]] and is home to [[fey]] spirits. The Thelanian connection is strongest along the southern coast, but there is magic in the water. The [[Greensinger|Greensingers]] [[Stillwater]] in [[Sylbaran]] and their initiates help to keep the lake peaceful, and thereâ€™s almost always a Greensinger [[gleaner]] singing on the docks. The fisherfolk of [[Sylbaran]] are likewise known for singing as they fish, songs honoring both the fish and the fey.
