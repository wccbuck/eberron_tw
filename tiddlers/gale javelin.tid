title: gale javelin
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The metallic head of this javelin is embellished with three small wings. When you speak a command word while throwing this magic weapon, a swirling vortex of wind follows its path through the air, extending 10 feet from the javelin's path. Creatures hit by the wind or by the javelin who can't resist the wind are pushed backward, and possibly knocked prone.
