type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Capital:'' [[Korth]]<br/>
''Hallmarks:'' Ale, dairy, glass, livestock, lumber, martial discipline, paper, textiles, [[undead]] <br/>
''Population:'' <<ntls>> (52% [[human]]s, 18% [[dwarves|dwarf]], 10% [[halfling]]s, 8% [[half-elves|half-elf]], 8% [[elves|elf]], 4% other)

In a nation of storms and long winters, the grim and
stoic Karrns are accustomed to enduring hardship without complaint.

First and foremost, Karrnath is known for its military
tradition. Strength, strategy, and discipline are the core
values of Karrnath. Karrnath's soldiers might be the
finest in [[Khorvaire]], but they lack the magical support
of [[Aundair]] or [[Thrane]], which evened the odds during
the [[Last War]]. Nonetheless, Karrns are proud of their
martial history, and most are convinced that they would
have eventually won the Last War.

Karrnath suffered a series of severe food shortages
and plagues early in the Last War. As a result, the king
embraced the Blood of Vol as the national religion. The
priests of this faith bolstered Karrnath's forces with [[undead]], developing the [[Odakyr Rites]] for creating tremendously efficient [[animated soldiers|Karrnathi undead]]. The current king, [[Kaius ir'Wynarn III]], broke ties with the [[Blood of Vol]] and has stopped creating new [[undead]], but Karrnath still has a significant number of skeletons and [[zombie]]s in service. Many Karrns still believe in the Blood of Vol and approve of the use of undead (particularly within the Grand Duchy of [[Atur]]), but just as many feel that this practice disgraces Karrnath's proud military history and that the necromancers might have been responsible for the famines and plagues.

The nation's name has not changed since the ancient days before the founding of the [[Five Nations]], when [[Karrn the Conqueror]] not only established the country that still bears his name but also tried to conquer and unite all of [[Khorvaire]] under his rule. Centuries later it was another [[Karrn|Karrn Wynarn]], one of King [[Galifar|Galifar Wynarn]]'s sons, who rededicated the nation to himself in 32 YK, the same year when the [[Five Nations]] officially adopted the names of Galifar's five eldest children.

!! Interesting Things About {{!!title}}

* [[Rekkenmark Academy]] is the premier military institute in Khorvaire; prior to the Last War, all of [[Galifar]]'s officers trained at Rekkenmark.
* The [[Sovereign Host]] has regained its place as the dominant religion of Karrnath, but the [[Blood of Vol]] retains a strong following. Communities that practice the faith still use skeletons and zombies as guards or laborers.
* The laws of Karrnath are harsher than those in other treaty nations, approaching a state of martial law.

!! Karrnathi Characters

Karrns are somber folk and disapprove of extravagance
or excessive shows of emotion. As you develop a Karrnathi character or NPC, consider the following:

* ''Military Service.'' Karrns have a strong tradition of military service, making [[Distinguished Veteran]] or [[Sailor]] appropriate background talents for such a character. [[Criminal]]s and [[Charlatan]]s have a difficult time evading the harsh laws of Karrnath.
* ''Martial Tradition.'' Karrnathi tradition emphasizes teamwork, focus, and force, and melee warriors prefer heavy armor and weapons. Karrnathi [[wizard]]s choose the School of [[Evocation|evocation]] or [[Necromancy|necromancy]] as their arcane tradition.
* ''The Dead.'' [[Undead soldiers|Karrnathi undead]] have served in Karrnath's armies for decades. How do you feel about the undead? Are you a follower of the [[Blood of Vol]] who considers the undead to be a practical tool? Do you have a relative or friend currently serving? Or do you despise the Blood of Vol and the use of necromancy?

!! Aftermath of the Last War

Karrnath has always been a martial nation, and its
people remain vigilant. Early in the war, King [[Kaius I|Kaius ir'Wynarn I]] instituted the [[Code of Kaius]], a strict set of laws and
limits. Karrnath weathered a number of famines during
the war, and this privation led to an ongoing program of
rationing to ensure that the nation is prepared for whatever lies ahead. The war is over, but the Code of Kaius
and the rationing remains in place; the people of Karrnath willingly endure ongoing hardship to ensure that
their future is secure. The populace frowns on excess of
any sort, accepts limits on luxury items, and approves of
swift and harsh punishments for crime.

King [[Kaius III|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] was one of the architects of the [[Treaty of Thronehold]] and remains committed to peace. However, many of the nation's warlords believe that Karrnath would have won the [[Last War]] and that Kaius denied the Karrnathi people their rightful destiny. Should these warlords gain sufficient support, they could push
for a military coup.

A second destabilizing factor is the tension between
the followers of the [[Blood of Vol]] and the Karrnathi traditionalists. The Seekers assert that the Blood of Vol saved Karrnath and point to the power of its undead
troops. The traditionalists claim that the dark magic
of the Seekers caused famines and plagues, crippling
Karrnath and forcing it to rely on the undead. The Blood
of Vol could back an uprising in Karrnath, or those who
wish to drive out the Seekers could trigger a civil war.

!! Talenta Border Region

The loosely-defined border region between Karrnath and the [[Talenta Plains]] blends the traditions of both cultures. The region has a tumultuous history; before the rise of [[Galifar]], Karrn warlords subjugated nomad tribes, and Talenta raiders struck deep into Karrnath. [[Galifar]] largely brought an end to both extremes, but also established this region as a buffer zone. Some nomad tribes chose to settle in the area, adopting agriculture and swearing fealty to warlords in exchange for protection and support. In the present day, these still exist. These [[kleynam]]s, or "small towns," are communities that are almost entirely comprised of [[halfling]]s, whose people think of themselves as Karrns but still retain some elements of the Talenta faith, speak both [[Common]] and [[Talentan]] in everyday life, and who may domesticate [[fastieth]], [[glidewing]]s, or [[hammertail]]s. 

In the wake of the [[Last War]], [[Karrnath]] has established an alliance with the [[Talenta|Talenta Plains]] clans to curb continued aggression from [[Valenar]] raiding parties. New Talentan families have begun to settle in this border region, and nomadic tribes have shifted their migratory routes to pass through southern Karrnath, taking advantage of the alliance.
