Ethereal [[ooze]]s are extremely rare creatures native to the [[Ethereal Veil]] which prey on creatures of the Material Plane. When visible, they appear as ten-foot-wide, quivering blobs of geometric forms, reminiscent of a cluster of quartz crystals. But most of the time, an ethereal ooze lurks invisibly beyond the [[Ethereal Veil]] like a [[ghost]], using its unique form of [[blindsight]] to detect prey in the physical world. The ooze then manifests, silently moving towards the creature before attempting to engulf it, pull it into the Ethereal Veil, crush it (or suffocate it) to death, and digest it with powerful acid.

An ethereal ooze moves completely silently, and it is immune to poison and all mind-affecting magic. It can pass through most physical objects, but is halted by arcane force effects such as [[walls of force|wall of force]]. When it manifests physically, an ethereal ooze is incorporeal, like a [[spirit]]; as such, it is resistant to physical and elemental [[damage|damage type]], but it is highly susceptible to [[ghost phase weapon]]s. But when an ethereal ooze is encountered in the [[Ethereal Veil]], it is //not// incorporeal, and thus loses its resistance to physical and elemental damage.
