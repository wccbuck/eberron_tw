A quiet trapper and hunter, Adalbar is a lean, sandy-haired fellow, 31 years of age. He lives in [[Dry Rise]], [[Breland]], in the [[Harkenwold]] county.

!! During the [[Reavers of Harkenwold|The Reavers of Harkenwold]] Adventure

[[Dry Rise]] elder Sole Toldorff has no stomach for a fight against the [[Iron Circle]]. Adalbar has taken up the rebels' cause in his stead. The woodsman doesn't say much, but when he does, he speaks his mind and tells the truthâ€”if that gets someone's dander up, so be it.

Adalbar is on good terms with the Cliffwalker [[shifter]]s of the [[Briar Hills]], and thinks they might be willing to help. If Arien hasn't already been tasked with the mission, Adalbar suggests that she try to win the Cliffwalkers' trust.
