While they are devoted to the [[Undying Court]], the\nTolaen Aereni are more invested in perfecting physical crafts\nthan in contemplating metaphysical mysteries. The Tolaen\nalso produce many of Aerenal's soldiers and usually have good\nrelations with the [[Tairnadal]]. Tolaen Aereni prefer simple,\nfunctional clothes with little adornment. Tolaen masks are\nusually made from wood, and may be intricately carved; Tolaen\nsoldiers often wear half-masks covering their lower faces.",
