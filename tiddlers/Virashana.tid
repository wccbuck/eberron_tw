Virashana is a [[kalashtar]] [[soulknife]] from [[Breland]]. She was raised in the [[Path of Light]] and knows its traditions, and she has contacts in the [[Overlook]] district of [[Sharn]]. But generally, she operates alone. She’s what the Path calls a [[shadow watcher|atavist]]—someone who seeks to fight evil directly and forcefully. When she was young, her kalashtar community was targeted by the [[Dreaming Dark]] and her father was killed by an [[Inspired]] assassin. Now Vira craves vengeance, and has devoted her life to identifying and eliminating [[mind seed]]s and other agents of the Dreaming Dark in [[Khorvaire]].

!! Vira as a Quest Giver

//"Good to see you again. What's it been? Five years since that ugly business in the [[Cogs]]? Well, something's up again... something to do with House [[Deneith]]. You and your friends free tonight? Dress for the sewers."//

Virashana could draw adventurers into a story arc about fighting against the [[Dreaming Dark]], starting with a minor scheme where their involvement isn't obvious, which then draws the party deeper into a larger plot. For example, see the quote above; Vira has been conducting a personal investigation, she's identified a threat, and she needs back-up. Vira can share general knowledge about the [[Dreaming Dark]] whenever it becomes relevant, but she has never been to [[Adar]], she's never met a [[Riedran|Riedra]] [[Inspired]], she's not connected to a larger network of [[kalashtar]]... she doesn't have a lot of information, but she's following a lead, and is going to get her hands dirty whether you join in or not.
