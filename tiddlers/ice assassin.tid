Ice assassins are near-perfect duplicates of specific creatures, created using a magical effect similar to the spell [[simulacrum]]. Creating one requires an ice statue of the creature to be duplicated, with some portion of that creature (e.g. a lock of hair or a fingernail) as well as a [[snow sapphire]] encased within. The secret of this magic lies in the strange power of the [[Heart of Winter|Dral Khatuur]].

An ice assassin possesses all of the skills, abilities, and memories possessed by the original creature (with a few exceptions, such as the touch of [[divine magic]]). The duplicate is formed entirely of ice, but it appears as an exact duplicate to all but its original, who (if still living) sees the ice assassin as an animated ice statue of themselves. It also persistently knows the location of its duplicate, as the spell [[locate creature]].

Ice assassins are immune to cold damage, poison, [[disease]], and the effects of age. They do not have to sleep, though they may choose to. They are, however, vulnerable to fire, and cannot recover damage through natural or [[magical healing]]. An assassin destroyed by fire melts into a pool of water; an assassin destroyed by other means explodes in a burst of icy shrapnel. Those who search its remains will find the original creature's remnants and a [[snow sapphire]].
