Smaller than a pair of fingers and adorned with a wildly colorful rainbow shell, the missile shrimp is as gorgeous as it is dangerous. Dwelling in reefs, this aggressive shrimp is able to draw latent magical energies from the area and use it to fire off a [[magic missile]] up to three times per day. The shrimp are completely fearless.
