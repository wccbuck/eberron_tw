Haras Kant is a wealthy [[Brelish|Breland]] [[human]] aristocrat and a member of the [[Aurum]]. Like most members of the Aurum, he is interested in
increasing his personal power and wealth, whatever
the cost. Kant has a special interest in fabulous and
magic gems, and adventurers that obtain unusual
gemstones may attract his interestâ€”which can be a
dangerous thing. 

Kant resides in [[Crystal Bridge]] in [[Upper Northedge]], [[Sharn]].
