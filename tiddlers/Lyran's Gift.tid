The arcane researchers of Lyranâ€™s Gift work with House [[Cannith]] to make better, faster [[elemental galleon]]s and [[airship]]s. At secret laboratories in [[Stormhome]] and on islands in the [[Bitter Sea]], they also test magic catapults and other defensive naval [[arcane artillery]].

The top arcane researchers of Lyran's Gift can be found at the [[Lyrandar]] [[enclave]] in [[Taer Valaestas]].
