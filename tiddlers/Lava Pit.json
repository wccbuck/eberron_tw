        "text": "The Lava Pit is an up-and-coming restaurant in—of\nall places—the [[Cogs]] of [[Sharn]], in the heart of the [[Blackbones]] district. True to its name, the Lava Pit overlooks a gigantic forge powered by molten rock,\nthe glow from which suffuses the place with lurid\nred light. The restaurant began as little more than a\nhole in the wall with an interesting location, serving a\nvariety of grilled meats prepared in the spicy [[Shadow Marches]] style. Its popularity has grown tremendously, allowing the restaurant to improve its facility\nand expand its menu (although the Shadow Marches\ncuisine remains its specialty), making it by far the\nmost upscale establishment of any kind in the [[Cogs]].",
