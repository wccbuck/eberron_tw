The lords of [[Thrane]] still hold Queen [[Wroann|Wroann ir'Wynarn]]
responsible for the [[Last War]], and relations between
the two countries have never been warmâ€”though
this general distaste pales in comparison to the
hatred the people of Thrane have for the [[Karrn|Karrnath]]s.

Lady [[Anador ir'Laisha]] monitors events in the city on behalf of her nation, but rarely becomes actively involved in local affairs.
