        "text": "The [[Mockery]] is the lord of pain and vengeance, the deceiver who destroys. His [[monk]]s embrace suffering; through ritual torture, they overcome weakness of body and mind. As part of this training, a monk flays strips of their skin, treating the muscle below with an alchemical substance that toughens it. Once an initiate has learned to endure pain, they are taught to inflict it. The monks of the Flayed Hand are master torturers and deadly warriors. A monk of the Mockery seeks communion with her god through violence and treachery. Many members of the order sell their services as mercenaries and assassins. Others cause pain in more subtle ways by destroying hopes and dreams instead of spilling blood.",
