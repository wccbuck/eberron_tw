Whenever you fire this ammunition and miss your intended target, the projectile will redirect itself towards a nearby foe, or another foe along your line of sight to the target within range. Mechanically, this means you have -1 [[risk]] for any "reduced impact" [[consequence]]s of [[mixed success]]es whenever you are facing multiple foes.
