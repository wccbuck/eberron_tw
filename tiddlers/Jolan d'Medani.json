Although the other [[Khoravar|half-elf]] [[dragonmarked house]], [[Lyrandar]], holds great power in the city and nation, Medani also holds a special place of influence. Recently, Viceroy Jolan has made close friends with High King [[Shaeras Vadallia]], hoping to ensure that the half-elves of Valenar don't end up becoming tools of Lyrandar ambition. But Viceroy [[Shyralla d'Lyrandar]] sees this maneuvering as a threat, and believes that Jolan will attempt to break her influence over Valenar by any means necessary.",
