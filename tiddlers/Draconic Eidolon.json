However, some aren't\nwilling to take that chance; using an [[eldritch machine]] hidden\ndeep in Argonnessen, the most powerful can perform a ritual\nthat tethers their spirits to a psychic anchor in [[Dal Quor]]. This\nDraconic [[Eidolon|eidolon]], a monument in the [[Ocean of Dreams]], holds\nthe souls of dragons long dead instead of releasing them\nto Dolurrh. The dragons no longer exist physically; like the\n[[Undying Court]], they're a union of spirits, possessing greater\npower together than they would individually. They can't leave\nthe Eidolon, but possess vast knowledgeâ€”secrets of history,\ninsight into the [[Prophecy|Draconic Prophecy]], and knowledge of epic magic. They\nhave much to offer, but what do adventurers have that the\ndreams of dead dragons might want?",
