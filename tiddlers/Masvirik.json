        "text": "Masvirik is an [[overlord]] of the [[Age of Demons]]. He embodies the warmblooded mortal fears of reptiles and venomous vermin; on the other hand, he also embodies reptilian fears of cold and death. His minions include corrupted [[lizardfolk]], [[dragonborn]], [[troglodyte]]s, and [[kobold]]s, along with [[undead]] reptilian creatures and [[fiend]]s who thrive on cold instead of heat.\n\nMasvirik is imprisoned beneath [[Haka'torvhak]]; the [[Poison Dusk]] are his minions, and at the moment he has little influence beyond [[Q'barra]]. His speaker, the [[dragon]] [[Rhashaak]], is also bound in Haka'torvhak; the reptilian [[rakshasa]] [[Zetsash]] represents Rhashaak on the [[Bleak Council]] of [[Ashtakala]].\n\nInformation about Masvirik is extraordinarily scarce.\nEven the [[dragonborn]] of [[Ka'rhashan]] remember little about\nthis ancient [[fiend]], having focused their attention on their\nbattles against the [[Poison Dusk]]. The [[lizardfolk]] are among\nthe only people who know anything about the [[overlord]], and\nso far they haven’t shared this lore with outsiders. \n\n!! The Wardens of the Cold Sun's Prison\n\nIn the [[Age of Demons]], the region now known as [[Q'barra]]\nwas the domain of a [[fiend]]ish [[overlord]] of terrifying power.\nHe drew the light from the sky, and so his slaves called him\nMasvirik, “the Cold Sun,” cousin to [[Tiamat]]. The dreaming priests of the\n[[Masvirik’Uala|Cold Sun Federation]] say that the Cold Sun formed [[kobold]]s and\n[[troglodyte]]s from [[lizardfolk]] stock, creating beasts that were\nmore vulnerable to his power. The existence of these creatures in distant lands calls this into question, but kobolds and troglodytes make up a larger percentage of the [[Poison Dusk]] than any other race.\n\nLike many of the [[overlord]]s, Masvirik’s arrogance was his\nundoing. The [[dragon]]s and [[couatl]] freed the [[lizardfolk]] from\nhis influence, and they rose up against him. In time the Cold Sun was cast down, bound beneath his [[obsidian citadel|Haka'torvhak]], and trapped by the [[Silver Flame]]. The [[couatl]] sacrificed their lives to kindle that flame, but the [[dragon]]s remained.\n\nIn time they dispatched the [[black dragon]] [[Rhashaak]]\nto watch over [[Q'barra]]. He was accompanied by a host of\n[[dragonborn]] soldiers, hand-picked from the legions of the\n[[Light of Siberys]]. These sentinels established garrisons at\nvarious demonic sites across the region. The worst of these\nwas the resting place of Masvirik, which they renamed\n[[Haka'torvhak]]. Rhashaak made his home there, with the\nbest of his soldiers, and there they waited.\n\nFor a thousand years the [[dragonborn]] served with\ndistinction. As their population grew, they spread\nacross the region. Another thousand years passed,\nand the young grew frustrated. They were a race of\nwarriors waiting for a battle that might never come.\nTheir skills were wasted, and the [[dragon]] lord of\n[[Haka'torvhak]] had little interest in their doings. [[Rhashaak]]’s attention was confined to his city and to a spiritual battle no dragonborn could understand.\n\nSo the [[dragonborn]] ventured across the [[Endworld Mountains]] and into the plains that lay beyond. There they encountered a worthy challenge in the Empire of [[Dhakaan]]. Another thousand years passed as the dragonborn carved out their nation in the [[Blade Desert]] and [[Talenta Plains]], the tides of the Goblin Wars waxing and waning. There were great triumphs and terrible defeats. It was a joyful time for a people who thrived in battle. But in building this new empire, they forgot the battle they’d been sent to fight, and this finally came back to haunt them.\n\nIn [[Haka'torvhak]], [[Rhashaak]] had been holding the\nfiend Masvirik at bay through sheer force of will, until\nhe finally faltered. The wards around Haka’torvhak\ntrapped Rhashaak himself. While the fallen guardian\ncouldn’t leave the fortress, the influence of the Cold\nSun spread across the land, and the [[Poison Dusk]] was\nborn. [[Kobold|kobold]]s, [[troglodyte]]s, and the transformed [[dragonborn]] of Haka’torvhak rose up in arms. Across the empire, young dragonborn corrupted by Masvirik’s power turned on their kin. As the empire collapsed,\nthe dragonborn returned to [[Q'barra]] to face the source\nof the curse.\n\nThe [[dragonborn]] fought valiantly, but it wasn’t a\nbattle that could be won with courage or skill at arms\nalone. To this day, the dragonborn themselves don’t\nrealize the true source of their salvation.\n\nThe [[couatl]] that bound Masvirik left a fail-safe in place.\nAs the [[overlord]]’s power grew, a pulse of radiant energy\nflowed across the land, filling Eberron [[dragonshard]]s\nwith the light of the [[Silver Flame]]. This power weakened\nthe influence of Masvirik and the [[Poison Dusk]] and woke\nancient memories in the [[lizardfolk]]. This was the creation\nof the [[dawn shard]]s, and this web of light has kept the darkness at bay for thousands of years. Now House [[Tharashk]] is\nharvesting these shards in record numbers, and Masvirik’s\npower is growing once more.",
