Her tedious nature, lack of focus and discipline,\nand childish petulance have gained her no friends in\nthe courts of [[Riedra]]. Now, she feels she has wasted her\nlife and deserves her exile. She has given up. Only when\n[[Yrnuxi]] assumes Galshani's form does the lady of Mokush\nseem interested in goings on in the town. ",
