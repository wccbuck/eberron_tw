{"created": "20210208033412048", "title": "Boneyard", "text": "At the eastern end of the [[Blade Desert]] in the [[Talenta Plains]], where the [[Ironroot|Ironroot Mountains]] and [[Endworld|Endworld Mountains]] mountain ranges meet, a hidden valley is filled with the skeletons of countless [[dragon]]s. Ancient skulls form hillocks beneath the thin soil, and bones jut from the ground\nlike weathered ivory trees. Whether this place is an\nancient burial ground or the site of a long-forgotten\ndraconic battle remains unknown. [[Halfling|halfling]] legends\nsay that creatures that disturb the remains here draw\nthe attention of living [[dragon]]s. The plainsfolk take\nthese tales seriously, and local tribes such as the [[Tolashcara]] drive off all outsiders foolish enough to approach the site.\n\nThe only regular visitors the Boneyard receives are also the only ones to whom the [[halfling]]s grant unfettered access. [[Dragonborn|dragonborn]] pilgrims from [[Q'barra]] travel for weeks to cross the [[Endworld Mountains]] and\nskirt the desert to visit the site, but their reasons for\ndoing so remain unspoken. Many outside the plains\nwould love to learn what secrets this site holds, and\nthe [[human]]s of [[Q'barra]] have begun to speculate on\nthe plots the [[dragonborn]] might be hatching in this\nancient ossuary.", "modified": "20210727191958745", "tags": "[[Talenta Plains]] ruin", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "article": "the ", "category": "location", "color": "#3B5C0A", "points": "44.806,30.44", "style": "{\"color\": \"#40262D\"}"}
