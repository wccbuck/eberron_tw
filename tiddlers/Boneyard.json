        "text": "At the eastern end of the [[Blade Desert]] in the [[Talenta Plains]], where the [[Ironroot|Ironroot Mountains]] and [[Endworld|Endworld Mountains]] mountain ranges meet, a hidden valley is filled with the skeletons of countless [[dragon]]s. Ancient skulls form hillocks beneath the thin soil, and bones jut from the ground like weathered ivory trees. Whether this place is an ancient burial ground or the site of a [[long-forgotten draconic battle|Forgotten War]] remains unknown. [[Halfling|halfling]] legends say that creatures that disturb the remains here draw the attention of living [[dragon]]s. The plainsfolk take these tales seriously, and local tribes such as the [[Tolashcara]] drive off all outsiders foolish enough to approach the site.\n\nThe only regular visitors the Boneyard receives are also the only ones to whom the [[halfling]]s grant unfettered access. [[Dragonborn|dragonborn]] pilgrims from [[Q'barra]] travel for weeks to cross the [[Endworld Mountains]] and skirt the desert to visit the site, but their reasons for doing so remain unspoken. Many outside the plains would love to learn what secrets this site holds, and the [[human]]s of [[Q'barra]] have begun to speculate on the plots the [[dragonborn]] might be hatching in this ancient ossuary.",
