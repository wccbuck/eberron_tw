        "text": "The Silverstreak Skycoach Rental Company, located in [[Lyrandar Tower]] in [[Central Plateau]], [[Sharn]], operates a fleet of about one hundred [[skycoach]]es, up to half of which are rented out (along with qualified pilots) to single parties for extended periods of time. This service allows a group to have access to a personal skycoach for days or even weeks at a time. The rest hover near the skyways and balconies in search of people who need transportation to other areas within the city. See the <<navAndScrollToHeader \"Wards of Sharn\" \"Travel Time\">> section of [[Wards of Sharn]] for a breakdown of travel costs.\n\n[[Serra Narim]], a classy, red-haired [[human]] woman in her mid-thirties, started this company five years ago and still heads it today.\n\n!! Adventure Hook\n\n* The PCs stumble across a dead body in a less-traveled area. Investigation reveals that the corpse is that of a driver for the Silverstreak Skycoach Rental Company. Even more troubling is the fact that neither the driver nor his coach have been reported missingâ€”in fact, both are still in service.",
