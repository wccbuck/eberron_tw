A tough, wiry [[halfling]], he has multiple contacts in [[Karrnath]], [[New Cyre]], [[Morgrave University]], and House [[Cannith]]. He also keeps a backdoor\nconnection with the [[Emerald Claw]], with whom he is\noccasionally willing to do business—if the price is right.\n\nHamish is constantly attended by two bodyguards—identical twin [[Valenar]] [[elf]] women who owe him a blood debt. The Abode, easily the most impressive structure on the market platform, deals in exotic and masterwork weapons, magic items, artwork, cultural artifacts, and other high-end valuables.",
