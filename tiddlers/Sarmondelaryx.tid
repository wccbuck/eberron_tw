Sarmondelaryx, also known as the Red Wyrm, the Bane of Thrane, the Angel of Flame, and other names, is a [[rogue dragon]] infamous for her rampage across [[Thrane]] and northern [[Cyre]] that claimed the life of Prince [[Thrane|Thrane Wynarn]] and burned down much of the [[Grand Temple of the Host|Daskara]] in 22 YK. 

Sarmondelaryx's rampage, referred to by scholar Bal Thurin as "The Scourge of the Angel of Flame" in his treatise //A Brief History of [[Galifar]],// razed village and castle alike as the [[dragon]] carved a path of destruction through the kingdom. The young Prince [[Thrane Wynarn]] raised an army to face her, and met the dragon on Toran's Field, near the [[Golden Forest|Burnt Wood]]. The prince was slain, the army was scattered, and the Golden Forest was thenceforth known as the Burnt Wood.

The dragon's reign of terror came to an abrupt end when she suddenly vanished a few days after Prince Thrane's ill-fated offensive. She would not be seen again for centuries.

Many scholars say that Sarmondelaryx's rampage, the death of [[Thrane Wynarn]], and the destruction of the Grand Temple of the Host (which took decades to rebuild, and was completely destroyed almost 300 years later by [[Bel Shalor]]'s forces during the [[Year of Blood and Fire|Tira Miron]]) paved the way for the rise of the Church of the [[Silver Flame]]. Prince Thrane was seen before his death as the chosen champion of the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]], and his defeat at the hands of the dragon caused many Thranes to lose faith in the gods.

!! Later Sightings

Though best known as the Bane of [[Thrane|Thrane Wynarn]], Sarmondelaryx has reappeared throughout history since her notorious rampage. Upon revealing herself to the world, she seems to target the greatest individual champion of an age, slay them, and then disappear for decades or centuries, only to appear again and repeat the process. Some stories say that she has made a deal with the [[Keeper]]â€”that she devours the souls of heroes as part of some gruesome pact. Her last recorded appearance was just over two hundred years ago. If she is alive today, then she is a truly ancient and venerable wyrm.
