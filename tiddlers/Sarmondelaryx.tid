In 22 YK, the [[rogue dragon]] Sarmondelaryx, the "Bane of Thrane", began a rampage in the provinces of [[Thrane]] and northern [[Cyre]]. She burned down much of the [[Grand Temple of the Host|Daskara]], which took decades to rebuild. Prince [[Thrane|Thrane Wynarn]] raised an army to face her, but she slayed him and scattered the army. The area devastated in the battle became known as the [[Burnt Wood]]. Sarmondelaryx's reign of terror came to an abrupt end when she suddenly vanished several weeks after Prince Thrane's ill-fated offensive.
