title: Time Is An Illusion
tooltip: universal property: the flow of time is completely unpredictable here, sometimes flows backwards relative to Material Plane
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While on a [[plane]] with this property, time is completely unreliable. Adventurers could be trapped in the plane for what feels like a lifetime, then find only a moment has passed on [[Eberron]]. It's even possible for them to return to Eberron before they left, potentially becoming stranded in another time.
