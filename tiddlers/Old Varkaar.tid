Varkaar is a [[Bloodbound]] of the [[Red Ring]], the Splintered Shieldâ€™s mightiest gladiator, a longtime fighter with plenty of kills on his record. He lost his right eye a few weeks back during a hail of death match, during which spectators can shoot crossbows into the ring as the gladiators fight, and the [[manticore]] now loathes no match more than this type of bout.
