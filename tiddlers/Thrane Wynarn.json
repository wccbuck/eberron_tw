When the Kingdom of [[Galifar]] was formed, the king granted Thrane the role of governor-prince over the domain of [[Daskara]], the area later known as [[Thrane]]. Prince Thrane was seen by the people as an exemplar of the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]] and a chosen champion of [[Dol Arrah]]; he likely possessed some form of [[divine magic]].\n\nPrince Thrane governed the province until his death in 22 YK, when he led an army to stop the rampaging [[dragon]] [[Sarmondelaryx]]. His death was a devastating blow to the faith of the people of [[Thrane]].",
