title: runic ammunition
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Runic ammunition resembles normal bolts, arrows, or sling stones that are etched with runes that make them magically discordant to spellcasters. When a creature concentrating on maintaining a spell or magical effect is hit by a piece of runic ammunition, that creature loses their concentration and the effect ends. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.
