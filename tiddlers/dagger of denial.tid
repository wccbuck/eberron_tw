This silver stiletto blade bears intricate grooves that
spiral from its tip to its ivory hilt and handle. 

You can place the point of the blade
into any keyhole and seal it shut. A keyhole sealed in
this way canâ€™t be unlocked until this dagger is placed
into that keyhole once more (though a sealed door
or container can still be broken, bypassing the lock).
Sealing a keyhole unseals any keyholes previously
sealed with this weapon.
