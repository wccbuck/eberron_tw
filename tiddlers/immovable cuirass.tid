This lightweight cuirass of hardened leather has been imbued with the magic of an [[immovable rod]]. When a small button on the right shoulder is pressed, the armor becomes magically fixed in place. Until the button is pressed again, the armor doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The cuirass can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the cuirass to deactivate and fall.
