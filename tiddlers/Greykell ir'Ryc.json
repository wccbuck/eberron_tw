        "text": "Scion of a noble [[Cyran|Cyre]] family, Greykell ir'Ryc served as a captain in the Queen's Guard of [[Cyre]]. Known as \"the laughing wolf\" due to her tenacity and good humor, Greykell was renowned throughout the southern command for her cunning strategies and her ability to inspire her soldiers. The blood of [[dragon]]s is said to run in her house, and in addition to being a gifted swordswoman, she possesses a minor talent for magic. During her service in the [[Last War]], she was injured on the [[Karrnath]]i front; she lost the use of her right eye, and a maze of fine scars run across the right side of her face.\n\nFollowing the [[destruction|Mourning]] of [[Cyre]], Greykell traveled to [[Sharn]]. She has established herself as the unofficial sheriff of the [[High Walls]] district, though she prefers to maintain order through diplomacy as opposed to the use of force.",
