A crystal theater is an invention of [[House|dragonmarked house]] [[Phiarlan]] as a way for remote viewers to watch live stage performances. A crystal theater is a very large [[crystal ball]] that can be tuned by a wielder of the [[Mark of Shadow]] to one of five different locations where a [[scrying]] anchor called a //scrystone// has been installed (similar to the effect of [[shadow eyes]]). Each of the five locations is a stage located elsewhere in the [[Five Nations]] where House Phiarlan or [[Thuranni]] holds performances. The crystal focus then projects the image onto a screen for easier viewing. This device allows attendees to scry on a distant production in real time, but it does not record images for future viewing.

Before the [[Mourning]], crystal theaters were very popular across [[Cyre]]; they could be found even in small towns.

While today all crystal theaters are connected to stationary scrystones installed at major stages, it is possible that //mobile// scrystones could be in development, allowing crystal theaters to tune in to live on-the-scene news reports, or even the exploits of an adventuring party.
