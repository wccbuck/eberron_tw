title: Actions and Attributes
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Actions and attributes are the basis for all attempts your character performs. They tell you the number of dice you pick up and roll when it's time to take action. They help you answer the question, "What do you do, and what do you use to do it?" When making an attempt, take the relevant [[action]] score, add it to the relevant [[attribute]] score, and roll that many six-sided dice.

The five [[action]]s are verbs: ''Fight, Move, Operate, Study,'' and ''Sway''. They indicate //what you do.// 

The five [[attribute]]s are nouns: ''Focus, Guile, Heart, Intellect,'' and ''Vigor''. They indicate //what you use// when solving problems.

At character creation, distribute the following scores across any of your actions and attributes: 2, 1, 1, 1, 1. An example distribution might look like this:

|!Fight | 1 ||!Focus | 1 |
|!Move | ||!Guile | 2 |
|!Operate | 1 ||!Heart | |
|!Study | ||!Intellect | |
|!Sway | 1 ||!Vigor | |

As your character advances over time, you can add more points to your actions and attributes.
