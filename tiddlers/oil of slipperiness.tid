title: oil of slipperiness
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. It is extremely slippery, a magically-enhanced property that persists for up to eight hours. There is enough oil to cover a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground, or cover a human-sized creature.
