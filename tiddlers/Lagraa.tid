Lagraa is the spiritual counselor of the [[Tharashk Enclave|Tharashk Enclave (Graywall)]] of [[Graywall]]. Her nature is up to the GM, and determines what sort of long-term stories might evolve in the enclave. She might be an [[druid]] of the [[Gatekeepers]], in which case she might call on player characters who are [[Tharashk]] heirs to fight [[aberration]]s and terrors beneath [[Graywall]]. However, she could be an evil priestess of the [[Dragon Below|Cults of the Dragon Below]], slowly spreading her poisonous beliefs throughout the [[enclave]] and calling up horrors from the darkness. If this is the case, the Tharashk enclave could become the hub of an epic adventure as Lagraa and her disciples work to release a [[daelkyr]]!
