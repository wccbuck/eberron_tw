title: Baudry Cartamon
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A shifty, fat scoundrel of a man, his hair slicked back with a quart of whale grease, Baudry Cartamon likes to fancy himself an underworld kingpin, but
he is nothing of the sort. A dishonest merchant, an
amateur smuggler, and an inexperienced thief, Baudry
has delusions of grandeur and can often be found
with kindred spirits in the [[Wayward Lobster]]. Every
feud with another petty criminal he believes to be a
vendetta, every deal he makes is a matter of life and
death. Some get taken in by his act, and he has a gang
of similarly egotistical thugs, as well as the ear of a
few new arrivals who believe his nonsense. So far the
[[Bilge Rats]] have let him live, most likely as a source
of amusement.

Baudry works for the [[Night Tide]] and is interested in purchasing any treasure the PCs bring back from the jungle, but he always tries to hoodwink them.
