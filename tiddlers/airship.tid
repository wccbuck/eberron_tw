The airship is the most advanced [[elemental]]-powered vehicle on [[Eberron]], the pride of House [[Lyrandar]] and the forerunner of the magical advances that many hope will become commonplace in the aftermath of the [[Last War]]. The first airships emerged from the [[Cannith]] and [[Zilargo]] workshops and appeared in House Lyrandar's service just eight years ago (in 990 YK). For now, though, they remain rare, because the [[soarwood]] required for their construction is exceedingly scarce and tightly controlled.

Soarwood is a form of weightless timber found only on
the island of [[Aerenal]], and the [[elves|elf]] who live there limit
their annual harvest of the precious wood. As a result,
production of new airships proceeds at a snail's pace,
unable to satisfy the fervent demand for new vessels.
The discovery of a new supply of soarwood could literally change the world, and even convincing the elves of
Aerenal to part with more of it would be an achievement
worth a handsome reward from House [[Lyrandar]]. 

!! How It Works

A standard airship (at least as far as standards have been defined for this relatively new creation) looks similar to an oceangoing ship but is rigged with control fins and rudders rather than sails. An [[air|air elemental]] or [[fire elemental]] is bound into a ring around the hull, which is suspended on four struts jutting outward. [[Air elemental|air elemental]]s typically provide better lift and maneuverability, while [[fire elemental]]s provide greater thrust; the largest airships often have one of each, in two separate elemental rings. Most airships are outfitted with the finest amenities, including many decorative flourishes and creature comforts.

!!! Operation

A [[dragonmark]]ed heir of House [[Lyrandar]] must pilot a Lyrandar airship, channeling the power of the [[Mark of Storm]] through the [[wheel of wind and water]] that controls the vessel. The helm is typically situated near the rear of the ship, inside the shelter of a wheelhouse. Controlling the vessel (without the benefit of something like the [[conductor stone]]s that dictate a [[lightning rail]] route) requires constant attention, so at least two pilots typically travel on every journey. 

Only a dragonmarked heir with the [[Mark of Storm]] can
use the wheel and command the bound [[elemental]].
House [[Lyrandar]] pilots train for months to gain a deep
understanding of the ship's powers and limitations.
Because of this training, a skilled pilot can execute acrobatic maneuvers in the sky.

During flight, the rest of the crew manages the airship's systems: the ''elemental core'', the heart of the engine, a [[Khyber dragonshard|dragonshard]] encased in brass and [[mithral]]; engraved metal ''veins'' that channel the [[elemental]] to the ring as well as power secondary enchantments; the ''focusing nodes'' that direct the elemental's energy and stabilize the core; the ''wind wards'' that maintain air pressure and maneuver the ship; and other systems.

Airships can move in all three dimensions, with or without the aid of the wind. They are able to fly equally well on their sides or even upside down (notwithstanding the risks
that such maneuvers present to passengers and crew). 

Airships cannot actually land, because the struts that hold the elemental ring in place protrude 10 feet from the bottom of the vessel. Thus, passengers and cargo are lifted in elevators and loaded at towers in major cities (see "Suppression" below). Each ship carries rope ladders for use at smaller stations, in open terrain, or in cases of dire emergency.

A typical airship can reach a speed of 20 miles per
hour in clear skies carrying up to 30 tons of cargo.
Airships are most often employed by explorers and by
wealthy travelers who demand luxuryâ€”clients who
have a need to move quickly to places that might not be
served by the [[lightning rail]]. However, range is limited; traveling too far from a docking station might cause elemental exhaustion on the return trip, causing the focusing nodes and other components of the elemental engine to burn out.

!!! Suppression

Despite the fact that airship hulls are made from magically buoyant [[soarwood]], their non-soarwood parts and cargo result in a heavier-than-air vessel that requires an active elemental ring in order to hover. When an airship lands at a docking tower, the station suppresses or "calms" the [[elemental]], carefully returning it to the engine core as station workers use ropes to maneuver the airship into position.
