This ammunition (arrow, crossbow bolt, etc.) is etched with images of wings, and is favored by long-range hunters and snipers. When you shoot at a target using this ammunition, you do not suffer [[disadvantage]] or reduced [[impact]] when your target is hiding behind partial cover, or when your target is at the far end of your weapon's maximum range.
