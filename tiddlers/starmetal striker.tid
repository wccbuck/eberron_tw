This one-handed hammer was forged from a mysterious metal gathered from the [[Astral Sea]], and is cold to the touch. The hammer does additional cold damage to any target it strikes. The hammer leaves behind a crackling mist when it is thrown, and immediately flies back to your hand after striking or missing its target.
