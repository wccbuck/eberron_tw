The Hazals made\ntheir fortune investing in the smelting industry, and Hazal caravans still bring in ore from the family's northern holdings on a regular basis. But while the Hazals have always been community leaders, they have also been religious leaders. Beyond a façade large enough to entertain guests and outsiders, the house of Hazal holds [[Sharn]]'s only temple to the [[Blood of Vol]]. Every [[Zol|Khorvaire calendar]] the\nfaithful come in shifts to give blood and hear the word\nof Vol. During the holiest days—such as the Tanarath,\nwhen the moon [[Aryth]] is eclipsed by [[Sypheros]]—almost\nall of the faithful gather at once.\n\nThe current master of the house and priest of\nthe Blood is [[Lan Hazal]]. Lan's wife died recently, and\nthere is a great deal of interest in the community as\nto who might become the next Lady Hazal. \n\nThe house of Hazal also contains the stores of blood\ndonated by the members of the church, which are used\nto sustain Lady [[Tarra'az|Jesel Tarra'az]] and visiting [[vampire]]s.
