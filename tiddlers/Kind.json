He directly reports to the [[Minister of the Dead|Ministry of the Dead]], Count [[Vedim ir'Omik]]. The Kind is an old man with long gray hair who wears the simple black uniform\nand silver raven pin of the Collectors. He remains vigorous despite his age, but he never raises his voice or\nshows any sign of anger, and is a devoted [[Seeker|Blood of Vol]]. He isn't especially skilled a combat magic, but he is one of the finest [[necromantic|necromancy]]\nritualists of the modern age.\n\nThe [[Kind]] fears that the [[Karrnathi undead]] aren't animated by the patriotic soul of\n[[Karrnath]], but rather by an aspect of [[Mabar]] itselfâ€”that\nthe combat styles of the undead might be those of\nthe [[dark fiend|yugoloth]]s of Mabar. Over the years, he has felt\na certain malevolence in his skeletal creations that he\ncan't explain, not to mention their love of slaughter.\nHe has also considered the possibility that they are\ntouched by the spirits of the [[Qabalrin]] [[elves|elf]] of ancient [[Xen'drik]]. The Kind hasn't found any proof for these\ntheories, but they haunt his dreams.",
