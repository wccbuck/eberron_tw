A thoqqua is an [[elemental]] creature native to [[Fernia]]. Also known as a "fireworm", this segmented wormlike creature is typically 1 foot in diameter and 4 to 5 feet long, and weighs about 200 pounds. A thoqqua's body generates incredible heat, which constantly hisses from the joints between its spiny protective plates. Its beak glows orange-white and is hot enough to melt solid rock, which it uses to burrow molten tunnels through the [[Deep Halls]].
