Moonspeaker druids respect the totems\nassociated with the beast within—Grandmother Wolf, Cousin\nBear—but they don't see these spirits as gods. These beasts\nguide shifters from within—they don't shape the world itself.\n\nThese totem spirits may share a connection with the totems of [[Lamannia]].",
