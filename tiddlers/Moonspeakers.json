Moonspeaker druids respect the totems\nassociated with the [[beast]] within—Grandmother Wolf, Cousin\nBear—but they don't see these spirits as gods. These beasts\nguide shifters from within—they don't shape the world itself. These totem spirits may share a connection with the totems of [[Lamannia]].\n\nThe Moonspeakers hold a valuable role among many [[Eldeen|Eldeen Reaches]] [[shifter]]s: Because they often travel from one shifter settlement to another, they maintain the bond between the distant and fragmented communities.",
