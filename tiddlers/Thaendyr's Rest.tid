type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A large [[densewood]] building lies near the wall between the [[Harbor]] district and the [[Graystone]] ward. A leafy [[livewood]]
sign bears the image of a golden mask above a fountain,
along with the name Thaendyr’s Rest.

Combining the functions of consulate, inn, and temple, Thaendyr's Rest is a little piece of [[Aerenal]] in [[Stormreach]]. Located near the wall between the [[Harbor]] district and the [[Graystone]] ward, the Rest caters to [[Aereni]] and their companions and is run by the [[elf]] [[Thaera]]. [[Maeran Mendyrian]] is the resident [[Undying Court]] priest and de facto consul.

Under normal circumstances, only [[Aereni]] (and
their companions) are allowed into Thaendyr’s Rest.
This policy is enforced by the inn’s [[deathless]] guardian, [[Chyn Mendyrian]].

!! Adventure Hooks

* One of the [[Skullborn]] wants to decipher the methods being used to preserve [[Chyn|Chyn Mendyrian]] while he’s so far from Aerenal. The guardian of the Rest is kidnapped, and Maeran charges an Aereni adventurer to find the honored ancestor before his life force can be corrupted.
* [[Thaera]] approaches the adventurers when they are planning an expedition. The area they plan to pass through has an important role in the history of the [[line|Aereni noble line]] of Daelys, and she wishes to send Chyn with them to search for family relics.
* [[Maeran Mendyrian]] calls an [[Aereni]] adventurer to the Rest. It seems that the [[Shrouds]] are indeed the vanguard of an [[undead]] army lurking beneath the surface, and after decades of work, they are on the verge of completing an [[eldritch machine]]. There’s no time for Maeran to summon the [[Deathguard]], and the machine cannot be allowed to activate or to fall into untrustworthy hands. Can the adventurers defeat these ancient ghosts?
