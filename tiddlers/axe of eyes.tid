type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Both blades of this battleaxe are inscribed with eyelike patterns. While you hold the axe, it lets you see in all directions around it, and you have [[advantage]] when you use sight to perceive your surroundings. The eyes on the axe can't be closed or averted; a bright light source within a few feet of you may cause you to be temporarily blinded.
