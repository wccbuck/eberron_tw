A zombie "clot" is a horde of [[zombie]]s which has been crushed, stitched, or otherwise fused together into a single, rotting titan. The clot acts as one giant-sized entity, flinging its massive corpse-clump arms at its targets. A zombie clot can even fling pieces of itself as far as 30 feet away, surrounding a hapless creature with a jumble of zombies that quickly latch on with their hands and teeth.
