A specter is the angry, unfettered spirit of a [[humanoid]] that has been prevented from passing to [[Dolurrh]]. Specters no longer possess connections to who or what they were, yet are condemned to walk the world forever. Some are spawned when dark magic or the touch of a [[wraith]] rips a soul from a living body.

//''Dwellers in Darkness.''// Sunlight represents a source of life that no specter can ever hope to douse, and it pains them. When night falls, they leave their final resting places in search of living creatures to slay, knowing that few weapons can harm them in return. At the first light of dawn, they retreat back into the darkness, where they remain until night falls again.
