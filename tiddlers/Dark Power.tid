The mightiest and most malevolent beings in [[Mabar]] are
known as the Dark Powers. Each embodies a particular
aspect of Mabar and rules a domain of linked [[layer]]s. Some
have been part of Mabar since the beginning of time, while
others have risen from the fragments consumed by the
Endless Night. Most of the Dark Powers are equivalent in
power to [[archfey]] or [[archfiend|overlord]]s, though they're even stronger
in the layer they're bound to, their seat of power. However,
they have a limited ability to act beyond Mabar, and can
only affect the Material Plane through [[warlock]]s or [[undead]]
servants.

!! The Dark Powers

These are the Dark Powers that are known on [[Eberron]], but there are many more in the shadows.
