//“The exiles forgot their past and this place almost from the moment they stepped onto the boats, so desperate were they to burn away the horrors of what lay behind them. Or perhaps they sensed the greatness of their future and sought to leave space for that in the memory-yet-to-come of their race. Few care to know these things now, but they remain with me. If you have time to listen, I have time to speak...”//
<div align="right">—Qataakhast the Bright-Eyed</div>

In the glowing steppes and harsh desert wastes of
[[Syrkarn]], tales are told of an ageless [[dragon]] whose molten
gaze has seen this land’s fall and rise. He is Qataakhast
the Bright-Eyed, a great [[brass wyrm|brass dragon]] who
can be sighted in the sands and empty grasslands from the central Plains of [[Itzaina|Khunan]] to the sea.

Qataakhast is the keeper of many secrets, but the one he holds closest is known only to him and his apprentice Rumura. Though the [[dragon]]s of [[Argonnessen]] had always been cognizant of the role [[human]] history would one day play in the [[Draconic Prophecy]], few could have foretold how far that history would advance as a result of a single fateful sea voyage. Three thousand years ago, a ragtag flotilla of ships set out from the shores of [[Rhiavhaar]], bound for an unknown land across the [[Sea of Rage]]. The captain of this expedition was [[Lhazaar]]. Qataakhast was there to watch her go.

As a young adult, Qataakhast and his mate [[Vyssilthar]] left [[Argonnessen]] to
take up a life of exile in [[Sarlona]]—punishment for Qataakhast’s failure at a mission of which he has not spoken in all the time since. When the [[Lhazaar]] expedition set
sail, Vyssilthar felt compelled to accompany it in [[half-elf]] form. Qataakhast stayed behind, bound to complete his penance alone.

Before her departure, [[Vyssilthar]] had spent long
years studying the [[Draconic Prophecy]]. When [[Lhazaar]]’s
port city was abandoned in the [[Sundering]], Qataakhast
returned there to record his mate’s work and his own
memories of the expedition, even as he kept watch on
the open sea in the hope that she might someday return.
However, as [[Riedra]] established its dominion over [[Rhiavhaar]], Qataakhast was forced to flee for the freedom of [[Syrkarn]], where he remains today.

Though his former life and calling are some thirty centuries behind him, Qataakhast has lost none of the nobility and sense of purpose that mark many of the great wyrms of [[Argonnessen]]. Today, he spends much of his time traveling across his adopted homeland, forcing lesser [[rogue dragon]]s to respect the settlements of [[human]] and [[eneko]]. On rare occasions, Qataakhast has unleashed his full fury to keep local rogues in line. For most, a single demonstration is all that’s needed.

!! Description

Centuries beneath the bleaching [[Syrkarn]] sun have burnished Qataakhast’s scales
to an almost mirrorlike sheen. His bladed chinhorns are the length of longswords, each honed to razor sharpness by constant rubbing against the shard pile within his lair. Years of slumber on a bed of [[Khyber shard|dragonshard]]s have left the scales of Qataakhast’s underbelly limned a deep blue-black, and a faint glow seems to ripple there as he moves. The deep green of his wing-edges appears nearly pearl-black when they are unfurled, and the great wyrm’s eyes burn with the light of a [[Syrkarn]] dawn.

Like all [[brass dragon]]s, Qataakhast loves the heat, and he often basks in the open sand and empty grasslands of his adopted home. However, because of his imposing physical presence, the great wyrm makes a point of flying only at night if possible. Qataakhast soars with a speed and grace that defy his massive size, and when his gleaming scales catch the dawn’s light, they flare like a beacon that can be seen for miles. The [[eneko]] nomads of the plains consider it good luck to catch sight of this “dragonlight.”

Though he conveys the majesty of distant [[Argonnessen]] in his every word, the great wyrm retains the verbosity and playful acquisitiveness common among his kind. He is great lover of gifts, no matter how trifling, and to those who offer some trinket and the necessary respect, Qataakhast will happily speak for days on end. Those who come to him with specific questions inevitably receive answers, but the great wyrm is seldom in a hurry to get to the point.

For a thousand years, Qataakhast has watched over this land, always hopeful that [[Vyssilthar]] might one day return to his side before he takes his last sight of earth and sky. Lately, however, the great [[dragon]] has become resigned to facing his end alone. The idea that his knowledge will die with him when he passes saddens Qataakhast, and so he seeks to pass on what he knows in the time that remains.
