Superstition holds that there is a far greater chance of being struck by lightning when Zarantyr is full, and that bolts can fall from a clear sky. According to some [[druid]]s, those born in the month of Zarantyr have a wild and tempestuous nature. Sometimes this translates to aggression, but it can also manifest as pure, unbridled energy; [[barbarian]]s and [[sorcerer]]s may feel a bond with the Storm moon.",
