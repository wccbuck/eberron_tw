        "text": "No matter where one stands in [[Flamekeep]], the Grand Cathedral of the [[Silver Flame]] is visible. Situated at the highest point of the city, the massive cathedral sports alabaster walls and flying buttresses fitted with brilliant stained glass\nwindows depicting religious and historical scenes.\nIcons, angelic beings, and gargoyles decorate the\nexterior.\n\nInside, the walls are black marble inlaid with silver patterns, testifying to the church’s wealth and power. The nave can hold thousands at a time, with pews spreading out among the supporting pillars, each of the four transepts, and balconies hanging just\nbelow the clerestory. A raised area before the presbytery can hold a choir of one thousand children, each selected for their ringing voice.\n\nBeyond the presbytery, behind two enormous wooden doors, is the Chamber of the Flame. This place is where the holy light of the [[Silver Flame]] beams and where the [[Keeper of the Flame]] comes to commune with the [[Voice of the Flame|Tira Miron]] upon the mosaic encircling the fiery pool. This font is not a burning pyre, and does not require fuel nor generate heat, as it is a manifestation of the radiant force itself.\n\nThe cathedral also has cloisters in the rock below. Labyrinthine passages lead to cells where high-ranking priests attending the cathedral live, pray, and reflect on their devotion. The lower levels also contain the offices of the [[Council of Cardinals]], a garrison for the church’s divine warriors, and the [[Keeper of the Flame]]’s personal apartments.",
