This wooden quiver can carry your arrows as well as provide some of its own. The quiver grows <<dr 1d3+1>> arrows each day, up to a maximum of four. The grown arrows are thorned, and remain attached to the quiver until picked for use. These magic arrows are powerful and strike true. A grown arrow is no longer magical after 1 minute has passed since it was first picked from the quiver.

When you fire one of these magic arrows, you may speak the quiver's command word to transform the arrow into a thick field of thorns, as the effects of the [[spike growth]] spell, centered on the location the arrow strikes. If the arrow was lodged in a target when you use this ability, that target suffers devastating damage as the spikes emerge from the point of impact.
