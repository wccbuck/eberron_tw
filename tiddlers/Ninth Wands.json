        "text": "''Leaders:'' The [[Dragonhawk]], [[Jorian Thiel]]<br/>\n''Notable Members:'' Blackwind Beleth ([[human]] [[wizard]]), Tyrnan Thiel ([[human]] [[eldritch knight]])<br/>\n''Base of Operations:'' [[Whitewash]]\n\n[[Aundair]] has long been the seat of the [[Arcane Congress]] and the focal point for mystical research within\n[[Galifar]]. Aundair is the smallest of the [[Five Nations]]\nand lacks the industrial resources of [[Karrnath]] or\n[[Breland]]. During the [[Last War]], the nation relied on\n[[arcane magic]] to offset these limitations.\n\nAs the war continued, King [[Aarott|Aarott ir'Wynarn]] charged [[Arcanix]] to produce more efficient weapons of war. The\nmages assigned to the //Seven Stones// project delved into\nthe techniques of the [[daelkyr]], the magic of the [[Age of Demons]], and [[eldritch machine]]s in the quest to end the\nwar. Their achievements were terrifying. Even [[Aundair]]ians grew fearful of [[Arcanix]], and young [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]] was\nhorrified when she learned that her own [[wizard]]s were\nactively seeking to produce even deadlier effects. When\n[[Breland]] demanded the execution of the Seven Stones\nmages as a condition for alliance, Aurala agreed, creating a rift between throne and tower that remains to this day. Brelish envoys witnessed the executions of the\nseven wizards. That should have been the end of it.\n\nAt the end of the [[Last War]], [[Aundair]] released a\nnumber of its soldiers from service. Most dispersed to\ntheir families, but one elite infantry unit—the Queen’s\nNinth Wands—traveled to [[Stormreach]]. Over the course\nof the past two years, they have fought off gangs and\ncriminals that threatened the people of [[Whitewash]], dealt\nwith drunken adventurers, and clashed with the [[Knights of Thrane]] and the [[Swords of Karrn]]. To all appearances,\nthe Ninth Wands are [[Aundair]]ian patriots with no interest in peace, soldiers who traveled to [[Stormreach]] so they\ncould continue fighting the war.\n\nThe truth is more complicated. The Ninth Wands\nare still serving [[Aundair]]—or, more specifically, Royal\nMinister of Magic [[Adal ir'Wynarn]]. See the [[Dragonhawk]] for more information.\n\nThe Ninth Wands are an elite military unit of [[wandslinger]]s. The members know each other well and have developed group tactics. The group’s greatest firepower is in the\nhands of its commander, [[Jorian Thiel]].",
