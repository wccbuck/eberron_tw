This silver weapon (typically an axe) can temporarily bind an incorporeal creature, such as a [[spirit]], to its corporeal form. When an incorporeal creature is hit with this weapon, they suffer additional arcane force damage, and the creature is made tangible and unable to phase through solid objects or creatures for 5 to 10 seconds.
