This silver weapon (typically an axe) can temporarily bind an incorporeal creature, such as a [[spirit]], to its corporeal form. When an incorporeal creature is hit with this weapon, they suffer additional [[force damage|damage type]], and the creature is made tangible and unable to phase through solid objects or creatures for 5 to 10 seconds.
