Much of the work in\nthe Winding Root is wooden sculpture, but the gallery also sells tapestries, jewelry, and even clothing.\nThe goods sold at the Winding Root are of the highest\nquality, often representing years or even decades of\nwork, and the prices reflect their perfection. When\nsomeone needs to find a gown or suit to wear to the\n[[Brelish|Breland]] Court, the Winding Root is a great place to\nvisitâ€”but the prices keep the gallery out of reach of\nall but the wealthiest citizens of [[Sharn]].\n\nIf someone wants to sell her work in the Winding Root, she must speak to the owner, Jhaia Thesaelia. Jhaia is only interested in the work of elven artisans, and items must have been produced with an extremely high degree of craftsmanship. ",
