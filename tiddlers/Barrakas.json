This \"sister moon\" of [[Therendor]] shares a similar (if wider) orbit and occasionally seems to hide behind her closer brother. On nights when Therendor eclipses Barrakas—\"when Barrakas is shy\"—sailors worry about getting lost at sea. Those born when Barrakas is ascendant are thought to be gifted hunters, but many also believe they have a knack for clarifying things that others find confusing. The son of [[Lharvion]] sees what others cannot see, while the daughter of Barrakas sheds light on that which is already in the open.",
