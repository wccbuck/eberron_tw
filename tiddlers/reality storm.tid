Ask anyone on [[Sarlona]] about the vast open spaces of the
[[Tashana Tundra]], and you're likely to hear the same refrain—it is a land
of strange weathers. The native [[shifter]] tribes can tell you more
specifically: The Tundra is home to //aukaraks// or reality storms.

//Aukaraks// are actually free-floating planar breaches, remnants of a long-ago era in which terrible magics rent the very fabric of the planes. They move about the Tundra, blowing in just as a rainstorm might, and blowing over again just as quickly. Reality storms usually function as small, temporary [[manifest zone]]s to one of the twelve [[plane]]s that have coterminous phases with Eberron. They tend to be more intense and powerful than typical manifest zones, but they are unpredictable and impermanent. Reality storms also have a chance of "porting in" natives of a particular [[plane]], as if summoned—these creatures are effectively unsummoned at the end of the storm's duration, and return to their native plane. Finally, some aukaraks simply produce bizarre, random effects that have no apparent connection to any individual plane. Consult the table below for descriptions and effects.

A reality storm takes a few minutes to fully manifest, sometimes simply materializing overhead, sometimes rolling over the horizon and toward the characters. The duration of an aukarak is between 1 and 7 hours, with exceptions for burst storms. Encountered aukaraks can be chosen from the table or randomly rolled.
