A new edition of the Inquisitive appears every Sul (the first day of the week) and is distributed through the city mail. Its publisher,\n[[Haftak ir'Clarn|Haftak's Books and Binding]], is a distant cousin of Lord [[Ruken ir'Clarn]], a member of Breland's [[parliament|Breland Parliament]] who often\nexpresses viewpoints and opinions in opposition to\nKing [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]]. Haftak's position on his cousin's radical politics is the subject of much debate: You can\nfind critics who claim that the //Inquisitive// goes out of\nits way to support the Brelish crown, and others who\nmaintain that the //Inquisitive// is a staunch opponent of\nthe crown.\n\nReaders turn to the Inquisitive for local news (which\nsome say reads more like gossip), for the wisdom of [[Beggar Dane]], and for the opinion\npages, which feature heated debates on important city\nissues. For news from beyond [[Sharn]], educated citizens\nrely on the [[Korranberg Chronicle]].\n\n!! Sharn Inquisitive Issues\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[document]sort[date]]\">>",
