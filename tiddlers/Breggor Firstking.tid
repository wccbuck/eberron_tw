Breggor Firstking was the charismatic ruler who established the pre-[[Galifar]] kingdom of [[Wroat]] nearly 2200 years ago. He famously laid siege to [[Malleon the Reaver]]'s rebuilt city of [[Shaarat|Ja'shaarat]] for almost a year before laying claim to the ruins; his wife [[Raela Solaen]], also known as the Queen of the Burning Sky, was instrumental to his success. He renamed the city ''Dorasharn''; [[Galifar Wynarn]] would later rename it [[Sharn]]. Over the next six hundred and forty years, the towers rose and the city grew, becoming the second jewel in the nation of [[Wroat]]'s crown.
