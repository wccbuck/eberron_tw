Breggor Firstking was the charismatic ruler who established the pre-[[Galifar]] kingdom of [[Wroat]] nearly 2200 years ago, uniting the region by force. He famously laid siege to [[Malleon the Reaver]]'s rebuilt city of [[Shaarat|Ja'shaarat]] for almost a year before laying claim to the ruins; his wife [[Raela Solaen]], also known as the Queen of the Burning Sky, was instrumental to his success. He renamed the city ''Dorasharn''; [[Galifar Wynarn]] would later rename it [[Sharn]]. Over the next six hundred and forty years, the towers rose and the city grew, becoming the second jewel in the nation of [[Wroat]]'s crown.

After Breggor's death, the his successors were unpopular despots, and ultimately they were overthrown and driven from power. The Firstking's crown is lost to history, and his descendants are widely believed to have been wiped out.
