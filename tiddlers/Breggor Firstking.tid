Breggor Firstking was the charismatic ruler who established the pre-[[Galifar]] kingdom of [[Wroat]] 2400 years ago. He famously laid siege to [[Malleon the Reaver]]'s rebuilt city of Shaarat for almost a year before laying claim to the ruins, renaming the city [[Sharn]]. Over the next eight hundred years, the towers rose and the city grew, becoming the second jewel in the nation of [[Wroat]]'s crown.
