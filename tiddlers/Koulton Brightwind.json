Born Koulton d'[[Lyrandar]], this gifted heir and bearer of the [[Mark of Storm]] fled his family in an [[elemental galleon]] twenty years ago, and has so far managed to evade the houseâ€™s efforts to retrieve the ship. Eight years ago, he also commandeered a Lyrandar [[airship]]. House [[Lyrandar]] has put a price on his head, but Prince Brightwind has made arrangements with House [[Thuranni]], and so far his head remains attached to his shoulders.",
