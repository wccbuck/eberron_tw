type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki
var: acid, force

A beam of crackling blue energy lances out toward a creature within 30 feet, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. If the bolt strikes the target, the creature continually suffers [[lightning damage|damage type]] for as long as you are able to sustain the arcâ€”up to 1 minute, or until your concentration breaks, or the creature moves out of range or behind cover.
