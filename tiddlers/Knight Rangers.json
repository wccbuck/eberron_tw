        "text": "The Knight Rangers (also known as the \"Breland Rangers\") are a subdivision of the [[King's Shields]] that patrol the borders of [[Breland]]. Despite technically being under the umbrella of the [[King's Citadel]], the Rangers are an irregular force, with less structure and discipline than other divisions in the military. They operate in small mobile squads and are tasked with dealing with bandits, smugglers, and raiders. As for //how// they deal with such forces, the Rangers' marching orders vary greatly; sometimes they're willing to let smugglers go on their way in exchange for a few casks of rotgut.\n\nThe Knight Rangers patrol the [[King's Forest]] and frequently clash with the [[Jungle Boys]]. Four units of Rangers are assigned to the floating fortress [[Argonth]], including ''Bara's Breakers'', led by [[Big Bara]].",
