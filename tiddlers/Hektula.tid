Hektula is the //prakhutu// (speaker) of the [[overlord]] [[Sul Khatesh]]. She calls herself “The First Scribe,” though her enemies called her “The Bloody Scribe” due to her penchant for using the blood of [[dragon]]s to write her spells. As the librarian of [[Ashtakala]], she organizes and studies the thousands of scrolls and prophecies in its vaults, recording history and researching new spells gleaned from the whispers of her mistress. While she wishes to free the Keeper of Secrets, she primarily acts through alliances with others. She serves as a facilitator who provides the other [[rakshasa]]s of the [[Lords of Dust]] with the knowledge they need to accomplish their goals—in exchange for assistance towards her own goals.
