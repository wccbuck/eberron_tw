Newspapers are the primary avenue for distributing news throughout [[Khorvaire]]. The simplest chronicles appear as scrolls nailed to
public message boards containing the pertinent news
of the week. More ambitious chronicles—including the
[[Aundair]]ian Scroll, the [[Breland]] Ledger, and the [[Sharn Inquisitive]]—are presented as folded broadsheets nested together to form simple books. By far Khorvaire's best known and most widely read newspaper is the [[Korranberg Chronicle]].

Printing presses in the world of Eberron use a [[magic item]] known as a "scrivening drum" to copy pages of text, with the help of a "[[fabrication|fabricate]] engine" to convert an entire tree into reams of paper. Larger newspapers keep a bearer of the [[Mark of Making]] and of the [[Mark of Scribing]] on staff in order to ensure the printing process goes smoothly.

!! Categories of Newspaper

Besides the well-respected [[Korranberg Chronicle]], other
newspapers in [[Khorvaire]] can be grouped into a few dif­ferent categories:

* ''Local Rags.'' Small papers such as the [[Vathirond]] Jour­nal, the [[Vedykar]] Sentinel, and the Write of [[Passage]] are limited in circulation to their own home city, and their coverage is similarly limited in perspective.
* ''Mainstream Media.'' The [[Breland]] Ledger, the [[Sharn Inquisitive]], the [[Aundair]]ian Scroll, and papers like them present generally balanced coverage of world events. They are usually a little slanted in favor of their home nations.
* ''Propaganda.'' Some newspapers, such as the Voice of [[Breland]] and [[similar papers in other nations|Five Voices]], print fiercely partisan news that seems designed to fan the flames of resentment that linger after the [[Last War]].

!! Newspaper as Group Patron

Newspapers employ a wide range of adventurers to bring news back to the home office. Your group might comprise a team of ace reporters working
for a chronicle. You might be under contract to provide the paper
with tales of your exploits as you search out adventure.
Or you might be investigative reporters dedicated to
shining the light of truth into the darkness of criminal,
political, and religious corruption. You might have an
unflinching commitment to the truth, or be more inter­ested in selling papers—or you might be in conflict with the chronicle's management over priorities.
