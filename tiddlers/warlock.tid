type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies
hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts
made with mysterious beings of supernatural power,
warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and
spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of
beings such as [[archfey]], [[overlord]]s, [[daelkyr]], the [[Undying Court]], or powerful [[immortal]] spirits from other [[plane]]s, warlocks piece together
arcane secrets to bolster their own power. 

The magic warlocks cast is considered [[arcane|arcane magic]], due to the predictable and orderly nature of a pact. However, the line is blurred when making a pact with a [[celestial]] or [[fiend]], which may add a dash of faith-based [[divine magic]] into their spellcasting; or making a pact with a [[quori]], which might be considered [[psionic|psionics]] in nature.
