        "text": "The Fangs of Argarak are an enormous mountain range in central [[Xen'drik]], featuring some of the highest peaks in the world. Strange beelike elves can be found in the foothills of these mountains, while the [[minotaur]]-like [[yikaria]] dwell in the highest peaks. In between, the [[Sulatar]] firebinders dwell near [[volcanic fields]] and in ruined [[blood glass]] fortresses of their former [[masters|Sulat League]].\n\nLegend has it that the great [[gold dragon]] Orstyx lairs somewhere in the western wall of the Fangs of Argarak. According to ancient fables, Orstyx's fiery belly is hot enough to destroy any item he swallows.",
