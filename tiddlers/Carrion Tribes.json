Many of them are the descendants of settlers who crossed the sea from [[Sarlona]], but more have arrived by shipwreck or [[demiplane]] in the centuries since. Long years in proximity to the evil suffusing this land have left them corrupted—altered in body and mind to become the savage servants of the ancient [[overlord]]s. The Carrion Tribes lead nomadic lives, hunting and preying on each other in a state of perpetual warfare. Resources are scarce, and many tribes have turned to cannibalism to survive. Many tribes practice ritual scarring and mutilation along with varieties of [[cosmetic transmutation]] to give themselves [[fiend]]ish features.\n\nThe tribes often clash with outposts of [[dragonmarked house]]s as well as the [[Ghaash'kala]] of the [[Labyrinth]]. In fact, the name \"Carrion Tribes\" was coined by the Ghaash'kala, since they see the corrupted humanoids of the wastes as //walking carrion//—they are already dead, and it is a mercy to kill them. Since most knowledge of the [[Demon Wastes]] among [[Five Nations]] scholars has come from interaction with the Ghaash'kala, scholars have adopted this term. But there is no unified culture connecting the disparate tribes; the [[Moon Reavers]] and the [[Plaguebearers]] are bitter and deadly rivals and feel no kinship with each other.\n\n!! Trapped in the Wastes\n\nAn outsider might ask the question, \"Why do the Carrion Tribes revere fiends? Don't they know the [[overlord]]s are evil?\" But members of Carrion Tribes have never known anything that //isn't// evil. They cannot choose between a peaceful life and a fiend-worshiping war; their primary motivation has always been survival. The Carrion Tribes believe that placating their overlord is the only thing that will allow them to survive in this deadly environment, and protect them from the //other// Carrion Tribes. They can't leave the Wastes; the terrifying Ghaash'kala will cut down anyone who approaches the [[Labyrinth]], and the [[demiplane]]s below are even more deadly than the blasted wasteland. In addition, most of the Carrion Tribes are illiterate, and history is only preserved in living memory. So, born into a world in which a fiendish patron is all that stands between life and death, the tribes stake their claim in a particular region of the [[Demon Wastes]], and make peace with the powers that dwell there.\n\n!! Carrion Tribes\n\nListed below are some of the Carrion Tribes that exist today. They rise and fall over the centuries; for example, the current incarnation of the [[Plaguebearers]] have been around for less than a century, only the latest of many vassal tribes of [[Ashurak]] throughout history.\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}sort[relevance]]\">>",
