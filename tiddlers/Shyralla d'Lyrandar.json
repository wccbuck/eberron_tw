As House Lyrandar has been granted near-complete control over civil administration of the nation by the [[Valaes Tairn]], Viceroy Shyralla is essentially acting prime minister of Valenar. She oversees taxation, assistance, justice, agriculture, and many other areas of governance, and she governs well; Shyralla has done well for her people and maintained the trust of the Valaes Tairn. The viceoroy can often be seen seated alongside High King [[Shaeras Vadallia]] himself at dinners at the Darkwood Palace.\n\nShyralla has an ongoing feud with Viceroy [[Jolan d'Medani]], who she believes is attempting to outmaneuver her for the favor of the [[High King|Shaeras Vadallia]].",
