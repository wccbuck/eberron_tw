Out of the pages of the [[Sharn Inquisitive]], the simple lessons for living popularized by this anonymous street [[bard]] have become ingrained in the [[Brelish|Breland]] mindset. These include: “A copper piece in the cup is a copper piece earned,” “Never borrow, never lend,” “The silent man has no one to blame but himself,” and “A [[magewright]] in the town is worth an army in the wilderness.”
