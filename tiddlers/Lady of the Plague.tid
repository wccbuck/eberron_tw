//She grew up in village in [[Daskara]], not far from the modern [[Thrane]] city of [[Sigilstar]]. She loved the country and taking care of the livestock. When she was 13, her family fell ill with a [[disease]] no one had ever seen before. They died, and the plague spread to the rest of the village and their stock. Only two things were unaffected: the rats and the girl. When everyone was dead, she fled to the town of Sarus. You've never heard of Sarus, because it doesn't exist anymore. It was burnt by those who sought to keep the plague from spreading. The rats kept the girl alive, and were the only thing that kept her close to sane. In time she learned to control her power. Even so, she couldn't bear the burden of the deaths on her conscience. She declared that the girl had died with her family. She was someone new, someone without a name. She was the Lady of the Plague.//

The Lady of the Plague was a mysterious figure who played a prominent role during the [[War of the Mark]]. Though she is commonly seen
as a monster, the records of the war suggest that she was
loath to use her power unless forced to, and might even
have despised the aberrant mark she carried. Together with Lord [[Halas Tarkanan]], she released the full power of her [[aberrant dragonmark]] at the end of the war and caused the destruction of early [[Sharn]], and some claim that the Lady's death-curse still lingers in the depths of [[Old Sharn]] to this day, over a millenium later.
