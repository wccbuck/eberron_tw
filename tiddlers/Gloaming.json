Here, malformed trees\nare hosts to parasites, disease, and swarms of horrid\ninsects. Monstrous beetles, spiders, and centipedes\nattack unwary travelers. The [[druid]]s believe that this\nplace marks the location of a [[manifest zone]] to [[Mabar]],\nthe Endless Night. It could also have close ties to the [[layer]] of [[Lamannia]] known as the [[Rot]].\n\nThe [[Children of Winter]] often dwell among the twisted trees here, meditating on the cycle of life and death.",
