The [[druid]]s believe that this\nplace marks the location of a [[manifest zone]] to [[Mabar]],\nthe Endless Night. It could also have close ties to the [[layer]] of [[Lamannia]] known as the [[Rot]].\n\nThe [[Children of Winter]] often dwell among the twisted trees here, meditating on the cycle of life and death.", "modified": "20210727192010570", "tags": "[[Eldeen Reaches]] Khorvaire forest", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "article": "the ", "category": "location", "color": "#3B5C0A", "list-after": "Towering Wood", "polygons": "41.492,-28.79 41.575,-28.42 41.566,-28.09 41.409,-27.43 41.225,-27.2 40.8,-27.09 40.403,-27.1 40.135,-26.95 39.683,-26.95 39.406,-27.07 39.258,-27.4 38.945,-27.94 38.889,-28.21 38.982,-28.62 39.415,-28.9 39.914,-29.02 40.108,-29.19 40.108,-29.38 40.191,-29.63 40.477,-30.03 40.874,-29.95 41.197,-29.78 41.382,-29.47 41.474,-29.12", "style": "{\"color\":\"#333C1A\",\"fillOpacity\":\"0\",\"weight\":2,\"dashArray\":\"4, 9\",\"opacity\":\"0.5\"}"}
