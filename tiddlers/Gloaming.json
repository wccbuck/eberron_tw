Here, malformed trees are hosts to parasites, [[disease]], and swarms of horrid insects. Monstrous beetles, spiders, and centipedes\nattack unwary travelers. The [[druid]]s believe that this region marks the location of a massive [[manifest zone]] to the [[plane]] of [[Mabar]].\n\nThe [[Children of Winter]] often dwell among the twisted trees here, meditating on the cycle of life and death. Because [[Mabar]] brings only death and decay, the Children use their [[druidic magic|primal magic]] to contain the influence of the Gloaming and prevent it from throwing off the balance of nature.",
