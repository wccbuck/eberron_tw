        "text": "[[Stormreach]]’s oldest temple of the [[Sovereign Host]] was\nfounded in [[Forgelight]], before the [[Temple District]] was\nestablished. Mercenaries often visit the temple to make\nofferings to [[Dol Dorn]] or [[Dol Arrah]]. But many visitors are surprised when they see that the temple is dedicated to an unusual variation of the Host, the [[Church of the Wyrm Ascendant]].\n\nThis temple is easily identified by the Octogram\nsymbol above its gate. The icons within the temple\ndepict the gods in draconic form; mosaics depict images of these [[dragon]]s in battle with\n[[fiend]]s. The priests of the Wyrm believe that those who serve\nthe [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]] and build a hoard can literally buy\ntheir way into the heavens, joining the Sovereigns on\na transcendent plane as heavenly dragons. According to rumors, a hoard of treasures lies beneath the temple, which includes two centuries of tithes combined with a vast\narray of draconic artifacts and relics recovered over\nthe decades.\n\nThe temple’s high priest is [[Maru Sakhesh]]. His chief acolytes are Cael Duryn, a kind [[elf]] who nevertheless believes in the Wyrm Ascendant doctrine that miracles have their price, and Tania Drake, a young and ambitious [[human]] [[cleric]] who is very interested in recovering draconic artifacts from the wilds of [[Xen'drik]].",
