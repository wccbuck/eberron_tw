type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Each [[goblin]] or [[kobold]] tribe in [[Little Graywall]] has its own building in the Tribal Warrens, which is a structure that serves both as workhouse and barracks. Symbols painted over the door or embedded in the walls indicate the tribe that lives within: the Bone Crows, Hammer-Knockers, Hidden Hands, Stonebreakers, and others. By and
large, each tribe focuses on a specific trade; the Stonebreakers work in the mines and quarries, while the Hammer-Knockers are blacksmiths and armorers.
