[[Dragons|dragon]] possess a wide range of personalities and motivations. Though they display more racial solidarity than many other creatures, rebels do exist. Not every dragon cares for the [[Chamber]] or the [[Prophecy|Draconic Prophecy]]—or even for other dragons. These rogue dragons operate independently.

!! Rogue Dragons of Khorvaire

Rogue dragons favor [[Khorvaire]] over all other continents. Whether they disagree with the [[Chamber]]’s purpose or methodology, or fled [[Argonnessen]] in fear of their lives, or are selfish, loners, or greedy, rogue dragons find Khorvaire a hospitable land. The rise and fall of cities and the glut of races provides a shifting backdrop against which to camouflage themselves. Minions and servitors are easy to find, and the [[Chamber]] has more pressing concerns on Khorvaire than tracking down
rogues. Usually.

Rogue dragons don’t share motivations or desires;
their behavior is as varied and complex as the [[dragon]]s
themselves. However, several common themes crop up
among the rogues who lair on [[Khorvaire]]: money, power,
solitude, and independence.

Khorvaire’s wealth is a great draw to rogue dragons.
The [[Chamber]] monitors and guards its artifacts and
relics carefully, but rogues take what they wish and
share with no one. Powerful [[magic item]]s and hidden
treasure troves left over from the [[Last War]] dot the land,
many hidden so deeply and so well that ordinary beings
stand no chance of discovering them. Only creatures as
powerful as [[dragon]]s can find and claim these treasures
for themselves.

Many rogues also enjoy feeling powerful and
in control. On [[Argonnessen]], greater dragons often
dominate smaller, weaker dragons. When surrounded
by lesser beings, though, even the lowliest dragon
feels impressive. The pursuit of wealth is often combined with the lust for power. A rogue dragon might take on minions, then use them to search for greater treasures; the more wealth she possesses, the more she can expend on acquiring even greater wealth and
more servitors.

Achieving a position of authority within the [[Chamber]] or the [[Conclave]] can take centuries or more. On [[Khorvaire]], a clever [[dragon]] can set up a power
structure with himself at the head in under a decade, all without risking the incredible dangers of the [[Vast]]. Dragons in the Vast, wild as they are, still play by the rules of the Conclave. Rogue dragons are true rebels who flout the “sandbox” of the Vast and the draconic authorities.

!! Rogue Dragons in Xen'drik

Few dragons entertain the idea of visiting [[Xen'drik]]’s
savage shores. Tales of the Great Fall are burned into
the minds of young dragons, leaving many with the mistaken impression that the forsaken continent is a desolate wasteland of bleached giant bones and blasted earth. The thought of visiting this reminder of their race’s greatest disgrace remains repugnant.

Only two paths lead [[dragon]]s to [[Xen'drik]] today—duty
and dishonor. Since the rise of the [[Inspired]] threat in
[[Sarlona]], the [[Eyes of Chronepsis]] are no longer willing
to exile criminal dragons into the waiting arms of the
[[quori]]. Xen’drik is now the nesting ground for castoffs,
malcontents, and criminals; most dragons found there
are rogues. The majority are delinquents who were banished to the forsaken continent by mandate of the Eyes.

There is one reason beyond exile and guardianship for [[dragon]]s to end up in [[Xen'drik]]. Although the [[Vast]] serves as a proving ground for young dragons and
offers them the freedom to exercise power over lesser creatures, some dragons’ fantasies of domination are too grotesque to enact among their own kind. Such
depraved dragons choose self-exile to Xen’drik in
exchange for the right to play god among [[giant]] rabble
and other groveling tribes of natives. Chafing at the
closeness of other dragons in the Vast, these wyrms head
to the wide expanses of the forsaken continent, where
they might spend a thousand years never crossing paths
with another of their kind.

!! Rogue Dragons of Sarlona

Rogue dragons have long inhabited [[Sarlona]]. However, the desert drakes and mountain guardians of this land are very different from the hoard-wyrms and [[Chamber]] exiles of [[Xen'drik]] and [[Khorvaire]]. A number of Sarlonan rogues fled recently from [[Argonnessen]], for personal or political reasons, choosing the relative peace of Sarlona to the chaos that is Xen’drik. Though exceptions exist, most such first-generation exiles hail from the lands of the [[Tapestry]], just as a majority of [[Xen'drik]] exiles arrive there from the unfettered expanses of the [[Vast]].

Unlike those of [[Xen'drik]], many rogues of [[Sarlona]] are native to that land—descendants of [[dragon]]s who were here long before the rise of the [[sorcerer]]-kings.
What part those ancestor dragons might have played
in the rule of Sarlona prior to the [[Sundering]] remains
an open question. That period of great and terrible
wars shattered the old kingdoms and paved the way for
[[Inspired]] rule, and much of the history of old Sarlona
was purged when the Inspired remade the continent in
their own image.

Fragmentary accounts of the reign of the sorcerer-kings can be found in the legends of [[Aventus|Aventus Islands]], [[Ghirvagura]] (now part of [[Riedra]]), and [[Khunan]] (the land on whose ruins the [[yuan-ti]] built [[Syrkarn]]). Modern sages theorize that some of those ancient rulers could have actually been rogue dragons in [[human]] form, building empires in a land their [[Prophecy|Draconic Prophecy]]-obsessed kin ignored. If this idea is true, it might explain the origins of the devastating conflicts between the sorcerer-kings of [[Ghirvagura]] and the secret [[shulatlaca]] leaders of [[Caleshaz]]. If means also that the oft-ridiculed tales of draconic blood flowing in the veins of [[Khorvaire]]’s [[human]] [[sorcerer]]s might be more than mere fancy.
