In the [[Dar San]] district in [[Sharn]], the true power rests with the [[Inspired]] warrior
Hamatash. Hamatash maintains a low profile, but he is the disposable tool of the [[Dreaming Dark]]â€”if the Dark needs to take some action without revealing the existence of their sleeper agents, they use Hamatash and the Riedran militia.
