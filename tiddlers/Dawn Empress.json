Her defining principle is growth, the opportunity to reach your full\npotential, and all [[layer]]s of her realm reflect this. \n\nThe Dawn Empress is a [[celestial]] figure wreathed in light, though she can\nassume the shape of any [[humanoid]] or [[angel]]. She presides over\nfestivals and tends the needs of her people, but she spends\nmuch of her time focused on the cultivation of her planar seeds.\nShe occasionally works with mortals, typically [[warlock]]s; while\nshe may have missions tied to planar seeds or to clashing\nwith agents of [[Mabar]], she also gives her agents tasks that are\ndesigned to help them with their own growth and evolution.\n\nThe [[Mabar]]an counterpart of the Dawn Empress is the [[Empress of Shadows]].",
