type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Once a respected [[Cyran|Cyre]] weaponsmith, Weston “Scabs” Yeardley was gravely wounded and terribly disfigured on the Day of [[Mourning]]. He
now buys, sells, crafts, and repairs weaponry in [[Stillwater Station]]—mostly
items scavenged from the battlefields of Old Cyre. He
has constructed a functional smithy from the ruins of
an existing forge on the station grounds.

Scabs has a carefully guarded secret: The coal in
the abandoned forge has been somehow altered by
the arcane energy of the [[Mournland]] and is apparently inexhaustible—it burns, but does not burn out. When he can arrange transport, Scabs intends to
escape Stillwater with the magic coal and make his
fortune in the civilized lands. Scabs buys and sells
basic armor and weapons.
