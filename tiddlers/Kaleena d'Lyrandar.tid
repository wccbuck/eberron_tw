type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

An independent scion of House
[[Lyrandar]], Kaleena d’Lyrandar guides teams and cargo upriver on
the Watersnake, a unique [[elemental-bound|elemental vessel]] skiff. This
vessel was a personal project of Kaleena’s mother, and
she devoted her fortune to developing it. The [[soarwood]] craft is powered by a small water [[elemental]] and can carry up to 10 humanoids 15 miles per hour
upriver against a moderately strong river current, or
25 miles per hour through still waters. The [[artificer]]s built stealth magic into the raft as well; Keleena can activate magical darkness, mist, or silence a few times per day. The skiff requires the [[Mark of Storm]] to activate. Kaleena has little to do with the [[house enclave|Falconer's Spire]] in [[Stormreach]] and despises the current [[viceroy|Calynden d'Lyrandar]].
