        "text": "The Frostwall Mountains in [[Dor Maleer]], [[Riedra]], stretch from the coast of the [[Sea of Rage]] to the [[Kelneluun]].\n\nThese mountains hold several [[wild zone]]s to [[Risia]] and [[Dolurrh]]. One such zone to Dolurrh is known as the ''Final Passage''. When the moon [[Aryth]] is full, those who venture into this cavern can enter the [[Catacombs]] of [[Dolurrh]]. This offers a way to recover a soul that cannot be resurrected through normal means. But the Catacombs have guardians, and the [[Queen of the Dead]] doesn't surrender her subjects easily. \n\nThe Final Passage doesn't unleash threats into the world, and mortals who enter it almost never return; so while there are a few [[Edgewalker|Edgewalkers]] outposts monitoring the region, the Passage and other [[wild zone]]s are largely accessible to adventurers.
