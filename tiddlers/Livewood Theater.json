It is built on an ancient amphitheater dating back to the [[Age of Giants]]. Mostly offering up classics of [[Brelish|Breland]], [[Aundair]]ian, or [[Cyran|Cyre]] playwrights, the\nLivewood spares no expense and attracts sellout crowds\nto its amphitheater four days a week, [[Wir through Sar|Khorvaire calendar]].\nThe shows are often nostalgia works beating patriotic\ndrums and offering exiles and expatriates glimpses of\ntheir distant homelands.\n\nEpics from [[Thrane]] and [[Karrnath]] were performed\nin the past, but no longer. A few years ago, a large\ngroup of Karrns crashed a performance of //Rainbow Serpents Rising//. Bedlam and bloodshed ensued. Thranes responded in kind two months later during the opening performance of //Ride of the Rekkenmark//. The Livewood’s\nmanager, [[Zarzalia|Zarzalia Shol d'Phiarlan]], has since banned patriotic\nplays from both nations.",
