        "text": "Although there is a strong rivalry between\nHouse [[Thuranni]] and House [[Phiarlan]], there is a strict limit to the feud:\nno assassination. If a Phiarlan interferes with the mission of a Thuranni,\nhe’ll try to prove his superior skills,\nbut he won’t expose the rival spy. It’s\na game. But there is a third player,\nand it doesn’t follow the rules. The\nBloody Shadows are the survivors of\nthe [[Paelion]] line, those skilled or lucky enough\nto escape the extermination attempt. Though few in\nnumber, the Bloody Shadows are lethal assassins,\ncareful and patient. The Shadows want to make their\ncousins suffer; a Bloody Shadow might draw out his\nvengeance against a [[Phiarlan]] PC over months or\nyears, causing as much pain as possible before striking the final blow.",
