        "text": "For decades, [[Breland]] has maintained a consulate in the\nheart of the [[Sloths]]. Its paint peeling and shutters askew,\nthe consulate is a stately building that has seen better\ndays. \n\nWhen [[Stormreach]] was founded, the king of [[Galifar]]\nestablished a consulate in the city. But as the age of\npiracy came to an end and Galifar turned its attention elsewhere, the consulate became a position with no true power. In 894 YK, the [[Brelish|Breland]] consul\nof Stormreach was a lord named Kainen irâ€™Ranek.\nWhen word reached Stormreach that [[Jarot|Jarot ir'Wynarn]] was dead\nand that [[Wroann|Wroann ir'Wynarn]] was defying her sister [[Mishann|Mishann ir'Wynarn]], Kainen was quick to act. Gathering the Brelish and supplementing his forces with [[Deneith]] mercenaries, he laid claim to the consulate. Neither Kainen\nnor his successors ever managed to sway the [[Storm Lords]] to choose a side in the war, and none of the other [[Five Nations]] bothered to establish embassies in Stormreach.\n\nBreland has maintained a consulate in [[Cross]] for decades but has had little influence. The consul serves at the pleasure of the [[Breland Parliament]], and the post\nis currently held by Lady [[Rusila ir'Clarn]].",
