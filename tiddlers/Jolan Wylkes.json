        "text": "The inclusion of the [[Wylkes family]] among the [[Storm Lords]] of [[Stormreach]] was a concession to [[Galifar]]. As a [[sorcerer]] and sailor, Jolan Wylkes spent more time as a privateer than he did as a pirate, and the king of Galifar wanted someone he could trust to see that the Storm Lords lived up to their promises. Although many in the city despised Jolan Wylkes, they respected his prowess at sea and the talents of the Wylkes\nshipwrights. It was clear that Jolan’s presence was\na necessary evil. He was made the fifth Storm Lord,\nbut he was not a lord of the city. In a compromise\nbetween the demands of Galifar and the distaste\nthat the others felt for Wylkes, he was declared the\nHarbor Lord—the gatekeeper of the city but always\non the outside.",
