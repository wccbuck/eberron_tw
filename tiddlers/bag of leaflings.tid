title: bag of leaflings
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This bag is filled with leaves. When you reach into the bag and pull one out, the leaf animates as a little forest [[fey]]. You can ask the spirit to scout ahead, deliver messages a la [[animal messenger]], or other small tasks for up to 24 hours, at which point the leaf dries and crumbles and the spirit returns to its native plane.
