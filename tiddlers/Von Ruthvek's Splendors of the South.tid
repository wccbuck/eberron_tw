type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The best-known antiquities dealer in [[Stormreach]], Valexa Von Ruthvek ([[gnome]] [[magewright]]) is an expert on the city’s past and its surroundings. Her shop is like a museum, with a wide array of [[magic item]]s and other curiosities. She sponsors occasional expeditions into [[Xen'drik]]’s interior and has begun to receive funding from a group of anonymous benefactors, whom she only knows through intermediaries. The one condition put on the funds is that each expedition must go deeper into the wilds
than the ones before it.

Valexa has a somewhat random selection of magic items in stock. She can cast [[identify]] for a price, or [[remove curse]] for favored clients.
