A mohrg is a powerful [[undead]] created using an ancient and esoteric [[necromantic|necromancy]] ritual. A mohrg looks like a gaunt, nearly skeletal corpse, with a rib cage filled with horrid, writhing viscera. The creature's tongue is long, cartilaginous, and clawed. They move much faster than shambling [[zombie]]s, and its tongue can lash out and strike creatures like a snake, paralyzing them for several horrifying minutes.

Creatures killed by a mohrg often rise after <<dr 1d4>> days as [[zombie]]s under the mohrg's control.
