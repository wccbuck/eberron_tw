Cannith Enclave is the headquarters of [[Cannith South]], and occupies the whole of Cannith Tower in [[Central Plateau]], [[Sharn]]. In both [[Highest Towers]]
([[Upper Central]]) and [[Granite Halls]] ([[Lower Central]]), members of House [[Cannith]]'s [[Fabricators Guild]] operate artisans' shops in the tower. [[Merrix d'Cannith]] leads this [[enclave]]. [[Tarya d'Cannith]] is a notable [[alchemist]] and potion production engineer.

The tower extends down into the [[Cannith Forgehold]] in [[Ashblack]], Merrix's heavily warded personal domain.
