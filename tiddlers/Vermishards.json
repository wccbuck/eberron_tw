These plateaus held the ancestral homes of the noble\nlines of old Metrol with the Royal Vermishard, the seat of the [[Cyran|Cyre]]\ncrown. However, over centuries, other powers—such as House\n[[Cannith]] and House [[Phiarlan]]—made their way to the Vermishards\nas well. Cannith and Phiarlan worked together with Cyran\n[[magewright]]s to embed illusory lighting into the Vermishards, their\nglittering spires becoming a remarkable part of the Metrol skyline. The finest warriors of [[Galifar]] served in the Vermishard Guard; after the onset of the [[Last War]], these soldiers formed the core of [[Cyre]]'s new military academy.\n\nThe Vermishards, and the rest of [[Cyre]], have lain in ruin since the [[Mourning]]. Today, they are inhabited by the self-styled ruler of the ruins of Metrol, \"Empress\" [[Donata]].",
