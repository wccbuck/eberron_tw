        "text": "The Company of the Black Crown is an infamous band of brigands who operate in the western frontier region of [[Breland]], led by [[Breggan Blackcrown]]. The core members of the company were once members of an elite unit of Brelish soldiers stationed at [[Orcbone]], but deserted two years ago rather than face disciplinary measures for their repeated violation of orders and wanton cruelty.\n\nThe Black Crowns are a mobile force trained in the techniques of guerilla warfare. They possess a few [[long rod]]s and other military-grade weapons. They ride the [[Border Road]] along very edge of [[Droaam]] and [[Breland]], preying on the people of both lands. They frequently target other brigands and clash with [[Droaam]] raiders, and most believe that this is why the commander of [[Orcbone]] chooses to ignore them; others say that the commander is one of [[Breggan|Breggan Blackcrown]]’s former lovers, or that he doesn’t want to send his soldiers to their deaths. Regardless of the reason, [[Orcbone]] isn’t pursuing the Black Crowns for now.\n\nWhile the Black Crowns ruthlessly slaughter other brigands and raiders, they also rob small villages and caravans—never entirely, just “collecting the Crown’s share.” While they usually don’t kill villagers, they make a bloody example of anyone who challenges them.\n\nBesides [[Breggan Blackcrown]], high-ranking lieutenants of the Company include ''Hatchet'' ([[halfling]] man, an expert scout), Breggan's bodyguard ''Blessing'' (femme personality [[warforged]], a heavily armored defensive fighter) and ''Sigil'' ([[human]] man, the war mage who maintains the company’s artillery).",
