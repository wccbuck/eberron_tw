Sul is a [[Tharashk]] hunter of the [['Aashta]] clan whose life is shaped by two forces: her faith in the [[Inner Sun]], and her dreams of her destined enemy, a mighty warrior forged of steel and stone. Guided by her dreams, Sul’aashta seeks to slay [[warforged]], and she sells her services hunting warforged criminals and fugitives. She also spends a great deal of time roaming the [[Mournland]] and preying on the [[construct]]s that live there.
