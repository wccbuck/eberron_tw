//No creature could match the Titan King [[Cul'sir]] in power or greed. His strength was immeasurable. He knew one thousand spells and held the treasures of a continent in his vaults, and yet he still hungered for more. He held the [[elves|elf]] in his thrall, yet some were sly enough to slip through his fingers and find refuge in the wilds. Many of these free people wished to flee as fast and as far as possible from the Titan King, but there was one who stopped their flight and rallied them together: Vadallia.//

//Vadallia was born in the saddle and learned the tongue of horses before she learned our own. No [[elf]] understood the ways of war as she did. She wielded soldiers as a master wields a blade. One of her eyes was a diamond, through which she could see glimmers of the future. In this way she knew that the elves would never see peace while [[Cul'sir]] still lived, and that no one clan could stand against him alone. Such was her passion that she united the Taeri and the Elorrenthi, and brought Shol and Thuranni to one table. Time and again she clashed with Cul’sir and his host, testing the king and learning his strength. She knew she could goad him to meet her on the battlefield... but she also knew that for all the skill of her warriors, steel alone could not match the magic of the [[giant]]s.//

//At that time, the elves were still slaves of the giants. But there was magic in their blood, a potential that the giants could not match... and when [[Cul'sir]] saw that potential in a slave, he raised him as one of his own. So it was with Cardaen. He was born in a high tower and Cul’sir made sure Cardaen’s feet never touched the ground. Cardaen crafted mystic weapons for the [[giant]]s, never knowing that they were used against his own kind. He cared only for magic—until he met Vadallia. The Queen of Swords caught a glimpse of Cardaen through her crystal eye and knew that his magic could turn the tide of the war. And so she led her band into the heart of Cul’sir’s Throne and carried the [[wizard]] away with her. It was a dangerous move, and it allowed Cul’sir to place a [[scrying]] trace upon Vadallia. The giant then assembled his army for war.//

//As she prepared for battle, Vadallia urged Cardaen to fight at her side. Though her words touched his heart, Cardaen still thought of the giants as his kin instead of his captors, and he refused to raise his hand against them. Vadallia pleaded with him, telling him that his true people needed him, and still he resisted. In the end Vadallia fought the battle without him, while he watched from afar. Her warriors battled without fear, and her strategies were brilliant. [[Drow|drow]] and [[giant]] fell before the united clans. Then [[Cul'sir]] unleashed a terrible weapon, a lingering curse that rotted the bones within the body. It was a spell Cardaen had created, and when he saw it used and realized the suffering he had brought to his own kind, he was filled with horror. He took to the battlefield and shattered the curse. His fury lent him strength, and he blunted every spell the [[giant]]s threw against him. For the first time in his life, the Titan King knew fear; he fled the battlefield, and his host was scattered to the far corners of the earth. Yet Cardaen’s revelation had come too late for Vadallia. He found her on the battlefield, mortally wounded by the curse he had made. No one knows what words passed between them before she died; when he left the battlefield there were tears on his cheeks, and he held her crystal eye in his hand. From that day forward he was a force for vengeance, and the giants feared his name.//

//When Aeren led the elves to their [[haven|Aerenal]], Cardaen remained behind. He remembered Vadallia’s vision—that the elves would never see peace while [[Cul'sir]] still lived. His final fate remains a mystery. But by the time the elves reached Aeren’s Rest, Cul’sir had fallen... and so their future was secured.//

The lives of the [[Tairnadal]] [[elves|elf]] are shaped by those of their patron ancestors. When an elf comes of age, the [[Keepers of the Past|Spirits of the Past]] read the signs to determine which of the patron ancestors has laid claim to the child. From that point forward it is the sacred duty of the child to become the living avatar of the fallen champion, mastering their skills and living by their code. The people of the [[Five Nations]] know little about the Tairnadal, and their general assumptions often don’t make sense. Ask ten people in [[Sharn]], and you’ll hear that the [[Valenar]] are bloodthirsty brutes who love to pillage the weak; that they seek glory in battle and won’t fight a weaker foe; that they are bound by a strict code of honor; that they have no honor; that every Valenar is bound to a [[horse|Valenar beast]]; and so on. In fact, no one rule applies to every [[Tairnadal]], for every ancestor demands a different role of their descendants. A child chosen by Maelian Steelweaver will spend their days forging swords instead of wielding them. One chosen by Silence will spend life in the shadows, never touching a horse. War is the common thread that unites the Tairnadal, because the wars against [[giant]]s, [[dragon]]s, and [[goblin]]s were what produced these legendary heroes. As such, the Tairnadal seek conflicts that will let them face the same odds and fight in the same style as their ancestors. Nowadays a child of Vadallia can’t fight giants, because the [[Cul'sir Dominion|Cul'sir]] has fallen, but they must search for a foe that is equally challenging and then defeat it in the same way Vadallia would, thus creating new legends in Vadallia’s name.

Any time you create a [[Tairnadal]] character, you should consider their patron ancestor. What was the ancestor famous for? What were the ancestor’s deeds or talents? What enemies did the ancestor fight, and what were their preferred tactics? Bear in mind that the ancestor chooses the [[elf]], not the other way around; some ancestors were known for their cruelty, or might have other unappealing traits. A Tairnadal elf is expected to embody every aspect of his or her ancestor, both positive and negative. And it is the goal of each elf to become the vessel through which that ancestor truly lives again.

Vadallia and Cardaen are examples of patron ancestors, and the following sections describe what it means to follow in their footsteps. Use these as models when creating other ancestors. What drove the ancestors in battle? What connections did they have to other heroes? How did they die?

Also remember that although each [[Tairnadal]] emulates their patron, each can interpret the ancestor’s life in different ways. Three individual [[Valenar]] warlords chosen by Vadallia might each be a passionate, inspiring leader driven to do what’s best for the Tairnadal—but they might have different ideas of what the “best” is. The patron ancestor inspires the elf, but each Valenar remains a unique individual.

!! Vadallia's Chosen

Vadallia was one of the finest warlords of the [[Age of Giants]]. She was a gifted equestrian and a deadly warrior, but her greatest talents were her grasp of strategy and her ability to inspire others. She united rival clans and convinced stubborn heroes to join together beneath her banner. She was driven by her passion and her love of the elven people, yet her love was tempered by a lack of compassion for any other creature except her horse. Vadallia was utterly ruthless when it came to acquiring essential weapons, magic, and other treasures that her people needed to survive; though the [[giant]]s were her true foe, she frequently led raids against the other inhabitants of [[Xen'drik]]. She was always prepared to take personal risks and to make sacrifices if they would help her people; as an example of such behavior, it’s said she tore out her own eye to gain the gift of prophecy.

Children chosen by Vadallia must learn to ride and to wield the double scimitar, but they focus on tactics, history, and the broader arts of war. Some of Vadallia’s chosen seek to emulate her dedication to protecting her people. Others seek to emulate her ability to inspire her allies on and off the battlefield. War bands led by one of Vadallia’s chosen often press deep into hostile territory; however, Vadallia’s children are driven by a vision of what’s good for the [[Tairnadal]] as a whole, and their raids have a purpose beyond simple pillage. Even though many of Vadallia’s chosen share her love of the [[elves|elf]], a few exhibit this passion in a different way; a Valenar adventurer might give this devotion to their adopted family of adventurers, provided the group’s goals will ultimately help the elves.

!! Cardaen's Chosen

Cardaen was an [[arcane|arcane magic]] prodigy, raised by [[giant]]s and taught to love magic above all else. In his early life, he was completely absorbed with study. He had no interest in how the rituals he crafted were used; he simply sought to push the laws of magic to their limits. After Vadallia’s death, he realized that magic was pointless if it did not have purpose. He dedicated his life to vengeance, hunting down and punishing those who brought suffering to his people.

[[Tairnadal]] chosen by Cardaen invariably develop remarkable arcane talent. Elves who emulate Cardaen’s early life become [[wizard]]s, pursuing perfection of the magical arts to the exclusion of other goals. Some are cold and dispassionate; others take joy in the study of the arcane, seeing beauty in spellcraft that cannot be found in the natural world. Elves who follow his path of vengeance might also be [[wizard]]s, but they are grim and stoic, pursuing their vengeance at any cost. Some say that to truly follow his path, one must begin with an innocent love of magic and be driven to vengeance by a terrible loss.

To date, Cardaen has never produced an [[artificer]], and an artificer who follows this path would stand out among their kin.

!! Adventure Hooks

Patron ancestors should play a role in any encounter with [[Valenar]] or other [[Tairnadal]]. If a war band is led by one of Vadallia’s chosen, consider what that leader’s purpose might be, and why is this battle in particular is worth fighting? In addition, Vadallia was a superb tactician, and her chosen will act with that same cunning. No child of Vadallia will act without thought or be driven by fury alone. If a player character is chosen by Cardaen or Vadallia, they might find a rival in another who follows the same path, or feel a romantic attraction to an [[elf]] who follows the counterpart of their spirit.

* ''Dungeon Raid!'' Vadallia’s chosen are fearless in pursuit of victory for their war bands and their people, and in obtaining any treasure or object that might aid them in this quest. If adventurers explore a dungeon in search of a powerful relic, they might encounter a war band already searching for the same object. Alternatively, a [[Valenar]] band could strike deep into [[Karrnath]] and seize a mystic weapon from a Karrnathi arsenal. Can the heroes recover the artifact, and if so, should they return it to [[Kaius|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] or destroy it?
* ''Against the Crown:'' [[Shaeras Vadallia]] is the High King of [[Valenar]], and it was his devotion to his ancestor that led him to found his nation. He believes that his actions are in the best interests of the [[Tairnadal]]. However, an adventurer who follows Vadallia’s path could decide that Shaeras is misguided and that his actions are a blight on Vadallia’s memory. Can the hero gain enough skill and strength to challenge the High King and claim the Darkwood Crown?
* ''Vadallia’s Eye:'' Legends say that Vadallia had a diamond eye that granted her visions of the future. The eye passed to Cardaen, and it was lost when the [[dragon]]s laid waste to [[Xen'drik]]. Recovering the Eye would be a great triumph for any of Vadallia’s chosen, but it would certainly create tension between the bearer and the High King.
* ''Cardaen’s Vengeance:'' The chosen of Cardaen are driven by vengeance. One of Cardaen’s chosen might seek to avenge crimes against the [[elves|elf]]; war bands led by Cardaen’s chosen hunt down those who have wronged the elves, and adventurers who have crossed the [[Valenar]] could run afoul of such a group. A Valenar adventurer who follows Cardaen’s path could be approached by a friend from their youth and called upon to avenge an injustice against the race. Of course, Cardaen’s chosen don’t have to limit their vengeance to crimes against the elves; an adventurer would seek to avenge any harm that comes to their allies.
