title: lightning rail
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki
var: lightningrail

The wondrous lightning rail system once linked the
far reaches of the Kingdom of [[Galifar]], prior to the [[Last War]]. Now the system is divided, split into eastern and
western circuits. Reestablishing the [[conductor stone]]
paths across [[Scions Sound]] and the [[Mournland]] is often
discussed in the halls of power in the [[Five Nations]], but
formidable challenges are involved.

!! How It Works

A lightning rail train is made up of an [[elemental vessel]]
linked to a series of connected carts, all of which float
about 5 feet off the ground. Each cart, similar in form
to a large wagon with no wheels, has a [[conductor stone]]
embedded in its underside. A corresponding set of conductor stones laid out in a line on the ground interacts
with the stones in the carts to form a rail for the train to
follow. Lightning arcs between the two sets of stones,
accounting for the system's name.

The elemental vessel at the front of the train, called
a crew cart, holds a bound air [[elemental]] that propels
the train along its route at a speed of about 30 miles per hour. The elemental appears as a ring of lightning
encircling the crew cart while the train is in motion. A
bound air elemental can move a train of up to ten carts
without obvious strain, and most trains are configured
accordingly.

The other carts that make up the train have various
purposes. A typical train has a crew cart at each end,
with two cargo carts, four passenger carts, and two
lounge carts in between. Doors at both ends of each cart
enable crew and passengers to walk from one to the
next, even while the train is in motion. Both crew carts
are identical, except that the bound [[elemental]] in one is
suppressed. On the return trip, the roles of the carts and
the states of their elementals are reversed.

Specialized carts of other sorts vary in configuration
depending on their purpose and the degree of luxury
afforded to them. Some have solid sides and roofs, while
others are covered only with canvas.

''//Operation.//'' The vessel's pilot, a House [[Orien]] [[dragonmark]]ed heir, stands at the helm, high atop the crew cart, beneath the [[elemental binding]] struts. The pilot controls
the [[elemental]] and communicates with it during the trip,
watching the path ahead through broad windows that
encircle the helm platform.

The placement of [[conductor stone]] lines dictates where
a lightning rail train can travel, but the pilot still must
make operational decisions as the coach moves from
one city to the next. The pilot controls the vessel's speed
based on conditions around the train. When conductor
stone lines split, as they do at various hubs along the
way, the pilot selects the intended route and directs the
[[elemental]] down the correct line.

The crew of a train includes handful of chief stewards overseeing a number of lesser stewards who are
charged with seeing to the needs of passengers and
keeping cargo secured.

!! Lightning Rail Stations

Lightning rail stations, where passengers and cargo can
be disembarked or loaded, are located in or just outside
villages, towns, and cities along the conductor stone
paths. There are no stations in the expanses between
these settlements, and House [[Orien]] rules prohibit lightning rail pilots from stopping anywhere but at a station.

Stations throughout [[Khorvaire]] have a similar look
and feel, to ensure that each one lives up to the high
expectations of House Orien's patrons. White and gold
[[everbright lantern]]s continually illuminate each station.
When a train pulls into the station, loading ramps are
moved into position beside each cargo cart, and stairs
by each passenger cart. The cargo is unloaded from one
side of the train and the passengers from the other.

Individual stations do have distinct touches that reflect
local features. For example, the station in [[Gatherhold]], in
the [[Talenta Plains]], is decorated with traditional [[halfling]]
motifs and offers specialized stables for travelers leaving their [[dinosaur]]s behind. On a larger scale, the station
at [[Passage]], which is the seat of power for House [[Orien]],
is a multistoried structure designed as a monument to
the majesty and storied history of the house.
