The [[gnome]] sages of the [[Library of Korranberg]]\ncall it the Dragonmarked Age, asserting that the appearance of\nthe [[dragonmark]]s and the achievements of the [[dragonmarked house]]s are more significant in the grand sweep of history than\nmere human achievements. Most people dodge this debate by\nsimply referring to it as the ''modern age''.\n\nRegardless of where you stand on this argument, a great\ndeal has happened over the last five thousand years.\n\nSee also [[Untold History]].\n\n!!
