        "text": "At the world's poles—[[Everice]] to the south and the Frostfell to the north—you might...\n\n* Discover an ancient civilization hidden beneath the ice.\n* Search for the survivors of a lost expedition.\n*  Find the source of a mysterious mystical signal.\n\nThe Frostfell is thought to be the original homeland of\nthe [[dwarves|dwarf]], and some believe that an ancient nation of\ndwarves still thrives under the ice. Others say that the\nFrostfell was once a verdant realm until the dwarves\nuncovered the prison of an [[archfiend|overlord]], which buried their\nnation under endless ice. These scholars warn against\ndisturbing this overlord, lest a new age of ice be unleashed across the entire world. \n\nMystery shrouds the poles of [[Eberron]]. A few expeditions have ventured to the Frostfell, but no one from\n[[Khorvaire]] has set foot in [[Everice]] in living memory and\nreturned to speak of it. \n\n!! The Poles' Influence in Khorvaire\n\nIn [[Khorvaire]], you might...\n\n* Clash with a cabal of winter [[warlock]]s serving a sinister power stirring in [[Everice]].\n* Encounter a group of [[frost giant]]s or Frostfell dwarves establishing a foothold in Khorvaire.\n* Discover a journal from a Frostfell expedition that reveals a horrifying threat.\n\nThe people of Khorvaire have no commerce with the\narctic regions and no certainty about what lives there. If\na threat comes from Frostfell, it might take time for people to identify its origin.\n\nWith this in mind, relics from Everice or the Frostfell\ncould take any form. Are these treasures created by [[giant]]s, [[fey]], or [[dwarves|dwarf]]? Are they carved from eternal ice,\nor are they forged from dwarven steel? If the civilization\nof the dwarves truly began in the Frostfell, did it fall\ninto ruin, or are there progenitor dwarves who possess\nspells and weapons beyond anything known in [[Khorvaire]]? And how would these ancient dwarf lords react to\ntheir [[Mror|Mror Holds]] descendants? \n\n!!! Trinkets from the Frostfell and Everice\n\n| !<<dr d8>> |!Trinket |\n| 1 |A small prism carved from ice that doesn't melt |\n| 2 |A rusted iron coin, depicting a dwarf lord and the worlds \"Five Rex Undra\" |\n| 3 |A pair of eight-sided dice carved from ice that doesn't melt |\n| 4 |A swatch of silvery fur that's cold to the touch, possibly from a winter wolf |\n| 5 |A snowball; it doesn't melt and can't be compressed into ice |\n| 6 |A tiny [[white dragon]] sculpted from ice that doesn't melt |\n| 7 |A key carved from ice that doesn't melt |\n| 8 |A single scale from a [[white dragon]] |",
