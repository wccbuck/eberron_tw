A few expeditions have ventured to the Frostfell, but no one from [[Khorvaire]] has set foot in [[Everice]] in living memory and\nreturned to speak of it. \n\nThe Frostfell is thought to be the original homeland of\nthe [[dwarves|dwarf]], and some believe that an ancient nation of\ndwarves still thrives under the ice. Others say that the\nFrostfell was once a verdant realm until the dwarves\nuncovered the prison of an [[archfiend|overlord]], which buried their\nnation under endless ice. These scholars warn against\ndisturbing this overlord, lest a new age of ice be unleashed across the entire world. \n\nThe northern coastline of the [[Bitter Sea]] is perhaps the most thoroughly explored section of the Frostfell, but that isn't saying much. This region is home to the ill-fated mining colony known today as [[Sunless Feoral]]. On the other side of the globe, only one expedition has ever explored the northern [[White Sea]] coast and safely returned, led by the legendary [[Boroman ir'Dayne]] of the [[Wayfinder Foundation]]; [[Dayne Bay]] bears the great explorer's name today.\n\n!! The North Pole's Influence in Khorvaire\n\nIn [[Khorvaire]], you might...\n\n* Clash with a cabal of winter [[warlock]]s serving a sinister power stirring in the far north.\n* Encounter a group of Frostfell [[dwarves|dwarf]] or even [[frost giant]]s establishing a foothold in Khorvaire.\n* Discover a journal from a Frostfell expedition that reveals a horrifying threat.\n\nThe people of Khorvaire have no commerce with the\narctic regions and no certainty about what lives there. If\na threat comes from Frostfell, it might take time for people to identify its origin.\n\nWith this in mind, relics from the Frostfell could take any form. Are these treasures created by [[giant]]s, [[fey]], or [[dwarves|dwarf]]? Were they pulled from the mines of doomed [[Feoral|Sunless Feoral]]? Are they carved from eternal ice, or are they forged from dwarven steel? If the civilization of the dwarves truly began in the Frostfell, did it fall into ruin, or are there progenitor dwarves who possess spells and weapons beyond anything known in [[Khorvaire]]? And how would these ancient dwarf lords react to their [[Mror|Mror Holds]] descendants? \n\n!!! Trinkets from the Frostfell\n\n| !<<dr d6>> |!Trinket |\n| 1 |A small prism carved from ice that doesn't melt |\n| 2 |A rusted iron coin, depicting a dwarf lord and the words \"Five Rex Undra\" |\n| 3 |A [[snow sapphire]] fragment |\n| 4 |A swatch of silvery wolf fur that's cold to the touch |\n| 5 |A key carved from ice that doesn't melt |\n| 6 |A single scale from a [[white dragon]] |",
