        "text": "Nolan Toranak ([[dwarf]] councilor for the [[Cogs]]) represents the industrial powers behind\n[[Ashblack]] and [[Blackbones]]. The nobles and merchant princes of [[Skyway]] and the [[Upper City|upper ward]] own many of the foundries and forges in the [[Cogs]], and Nolan usually aligns himself with one of the more eloquent councilors. The one issue that he does feel strongly about is the status of the [[warforged]]. His children were killed by warforged during the [[Last War]], and he has never forgiven House [[Cannith]] or the warforged as a whole. If Nolan had his way, all warforged would be melted down or banished. As it is, he tries to find ways to bypass the stipulations of the [[Treaty of Thronehold]], so [[warforged]] can be treated as property. There are a few groups of people in [[Sharn]] who share Nolan's fear and hatred of the warforged, and he often channels funds to these organizations. He might hire adventurers to take action against House [[Cannith]] or the prominent warforged of [[Blackbones]]; or if there is a warforged among the party, Nolan could use his power to try to discredit the adventurers and drive them from the city.
