        "text": "The Stormsingers are one of the ten major flights (tribes) of [[harpies|harpy]] native to the [[Byeshk Mountains]]. Along with the Carrion Callers, Last Dirge, and Rotwings, the Stormwings are one of four flights who have pledged loyalty to the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]]; these harpies who left the mountains to “sing Katra's song” have embraced her vision and are thrilled to be building a nation with their voices. \n\nStormsingers embrace the furious power of hurricane and storm. Most Stormsingers are devoted equally to the [[Fury]] and to the [[Devourer]]. They dance through the winds, delighting in the deadly play of lightning. Many Stormsingers are ecstatic mystics who praise the [[Dark Six]] through song and flight, but they can also call down lightning on enemies in battle. If there is reason, they can draw away storms, luring the tempest itself with their songs.",
