Kennrun is a [[Brelish|Breland]] border fort near [[Darguun]] and the [[Mournland]]. It was the site of the clash known as the Battle of Kennrun, during which elements of [[Breland]]'s Red Gauntlet Regiment prevented three heavy brigades from reinforcing the [[Cyran|Cyre]] lines, enabling the Brelish 21st Cavalry to break through and liberate eastern Breland.
