Using honey from beehives in the [[Rubble Warren]], the food stall Beehive Pastries makes miniature cakes, which are so mouthwatering that people actively seek the stand out when they pass through the [[Sloths]]. The baker and owner, Sulman, hears a great deal and sees even more, giving him a side trade as an information broker.
