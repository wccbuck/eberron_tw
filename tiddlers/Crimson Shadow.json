But the sailors of [[Stormreach]] whisper of the Crimson Shadow. \n\nIt was the name of both a vessel and its captain, a [[Khoravar|half-elf]] pirate with a swift sloop. Rather than taking a vessel in open conflict, the Crimson Shadow would approach a target under cover of darkness. In some tales, the Shadow had a crew of swift and silent killers, but most say that the pirate captain would board an enemy vessel on her own and kill its entire crew—taking its most precious cargo aboard her sloop, and abandoning the vessel to drift lifeless. \n\nThe Crimson Shadow was eventually revealed to be ''Jola Wylkes'', daughter of the [[Harbor Master|Wylkes family]] of [[Stormreach]] at the time. Her lineage couldn’t save her, and she was hanged for her crimes. But two months later, another ship was found adrift, its crew butchered. Some say the [[Keeper]] recognized talent when he saw it—and that he returned the Crimson Shadow to the seas, for as long as she continues to send him new souls and the treasures he desires.",
