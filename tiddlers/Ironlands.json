This [[demiplane]], which has the [[Bloodletting]] [[property|universal property]], is home to bands of [[devil]]s and [[demon]]s\nthat engage in their own endless wars. These [[fiend]]s enjoy\nfighting and oppressing mortals, but fortunately, they can't leave\ntheir realm. The [[Ghaash'kala]] [[orc]]s of the [[Demon Wastes]] raid the\nIronlands, pillaging weapons from the warrior fiends. The [[Kech Shaarat]] have expanded their deep vault into the Ironlands; over many centuries, these dar have established an\nalliance with one of the devil clans, allowing them to hold onto\nthis territory. It's up to the GM to decide on the foundation of this\nalliance and whether the Shaarat can leverage it in other ways.\n\nThe Ironlands are the only known source of the [[arjale]] and [[tantulhor]] metals.",
