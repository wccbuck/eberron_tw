type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The [[Black Wrack]] tavern in [[Locksmith Square]] in [[Stormreach]] is owned and operated by a no-nonsense but good-natured fellow named Handlon the
Brick. Called "Brick" by his regular customers, Handlon arrived alone
in the city aboard a cargo ship in late 976 YK. By the start
of 978, he had designed and completed initial construction on the tavern. Within days of its grand opening, the
Black Wrack had become one of the city’s most popular
watering holes. There are many reasons for this, but chief
among them—aside from the wide selection of affordable drinks—is Handlon’s one rule: All are welcome to his hospitality, regardless of race or cultural heritage. If
a squabble erupts, it gets taken outside immediately, or
Handlon puts an end to it, often abruptly and painfully.
Everyone’s gold is good at the Black Wrack.

Handlon’s animal companion is an enormous mastiff (essentially a riding dog), which spends most of its time either sprawled out on the floor by the bar or tracing a lazy perimeter around the tavern’s interior. Its name is Sascha, and no matter how drunk or rowdy the Wrack’s patrons get, they know not to involve the dog in their shenanigans, lest they rouse the animal’s ire or that of its owner.
