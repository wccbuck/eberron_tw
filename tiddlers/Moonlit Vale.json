While it's largely arboreal, there are\nbeautiful valleys, glittering lakes, and a vast mountain. It's\nalways night here, and the moon [[Rhaan]] radiates bright light,\nalways seeming to hang just above the viewer. While the moon\ndoesn't move or change, the seasons do; in winter, the court\nis covered in snow, while in spring, it's in brilliant flower. This\nhas nothing to do with the passage of time, and everything to\ndo with the intrigues of the [[Palace of the Moon]]; the current\nseason indicates which seasonal court is currently dominant.\nThis is a crucial aspect of the Moonlit Vale: //things change//.\nThe [[baronies|barony]] are fixed in their stories, but the intrigues of the\nfour seasons are the story [[Thelanis]] tells itself.\n\nThe Moonlit Vale embodies the general idea of the [[fey]]—otherworldy beauty and magic. There are many natural displays of [[illusion]]—streams of glowing mist, ethereal music, distant song. Motes of light drift slowly through the trees. The [[beast]]s of the region are sleek and graceful, and have unusual\ncolors and patterns. The land is fertile, game is easy to hunt, and adventurers have [[advantage]] on foraging attempts... though hunting without permission may incur the\nwrath of the local fey.",
