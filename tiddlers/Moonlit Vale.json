        "text": "This is the largest [[layer]] of [[Thelanis]] and the heart of the [[plane]].\nThe Moonlit Vale is essentially a country, with the [[feyspire]]s\nspread across it as cities; it's possible to spend days traveling\nfrom spire to spire. While it's largely arboreal, there are\nbeautiful valleys, glittering lakes, and a vast mountain. It's\nalways night here, and the moon [[Rhaan]] radiates bright light,\nalways seeming to hang just above the viewer. While the moon\ndoesn't move or change, the seasons do; in winter, the court\nis covered in snow, while in spring, it's in brilliant flower. This\nhas nothing to do with the passage of time, and everything to\ndo with the intrigues of the [[Palace of the Moon]]; the current\nseason indicates which seasonal court is currently dominant.\nThis is a crucial aspect of the Moonlit Vale: //things change//.\nThe [[baronies|barony]] are fixed in their stories, but the intrigues of the\nfour seasons are the story [[Thelanis]] tells itself.\n\nThe Moonlit Vale embodies the general idea of the [[fey]]—otherworldy beauty and magic. There are many natural displays of [[illusion]]—streams of glowing mist, ethereal music, distant song. Motes of light drift slowly through the trees. The\nbeasts of the region are sleek and graceful, and have unusual\ncolors and patterns. The land is fertile, game is easy to hunt, and adventurers have [[advantage]] on foraging attempts... though hunting without permission may incur the\nwrath of the local fey.",
