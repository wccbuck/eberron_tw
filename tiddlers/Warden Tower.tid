Not to be confused with the [[Warden Towers]] district in [[Middle Menthis]], Warden
Tower is a white obelisk standing on the edge of
the cliff overlooking the [[Clifftop]] district of [[Upper Dura]]. For centuries, Warden Tower has been the home of a line of hermit [[cleric]]s of the [[Silver Flame]], each of whom has taken the title of Warden. These Wardens are charged (by the church) to watch over the [[City of the Dead]] in order to prevent necromancers or [[undead]] from troubling the people of [[Sharn]]. The current Warden is [[Gaia Sotharr]].
