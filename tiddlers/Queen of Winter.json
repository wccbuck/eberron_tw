        "text": "The [[archfey]] known as the Queen of Winter dwells in the frozen wasteland of [[Everice]] at the southernmost reaches of Eberron. She is the archetype at the center of any fairy tale in which the hero has to travel to the very edge of the world to beg the favor of a distant and powerful entity. She commands a host of winter wolves and knights carved from living ice. The queen lives in a glacial palace, and those who overcome her guards and the deadly weather to earn her favor can gain powerful boons.\n",
