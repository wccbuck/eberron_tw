The polished surface of this shield is as reflective as a mirror, but is still as tough as steel, and is resistant to being scuffed or scratched. You have [[advantage]] when actively using this shield to defend against gaze attacks from a creature such as a [[beholder]] or [[medusa]], and if you get a [[critical success|full success]] on such an attempt, you can reflect the gaze attack back at the creature.
