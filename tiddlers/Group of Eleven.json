        "text": "The Group of Eleven was an [[Age of Giants]] alliance of eleven\n[[giant]] city-states, each led by a powerful [[Externalist|Externalist Theory]] [[titan]] mage. Their diverse culture valued competition, believing it drove evolution. Each city-state studied a different [[plane]] of existence, with the exceptions of [[Dal Quor]] (in which the [[Cul'sir|Cul'sir Dominion]] took a keen interest) and [[Mabar]].\n\nThe origins of the Group of Eleven lie in the rise of the [[Cul'sir Dominion]] in northern [[Xen'drik]]. Fearing the armies of the [[God-King|Cul'sir]], eleven cities across the southern half of the continent formed a non-aggression pact known as the Endecimal Treaty and pooled their resources to the north. What began as a show of force to defend against conquest quickly became a flourishing network of mutual enrichment, catalyzing economic growth and spurring the advancement of their arcane mastery. Each of the Eleven came to rely on each other for their [[planar|plane]] specialties, binding them together into a single political entity. But competition for power and prestige was at the heart of this network—a rivalry not only among the eleven city-states, but with the Cul'sir Dominion itself.\n\nUnlike the [[Dominion|Cul'sir Dominion]] and the [[Sulat League]], historical records suggest that none of the Eleven participated in the subjugation of the [[elves|elf]], whether as slaves or research subjects—at least not on the same scale. In fact, it is possible that some of the city-states even supported the elves in their rebellion following the destruction of [[Crya]].\n\n!!
