        "text": "Lord Zoratesh is the commander and high minister of the [[Harmonious Shield]], and coordinates the movements of its divisions. While unified in spirit with the other [[quori]] in their task to prevent the turn of the age in [[Dal Quor]], Zoratesh questions the methods of the [[Devourer of Dreams]]. He has no patience\nfor the slow manipulation of the [[Dreaming Dark]], and\nhe wants to launch an invasion of [[Khorvaire]]. In such a scenario, psionic [[teleportation circle]]s would be used to launch\nsudden and decisive strikes against the capitals of [[Khorvaire]], seeking to eliminate nobles, [[dragonmarked|dragonmarked house]] barons,\nand other threats. Both the [[Devourer|Devourer of Dreams]] and [[Sharadhuna]]\nbelieve that this event would be disastrous, providing a\ncommon enemy to unite the people of [[Khorvaire]], destabilizing [[Riedra]], and risking the ire of the [[dragon]]s, the [[Lords of Dust]], and other conspiracies currently watching from\nthe shadows. Zoratesh currently lacks the support required\nto pursue war, but if an [[Inspired]] invasion of Khorvaire\nwere to happen, Zoratesh would be the one to lead it.\n\n''Getting the PCs Involved:'' A war between [[Khorvaire]] and [[Riedra]] would be a devastating conflict, with the widespread magic of Khorvaire\nand the [[dragonmarked house]]s matched against the devastating [[psionic|psionics]] power of the [[Inspired]] and their willingness\nto sacrifice their fanatical troops. Even if the Riedrans\nwon the conflict, the Khorvairians wouldn't accept defeat\neasily. The unity of Riedra succeeds because the people\nbelieve that the Inspired are saviors, not conquerors.\nHowever, a band of adventurers struggling to raise a\nresistance movement in the wake of a Riedran conquest\ncan form the basis for an interesting campaign, whether\nit's set in Khorvaire, [[Syrkarn]], or the [[Tashana Tundra]].",
