''Hallmarks:'' [[Divine magic|divine magic]], fine crafts, fruit, livestock, the [[Silver Flame]], textiles, wool 

The modern Church of the [[Silver Flame]] was founded in
Thrane, and most of the people of the nation follow this
faith. During the [[Last War]], the people of Thrane chose
to set aside the rule of the monarchy and to embrace
the leadership of the church. For the last seventy years,
Thrane has been a theocracy. The head of the state is
11-year-old Jaela Daran, the divinely selected [[Keeper of the Flame]]. Jaela depends on the [[Council of Cardinals]] to
perform the practical work of running the nation.

The primary purpose of the Silver Flame is to defend
the innocent from supernatural evil. The church has
always had a militant aspect, with battalions of templars
and peasant militias prepared to face [[undead]], [[therianthrope]]s, or other monstrous threats. But compassion
and charity are core values of the church, and the templars are tasked to defend all innocents. Even during the
Last War, if a [[fiend]]ish threat arose in a [[Brelish|Breland]] village,
Thrane templars would ally with the locals to bring an
end to the threat. Not all Thranes rise to this ideal. Zealous Thranes believe the church is destined to reunite [[Galifar]] under the Silver Flame, and corrupt priests are
interested only in power and wealth.

Not all priests are [[cleric]]s, and the typical templar is a
mundane warrior. However, due to the deep faith of its
people, Thrane produces more clerics and [[paladin]]s than
any other nation in [[Khorvaire]]. 

!! Interesting Things About {{!!title}}

* Faith is part of daily life in Thrane, and divine [[adept]]s provide important services. [[Arcane magic|arcane magic]] is also common in Thrane. [[Everbright lantern|everbright lantern]]s light the streets while [[magewright]]s and [[wizard]]s practice their trades, though there are fewer of them than in other nations.
* Every town has a militia ready to deal with supernatural threats, and people stand together to fight darkness. Champions of the light find support and hospitality, but any character who dabbles with dark forces—[[necromancer|necromancy]]s, [[warlock]]s, and the like—finds Thrane a dangerous, unwelcoming place.
* The feudal system of nobility remains in place, but ultimate authority rests in the hands of the church. Queen [[Diani ir'Wynarn]] is the "blood regent," serving as a symbolic advisor to the [[Keeper of the Flame]]. A small fraction of the population would like to see the traditional monarchy restored to power. 

!! Thrane Characters

As you develop a Thrane character, consider the following details:

* ''The Impact of Faith.'' If you want to reflect a close bond to the [[Silver Flame]], you could gain a few [[divine|divine magic]] spells. Archery is a devotional practice of the Silver Flame, so as a martial Thrane you might be a [[silverbow]]. Any Thrane could have a strong connection to the church or have served with the templars during the war.
* ''Church or Crown?'' Do you support the theocracy, or would you like to see power restored to the throne? Many people of faith believe that miring the church in politics distracts it and invites corruption.
* ''Dealing with Darkness.'' The [[Shadow in the Flame|Bel Shalor]] can tempt even the most virtuous soul. How do you react when you encounter corruption and greed? Are you a compassionate person who seeks to lead people to the light, or a zealot determined to crush all darkness? 

!! Cities and Sites

The Church of the [[Silver Flame]] is a militant faith, and
Thrane communities are built around fortified churches
designed to serve as fortresses in times of trouble.
Larger towns maintain sturdy walls patrolled by skilled
archers. A Flamic architectural style appears throughout the region. Buildings incorporate light and soaring
spaces, and icons of the Silver Flame and images of the
martyr [[Tira Miron]] appear throughout the nation.

!! Aftermath of the Last War

The war is over, but deep rifts remain between Thrane
and its neighbors. [[Aundair]]ian war magic created a
blasted wasteland between the two nations. To the east,
the conflict with [[Karrnath]] left farms and cities such as
[[Shadukar]] devastated and abandoned, home only to the
lingering undead left behind after the Karrnathi retreat.

For most, these grim reminders of war strengthen
Thrane resolve. The common people are united by their
faith and sure of the righteousness of their cause. The
[[Silver Flame]] urges people to stand together in the face
of evil, and across the nation, villagers work together to
repair the damage inflicted during the war. People in
a Thrane village regularly cooperate to raise a barn or
practice archery in the fields.

The Silver Flame urges its followers to feel compassion for all people, which often proves a more difficult challenge. Thrane has never forgiven Karrnath for its
use of [[undead]] soldiers, and many Thranes are quick
to imagine all Karrns as agents of darkness. Likewise,
Thranes have bitter memories of the conflict with Aundair, and Aundairian wizards or eldritch knights receive a cold reception.

For most Thranes, the war strengthened their faith
and drew them together. However, some question the
validity of theocratic rule. Such doubt can be found
even among the most devout followers of the faith; such
people fear that the merging of temporal and spiritual
authority distracts the church from its proper mission.
If these doubts spread, a serious faction might seek
to restore Queen Diani to power.

[[Thaliost]] is another open wound. The [[Council of Cardinals]] is determined to hold onto
this prize, but it is a bitter point of contention with [[Aundair]] and a constant source
of tension and violence. In creating a Thrane character, consider how you feel about Thaliost. Would you like to see it returned to Aundair, or do you support Thrane's rule?
