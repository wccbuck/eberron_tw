        "text": "The Path of Inspiration is the prescribed faith of the\n[[Riedra]]n people, and the [[Inspired]] form the pinnacle of\nthat faith's mortal hierarchy. However, in contrast to the\nhalf-whispered rumors that circulate around Riedran\noutposts in [[Khorvaire]], the Inspired are only the emissaries of this faith, not its focus. Instead, the lords of [[Riedra]] are seen as vessels of the great spirits, known as\n//il-altas// in the [[quori]] tongue. These are mortals ascended\nto a higher state of being—a state to which all who follow\nthe Path of Inspiration aspire.\n\nTo Khorvairian worshipers of the [[Sovereign Host]],\nthe Path of Inspiration and its tight control of social\norder might bear more than a passing resemblance to\nthe Church of the [[Silver Flame]], though followers of that\nlatter religion find little cause for comparison. For followers of the Path of Inspiration, the Silver Flame and the Sovereign Host are nearly the same. [[Riedrans]] believe\nthe faiths of other cultures all worship dark spirits, or\n//altavars//—[[fiend]]s that corrupt all about them for the sake\nof power, be it material, arcane, or divine.\n\nThe massive monoliths ([[hanbalani alta]]s, or \"sanctuaries for the soul\") that dot the [[Sarlona]]n landscape are the most overt symbols of the Path of Inspiration. To the\n[[Riedrans]] who build the monoliths, they are temporary resting places for the souls of the dead—tombs that prepare the dead for movement into the next life. Those who\nknow the [[Inspired]] understand a much darker truth.\n\n!! Social Hierarchy of Humanoids\n\nUnder the precepts of the Path of Inspiration, the races of [[Sarlona]] are each seen\nto occupy a specific niche. At the top of the social order\nare the [[Inspired]]—beings blessed by grace and as close to\nenlightenment as mortals can be. Beneath them are the\n[[Chosen]], with Riedran [[human]]s below them. The Path of\nInspiration marks all nonhuman races by their degree\nof spiritual evolution, and [[Riedrans]] accept this. Thus,\n[[ogre]]s and [[shifter]]s are subhuman, while [[changeling]]s are\nacknowledged as superior and singularly blessed.\n\n!! The Path and the Quori\n\nNo [[Inspired]] views the Path of Inspiration as a true religion; it is merely a\ntool. [[Cleric|cleric]]s among the [[quori]] worship [[il-Lashtavar]].\nAside from the quori, only the shadow\nlines—those [[Chosen]] specifically\nraised to serve as vessels for the\nagents of the [[Dreaming Dark]]—know\nof this faith. \n\nAlthough the Path of Inspiration was created as a tool to manipulate the masses,\nnothing is inherently evil about the faith.\nThe divine power of the path is ultimately independent of the Inspired or\nthe Dreaming Dark. Perhaps spells of\nthe [[Riedran|Riedrans]] [[cleric]] are drawn from the\nmagical energy of the [[Dragon Above|Siberys]].\nMaybe the power flows from the raw\nfaith of millions of Riedrans. It could\nbe that the //il-altas// truly exist, unbeknownst to the Inspired. For most\n[[Riedrans]], the Path of Inspiration\nis inseparable from their country as\na whole, and the source of its power\nis [[Riedra]]. ",
