type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Exclusively nocturnal, these unusual sharks lurk near busy shipping lanes in the [[Sea of Rage]] near [[Rhiavhaar]] in order to hunt their favored prey: mariners. Possessing a pair of massive eyes that produce an effect similar to the [[light]] spell, the lighthouse shark lives near reefs and lures unwary ships close to wreck upon them. Their eyes stay active for weeks after their deaths, making them useful as lanterns.
