        "text": "The Battle of the Three Moons was a vicious conflict that occurred in the disputed territory between [[Breland]], [[Darguun]], and [[Cyre]] late in the [[Last War]]. The battle began on the evening of [[Barrakas 20th, 990 YK|Khorvaire calendar]], when a Darguul troop and a Brelish army launched a surprise attack on a Cyran encampment (commanded by General Bail ir'Dalas). However, the Darguuls had failed to account for the presence of several [[Valenar]] [[warband]]s. While the [[elves|elf]] were not allied with the Cyrans, they saw more sport in fighting the larger force. The battle lasted for four days, with the worst of the fighting occurring at night; fortunately for the [[human]]s and [[elves|elf]], the unusual conjunction of three of [[Eberron]]'s [[moon]]s provided enough light for those without [[darkvision]] to match their [[goblinoid]] foes.",
