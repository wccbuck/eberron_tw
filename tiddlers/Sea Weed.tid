The “village” of Sea Weed is a criminal haven of the oddest
sort. It has no fixed location. Rather, the community consists of several dozen ships and barges, lashed together and bridged to form a network of walkways and surfaces. Here,
vendors can set up stalls, pirates can sell their wares, and
deals can be made, all without outside interference. The
bridges and ties are designed to be cut away at a moment’s
notice, allowing the ships to scatter in all directions at the
approach of a naval force or other threat. At each assembly, the ship captains agree on their next location—telling few if any of their crew—ensuring that they can gather
again and continue business as usual.
