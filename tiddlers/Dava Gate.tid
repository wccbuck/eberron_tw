Dava Gate is a quiet district where professional
services outnumber trades. Architects and cartographers, barristers and sages, healers and fortunetellers all coexist in Dava Gate's small business
parks. These clusters of professionals are sometimes
themed by the type of service offeredâ€”for example,
one floor of Calsin Tower includes a number of
services devoted to animals: an animal trainer, a
kennel, a mews, a stable, and a veterinarian.
