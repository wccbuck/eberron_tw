You possess the [[Mark of Healing]], a [[dragonmark]] that only manifests on [[halfling]]s with ties to House [[Jorasco]]. As a result, you can operate [[dragonmark focus item]]s tied to your dragonmark, and can cast one spell (cantrip or common [[spell tier]]) from the below list. //Recommended Spell: [[cure wounds]].//

If your character is following the path of the [[nosomatic chirurgeon]], you may add disease-based and harm-based spells to your dragonmark spell list, such as [[contagion]], [[inflict wounds]], and [[vampiric touch]].

If you take this talent multiple times, you may choose additional spells from the below list, following the same rules as [[Spellcaster (talent)]].
