Skysedge Park is Sharn's only park district, though
[[Shae Lias]] (in [[Upper Northedge]]) is similar in some
ways. Here, three large parks occupy the top floors of
some of the largest towersâ€”grass and trees grow in a
deep layer of earth atop the towers, artificial ponds
carved into the surface shimmer invitingly, and the
noises of the city are magically dampened.

The population of Skysedge Park includes a
small minority (around 400 people) of immigrants
from the [[Eldeen Reaches]], struggling to maintain
something like their traditional lifestyle in a city
that defies the encroachment of nature.

!! Noteworthy Locations

* [[Skysedge Park (park)]]. The largest of the three parks in this district gave its name to the whole district.
* The [[Gatehouse]]. This small stone building is a sacred site to the sect of [[druid]]s known as the [[Gatekeepers]].
