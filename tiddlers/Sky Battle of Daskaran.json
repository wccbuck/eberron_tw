This ﬁrst aerial battle occurred between the Sky Knights of [[Aundair]] and the Wyvernriders of [[Thrane]]. The conﬂict was watched from the parapets of [[Daskaran]]\nand fought across a vast expanse of sky. Many [[wyvern]]s, [[dragonhawk]]s, and their riders plummeted to their death, and both sides claimed victory. Because the riders came from aristocrats on both sides, the battle became a symbol of the chivalry\nand honorable combat lost later in the war.",
