Kellan is a hero of folklore whose exploits are told to children across the [[Five Nations]]. Kellan was said to have been a knight of [[Galifar]], in the region that is now [[Aundair]]. He patrolled the edge of the great [[forest of the west|Towering Wood]], and in the process he fought many monsters. According to legend, he occasionally found himself in the [[plane]] of [[Thelanis]], where he pitted both blade and cunning against the [[fey]]. In one story, Kellan climbs the Tower of Thorns by slaying an [[ogre]] and using its ribcage as a ladder.
