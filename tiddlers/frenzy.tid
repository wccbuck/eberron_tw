A faint white mist fills a 60-foot radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 120 feet, and persists for up to 1 minute. The area becomes lightly obscured for the duration, and each creature within the area must resist your enchantment or else fly into a destructive rage towards all other nearby creatures and objects until the cloud disperses. The enchantment also greatly suppresses rational thinking for the duration.
