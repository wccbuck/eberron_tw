        "text": "The Guardians of the Gate is a special division of the [[Sharn Watch]], established during the [[Last War]] to monitor the activities of foreign nationals and immigrants. Their duties have expanded since\nthe surge of refugees into [[Sharn]] following the [[Mourning]], and the Guardians of the Gate closely supervise the\ndistrict of [[High Walls]]. The Guardians are chosen from among the best soldiers of the Watch and are devoted to their city. Many of them, however, place the safety of the\ncity ahead of strict adherence to the law, and complaints\nare raised against them from time to time for unnecessary violence against refugees. \n\nWhile the majority of the Guardians are military personnel, the agency also includes a corps of scribes and administrators who handle immigration issues and special customs investigations.\n\nThe headquarters of the [[Guardians of the Gate]] is in the [[Black Arch]] district of [[Lower Tavick's Landing]]. Captain [[Daja Brel]] commands the Guardians, assisted by Lieutenant [[Kestran Dal]]. The senior official of the civilian staff is [[Tethyn Olar]], and the top investigator is [[Six]].",
