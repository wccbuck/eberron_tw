Their duties have expanded since\nthe surge of refugees into [[Sharn]] following the [[Mourning]], and the Guardians of the Gate closely supervise the\ndistrict of [[High Walls]]. The Guardians are chosen from among the best soldiers of the Watch and are devoted to their city. Many of them, however, place the safety of the\ncity ahead of strict adherence to the law, and complaints\nare raised against them from time to time for unnecessary violence against refugees. \n\nCaptain [[Daja Brel]] commands the Guardians of the Gate.",
