In the 4E adventure "The Mark of Prophecy", Lord [[Bren ir'Gadden]] and his aide [[Aric Blacktree]] are captured, and the PCs are tasked with rescuing the nobleman. It is later revealed that Aric orchestrated the capture in order to imbue himself with a mysterious power, which manifests years later as an [[aberrant dragonmark]]. Aric then attempts to create an [[eldritch machine]] in his townhome in [[Center Bridge]], [[Menthis Plateau]], [[Sharn]], hiring the [[Red Jackals]] as bodyguards. His machine is set to destroy much of the plateau. It is up to the GM what Aric's motivations and connections are.
