        "text": "Countess Tesyn ir'Lantar is the matriarch of the illustrious ir'Lantar family of [[Aundair]]. The charming countess has a way of making those around her at ease, unless she\nis put out. Her reputation as a powerful [[warlock]] has served to keep her family safe. \n\nHistory states that the ir’Lantars are old blood in\n[[Fairhaven]], but few accounts of how the family rose to\ncount among the nobility are told. They descend from\na noble knight, Kael Lantar, who rose up after the fall\nof the lord he served. That lord is largely forgotten, the infamy of his deeds making him unworthy of remembrance. Since then, though, the ir’Lantars have ever\nascended on “noble” deeds until they sat just to the\nright of the royal throne.\n\nEverything the family has gained, from the dark root of Kael Lantar, is due to its ties to the [[Lords of Dust]]. The thick veneer of nobility and civil service hides a rotten core. Each and every member, servants included, is cruel and calculating at heart, but careful in deed.\n\nCountess Tesyn is no different. To outsiders, her\nlife is beyond reproach. The only complaint some\nnobles have is that she is a widow and has never\nremarried. Those who discover her connection to\nany crimes are skilled indeed, more so if they ever\nmanage to cut through the layers of obfuscation she\nhas erected to confront her. Few survive that long,\nand none have survived Tesyn’s ire unleashed.\n\nThe countess keeps her personal retinue of bodyguards close about her and her late husband’s mother, [[Ilsya|Ilsya ir'Lantar]].",
