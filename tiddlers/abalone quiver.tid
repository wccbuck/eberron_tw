title: abalone quiver
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This magical quiver is made from the shell of an enormous mollusk. Arrows you pull from it are considered magical, and are coated with a pearlescent, hydrophobic coating. Firing these arrows underwater causes them to cut through the water like torpedoes, without the ordinary resistance. These arrows become nonmagical once they hit a target or are held by a creature other than you.
