title: acidic twine
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This spool of pure white twine seems completely ordinary to an untrained eye. When a piece of this twine is cut free, it begins to excrete a potent acid for 1 minute. This acid will eat through flesh and even most metals. A new spool contains 20 feet of twine.
