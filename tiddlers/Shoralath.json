        "text": "The [[du'ulora]] champion Lord Shoralath commands\n[[Kintam Ulakhun]], the great fortress that watches [[Kasshta Keep]] from the edge of [[Syrkarn]]. Shoralath has commanded this front since the war beganâ€”he was present at\nthe first disastrous siege of Kasshta, and he still thirsts\nfor vengeance. Shoralath is a cruel being who takes great\npleasure in torturing his foes, both on the battlefield\nand in his dungeons. The [[kalashtar]] and agents of the\n[[Summit Road]] who fall into his hands suffer for weeks\nbefore being allowed to die. While the tortures Shoralath\ndevises are horrifying, this obsession could provide the\ntime rescuers need to liberate a prisoner, or it could give\nprisoners time to devise a plan of escape.\n\nAlthough cruel to his foes, Shoralath treats his troops\nwell and is loved by his soldiers. Many are disturbed by\nthe practice of torture, but most accept their lord's explanation that it is a necessary tool to purge the prisoners of the //altavars// that possess them. A few, however, are deeply\ntroubled by what they have seen, and these doubters could\ncome to the aid of prisoners in [[Kintam Ulakhun]]. ",
