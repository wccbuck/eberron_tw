You raise a [[holy symbol]] and speak a prayer of denunciation. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see that isn't immune to being frightened. Gain [[advantage]] if your target is a [[fiend]] or [[undead]]. If the target cannot resist your magic, it is stricken with fear, suffering [[disadvantage]] on all attempts as long as it can see you, and it is unable to willingly move from its spot. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until it suffers [[harm]].
