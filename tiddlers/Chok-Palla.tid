A chieftain of the [[Chuniigi]] Chok tribe, Chok-Palla
is desperate to find help battling the [[Kalaak]] raiders. One
of the few tribal leaders still trying to unite the struggling nation, he despairs that the conflict is wearing at
the very soul of the peopleâ€”turning tribe against tribe
as resources dwindle. Chok-Palla is actively seeking alliances with the southern [[shifter]] nations, the [[Icebinder|Icebinders]] [[frost giant]]s, and the lowland clans of the [[Dorann Holds]].
He also visits [[Whitetooth]] and [[Winterstead]] regularly,
seeking small bands of adventurers willing to scout the
[[Kalaak]] homeland in the [[Krertok Peninsula]].
