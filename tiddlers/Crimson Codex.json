For every answer, another riddle.”//\n<<<\n<div align=\"right\">—Ingrim Jarell, Prophet of the Crimson Codex</div>\n\nThe secret society known as the Crimson Codex has a twofold purpose—to study and manipulate the [[Draconic Prophecy]]. The organization’s ultimate goal is to\navoid another confrontation on the scale of the [[Last War]], reunite [[Galifar]], and return to a golden age of peace and enlightenment. The Codex believes that knowledge is by far the most powerful weapon, and that the Prophecy is the ultimate knowledge.\n\nTo that end, the Crimson Codex has a network of spies and informants within all major civilized governments of [[Khorvaire]]. This network ensures that treaties are upheld and peace remains a priority. Of the four factions pursuing the [[Caldyn Fragments]], the Codex has the strongest connection to the [[dragon]]s and their kin, even at times coordinating with agents of the [[Chamber]]. Like the [[greatwyrm]]s, the Codex is capable of waiting many years for plans to come to fruition.\n\nAlthough the Codex is a global operation with interests in each of [[Eberron]]’s continents, it continues to focus considerable resources in [[Xen'drik]] in pursuit of the ultimate prize: the potent knowledge contained in the [[Caldyn Fragments]].\n\nThe Codex does not publicly recruit new members in the manner of the [[Blackwheel Company]]. Instead, Codex operatives at every level of society constantly\nscout for new blood and like-minded souls. New members are never coerced into joining—endlessly patient, Codex recruiters know that the truth of their cause will ultimately persuade all who are meant to enter the Codex.\n\n!! Playing a Codex Operative\n\nTaking the name Crimson Codex after the tome\ncompiled by [[Ohnal Caldyn|Caldyn Fragments]], this group pledged to use\nthe [[Prophecy|Draconic Prophecy]], as well as the secrets locked away in the\ncontinent of [[Xen'drik]] and elsewhere, to reestablish\ncontrol over the events of [[Khorvaire]] and increase its\nmembers’ power throughout Eberron. In this way,\nthe ultimate goal of the Codex is lasting peace and a\nunified kingdom in Khorvaire through the study and\nmanipulation of the [[Draconic Prophecy]]. However,\nwhenever there is great power such as that held in the\nProphecy, there are people who would seek that power\nfor their own ends. \n\nThe [[Last War]] left Eberron on the brink of collapse.\nYou know that the tenuous [[Treaty of Thronehold]]\nmust not only be maintained, they must be built upon\nand expanded so that the traditions of [[Galifar]] can be\nrestored. Only with sustained peace can the pursuit of\nknowledge be furthered. You adventure not for fortune and glory, but for the very soul of Eberron.\n\nYou and your comrades in the Codex have determined, without a doubt, the source of ultimate knowledge. You know that the [[Prophecy|Draconic Prophecy]] is the ultimate and abiding reality. If this is the sole mystery that has\noccupied the great [[wyrms|dragon]] for time uncounted, what\ncould be more important? It is the Great Game, the\nessential riddle of the times.\n\nMany groups and factions vie for power in Eberron—churches and nations, houses and guilds, monsters and madmen. But only the Crimson Codex has the knowledge\nand the will to piece together the final puzzle. Wisdom\nis foresight. Knowledge is power.\n\nA notable member of the Codex in [[Stormreach]] is Professor [[Ingrim Jod Jarell]].",
