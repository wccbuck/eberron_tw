The adventures of [[Arien Grimbold]]! 

[[Mistmarsh]]

[[Old Session Prep]]

[[Future Adventure Prep]]

!! Session 7

Zarantyr 1 998 YK

We need another unity dinner scene with [[Lorsanna]] and [[Cadoc Belmin]]. Someone will say something about how half-elves need to stick together. Lorsanna might make a scene and leave, because Jholivei was a half elf, and her mission is fresh on her mind due to the arrival of Sejra. Belmin will express sympathies because of his own bitterness but believes community is the path to healing.

!!! Magic Items

Need to come up with cool [[magic item]]s to give to Arien.

!!! Fey Adventures

[[Dowin Lin Adredar]] is investigating these things

* Dyn Singh Night Market
* [[Old Man Cord]]
* Look up fairy/folk tales (specifically about artisans/makers) and make them Eberrony. 
** [[The Wonderful Toymaker|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Toymaker]]
*** [[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30400/30400-h/30400-h.htm#chap05]]
** [[The Elves and the Shoemaker|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elves_and_the_Shoemaker]]. This is about little folks ([[sprite]]s? [[pixie]]s?) helping out a craftsman and his family. This could be a chance for Arien to shrink down to mouse size like Alita very much wants her to do
** [[The Smith and the Devil|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smith_and_the_Devil]]
*** Could link this to [[Granny Nightshade|Skabatha Nightshade]]
* A note on the [[Assembly]]: "An [[artificer]] could have been blessed by the [[Forge Maiden]]; their artifice isn't arcane science, they simply create impossible, whimsical things."

!!! Second Semester Courses

Set up a [[progress clock]] for each of Arien's classes

!!!! Military

* Ethics/Leadership (taught by Prior [[Hemdoth Aggan]])
** Examine historical leaders like [[Galifar]] and [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]]. What traits do effective leaders exhibit?
** Skills: administrative, interpersonal, conceptual. Creating a vision. Resolving conflict.
** Path-goal theory of motivation. Overcoming obstacles:
*** Unclear Goals
*** Unclear Direction
*** Low Motivation
*** Complex Task
*** Simple Task
*** Low Involvement
*** Lack of Challenge
** [[Analects of War]]
** https://community.plu.edu/~kaurinpa/doc/syllabus-phil224.doc
* Wilderness Survival (maybe taught by Preceptor [[Cadoc Belmin]])
** Cadoc mentions serving in the Battle of [[Greenhaunt]] in 923 YK, at age 16. That would have been 75 years ago. Might also mention the legend of [[Horas Calt]].

!!!! Religion

* World Religions (taught by Master [[Marrath]])
** Specifics for Marrath’s outdated grammar opinions. They prefer irregular verbs: “Pleaded” should be “pled”, “dived” should be “dove”, “dwelled” should be “dwelt” (https://theenglishspace.com/grammar/glossary/irregular-verbs/unusual-irregular-verbs/) . But also, “an” instead of “a” before words that start with H, Verb-first questions like “Saw you that?” instead of “Did you see that?” Also they hate “progressive passive” sentence structure and prefers middle voice / passival. So “I was being trained” -> “I was training”. Other sentences like “The clothes were soaking” make sense in modern language, as opposed to the progressive passive “The clothes were being soaked”. But to Marrath, even sentences like “The house is being built” should be “The house is building”. “The meal is being eaten” should be “The meal is eating”. 
** [[Silver Flame]]
*** “everyone knows that in the dawn of time, demons ruled the world, the Sovereigns fought them, and the demons were bound by the Silver Flame. Because of this, some Vassals actually believe the Sovereigns created the Silver Flame—it’s just the light of Dol Arrah, and templars are fools for not seeing this.“
** [[Blood of Vol]]
** [[Undying Court]]
** [[Spirits of the Past]]
** [[Path of Inspiration]]
** [[druid]]ic faiths
** [[Cults of the Dragon Below]]
* Bestiary/Practical Theology (taught by Visitant [[Sejra Whitebinder]])
** Monsters/fiends and their weaknesses
** How to use one's divine gifts to directly combat evil
** Sejra speaks about her own religious philosophy
* Domains of Faith (taught by Master Vasiraghi (human))
** [[Light Domain]]
** [[War Domain]]
** [[Peace Domain]]
** [[Life Domain]]
** [[Order Domain]]
** [[Knowledge Domain]]
** [[Forge Domain]]

!! Scenes

[Todo]

!!! Zarantyr

* The arrival of [[Sejra Whitebinder]]
** Need to think about how to fit her story into the timeline, where in Breland "Ravan-Eth" was discovered and bound. Could connect that to what happened with [[Lorsanna]], maybe the wizard Ulros Jholivei somehow pulled in a demon from [[Shavarath]] and Sejra was the one who rebound it. Let's say Ravan-Eth was a [[vrock]].
* Training: [[crossbow]]s. Arien trains with a [[SAC-12]], manufactured right there in [[Starilaskur]].

!!! Olarune

Classes start. (scene 1/4)

* Leadership
* Survival
* World Religions
* Bestiary
* Domains of Faith

Other scenes

* Olarune 20: [[Day of Mourning]] (4th anniversary)
** Many Cyran refugees in or near [[Starilaskur]], make this a thing. Maybe even the [[Mourning Dawn]] mounts a terrorist attack on a [[Cannith]] foundry? Or just protests, damaged property. Maybe Arien has to keep the crowd calm.

!!! Therendor

Classes scene 2/4

* Leadership
* Survival
* World Religions
* Bestiary
* Domains of Faith

Other scenes

* Could have a training scene with a [[Cannith crossbow]], perhaps a gift from [[Haldon d'Cannith]] after calming the riot last month.
* Dyn Singh Night Market with [[Dowin Lin Adredar]]?
* Therendor 15: [[Sun's Blessing]]
** Definitely do something for this day, it's also the anniversary of Thrane's big attack on Starilaskur

!!! Nymm

In [[Nymm]] (June), it's going to be runnelberry season. There's going to be a harvest soon, in the freshwater marshes that lead to [[Lake Brey]], but some hostile creature is preventing that; go investigate. Twist: An agent of [[Balinor's Blessed]] (House [[Vadalis]]) wants to capture the creature and bring it to a Vadalis [[enclave]]. Could be exported to the [[Hearth]], or just sent to a local enclave: call it "Myrifen Ranch". He uses [[darts of tracking]].

* creature is jungle [[ankheg]], creature tier 3. 
* When Arien goes out into the Runnels to investigate, describe the [[storm spire]]s which [[Lyrandar]] uses to control the weather

Eventually, Arien (and the other novices) must embark on different quests to fight monsters or investigate trouble around the city

Some details about [[Breland]]'s nobility and view of the crown, which colors how the Martial Temple teaches the [[Oath of the Crown]]:

<<<
While [[Breland]] accepted the feudal structure of [[Galifar]], its people never fully embraced the nobility. A Brelish farmer sees themselves as the equal of any king; they accepted that the nobles had the //power//, but never bought into romantic ideals of divine bloodlines. This was tied to the fact that Breland was an active frontier. When Galifar was formed, the lands west of the Dagger were still home to ogres and gnolls, and goblins and gnomes held the lands to the east. [[Zilargo]] was quickly incorporated into the united kingdom, but it took centuries for Breland to achieve its current borders. The shield lords of the west were far more practical than the grand lords of [[Aundair]]. The common folk relied on the nobles to direct military action and to bring the resources of the crown to bear, while the lords relied on the people to be more self-directed than in other nations; Brelish communities chose their own reeves and lesser officials, and even simple matters of justice would be resolved by the people instead of going to the courts.
<<<

From 5e PHB:

<<<
Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when they reach (some level), is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some people on this path don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached this level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.
<<<

From Faiths of Eberron:

<<<
Dol Arrah is the light, not only of the sun, but of the best aspects of the mortal soul. She is the Sovereign of honor, forthrightness, and self-sacrifice. Dol Arrah is the patron of paladins, diplomats, and all who seek justice, and warriors who fight with wisdom and honor as much as with weapons. To a lesser extent, she is also the patron of explorers, who bring the light of knowledge to dark places, and to all who revere the sun. She aids [[Arawai]] by lighting her way during the growing season.

[Students of the [[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]]] must have the highest integrity. Many were warriors, diplomats, or law officers before joining. In all cases, they are people of sterling reputation.

Dol Arrah's devoted quest to bring peace to warring factions, to expose deceptions, to aid soldiers fighting for justice, and to defend the helpless against invaders.

Dol Arrah's shrines have large east-facing windows, to let in the light of the dawn.

Symbol: A rising sun, or the Octogram in bright yellow-gold and white, representing light and purity.
