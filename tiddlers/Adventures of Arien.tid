The adventures of [[Arien Grimbold]]!

[[Mistmarsh]]

[[Old Session Prep]]

Don't forget that Arien served at [[Sterngate]] and would be familiar with Captain Toris who leads that fort - a [[changeling]] who hates [[goblinoid]]s

!! Session 4

The buildings of the Martial Temple include: 

* church
* dormitory(ies)
* cloister (open square with covered walks; some training is done here)
* refectory (dining room)
* school + library
* balneary (bathhouse)
* infirmary
* palaestra (training area / combat school)

Arien meets with Preceptor [[Cadoc Belmin]] and Prior [[Hemdoth Aggan]]. At one point Belmin asks, "So you served at [[Sterngate]]? Under Captain Toris?" (Arien did.) Belmin is familiar with Toris, and how brutal she can be.

(Is there a chivalric order associated with the school? "Order of the Dawn Chorus" maybe?)

People:

* Head of the school: Preceptor [[Cadoc Belmin]]
** Middle-aged [[half-elf]] fella
** Eventually introduces Arien to the Khoravar idea of "the bridge between". Introduce Khoravar unity dinners
** [[Oath of the Crown]]
* Second-in-command: Prior [[Hemdoth Aggan]]
** [[Order Domain]]
* Mentor: Novice Master [[Wroenna Lonn]]
** human lady, very strong and tall. Think Brienne of Tarth
** [[Oath of Devotion]]
** Her heart glows so bright you can see it through her shirt
* Visitant [[Sejra Whitebinder]]
** Visiting teacher ("visitant" can mean "guest", or also "pilgrim"). Definitely a maverick, goes off and does her own thing
** [[War Domain]] cleric
** Friction between her and the leadership of the Martial Temple. The Preceptor/Prior etc are running the school in a way that advances the interests of [[Breland]]. Sejra believes that the temple should focus more on spiritual warfare against forces of great evil, irrespective of nationality.
* [name]
** A [[warlock]] of an [[archfey]] who is part of the [[Guild of Starlight and Shadows]] who creates illusions and conjures creatures for the purposes of training the novices. 

Other students: 

* Note: There are about fifty other students at the school, called novices, and they each have varying degrees of divine potential. Some merely exhibited divine power at a moment of crisis but can't manifest it at will. At least one of those is currently in the infirmary in a coma after one such manifestation. Other folks can manifest powers but with across a wide variety of magical effectsâ€”some utilitarian, some social, some combat-oriented. Others were priests once but began to exhibit miraculous powers beyond that of the standard [[adept]]. 
* Moody [[Oath of Vengeance]] guy
* Douchey [[Oath of Glory]] guy
* [[Light Domain]] cleric
** A priest who didn't start manifesting divine magic until late in life
* [[Knowledge Domain]] cleric currently in the infirmary in a coma
* [[Peace Domain]] cleric

The Martial Temple includes a school. Classes are very hard, with a lot of work; very little free time. 

Courses offered:

* Vassal History
* World Religions
* Practical Theology
* Vassal Art and Theater
* Leadership

* Military History
* Ethics in War
* Paladin Oaths
** [[Oath of Devotion]]

** [[Oath of Glory]]
** [[Oath of Redemption]]
** [[Oath of Vengeance]]
** [[Oath of the Ancients]]
* Domains of Faith
** [[Light Domain]]
** [[War Domain]]
** [[Peace Domain]]
** [[Life Domain]]
** [[Order Domain]]
** [[Knowledge Domain]]
** [[Forge Domain]]

Also: Physical training. Much of this is mundane, with workout rooms, obstacle courses, and also training with different weapons wearing padded armor. Archery, swordplay, hand-to-hand, etc. Some of this training is devotional, including focusing and honing Arien's faith in her own ideals. Mechanically this is done by [[boost]]ing using Heart.

There is an illusionist [[wizard]] ([[Guild of Starlight and Shadows]], [[warlock]] of an [[archfey]]) on staff who can create virtual training grounds. After all, this school is well-funded by the Brelish government

Eventually, Arien (and the other novices) must embark on different quests to fight monsters or investigate trouble around the city

Some details about [[Breland]]'s nobility and view of the crown, which colors how the Martial Temple teaches the [[Oath of the Crown]]:

<<<
While [[Breland]] accepted the feudal structure of [[Galifar]], its people never fully embraced the nobility. A Brelish farmer sees themselves as the equal of any king; they accepted that the nobles had the //power//, but never bought into romantic ideals of divine bloodlines. This was tied to the fact that Breland was an active frontier. When Galifar was formed, the lands west of the Dagger were still home to ogres and gnolls, and goblins and gnomes held the lands to the east. [[Zilargo]] was quickly incorporated into the united kingdom, but it took centuries for Breland to achieve its current borders. The shield lords of the west were far more practical than the grand lords of [[Aundair]]. The common folk relied on the nobles to direct military action and to bring the resources of the crown to bear, while the lords relied on the people to be more self-directed than in other nations; Brelish communities chose their own reeves and lesser officials, and even simple matters of justice would be resolved by the people instead of going to the courts.

From 5e PHB:

<<<
Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit
the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active
path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken
when they reach (some level), is the culmination
of all the paladin's training. Some people on this path don't consider themselves true paladins until
they have reached this level and made this oath. For
others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality,
an official stamp on what has always been true in the
paladin's heart.

From Faiths of Eberron:

<<<
Dol Arrah is the light, not only of the sun, but of the best aspects of the mortal soul. She is the Sovereign of honor, forthrightness, and self-sacrifice. Dol Arrah is the patron of paladins, diplomats, and all who seek justice, and warriors who fight with wisdom and honor as much as with weapons. To a lesser extent, she is also the patron of explorers, who bring the light of knowledge to dark places, and to all who revere the sun. She aids [[Arawai]] by lighting her way during the growing season.

[Students of the [[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]]] must have the highest integrity. Many were warriors, diplomats, or law officers before joining. In all cases, they are people of sterling reputation.

Dol Arrah's devoted quest to bring peace to warring factions, to expose deceptions, to aid soldiers fighting for justice, and to defend the helpless against invaders.

Dol Arrah's shrines have large east-facing windows, to let in the light of the dawn. 

Symbol: A rising sun, or the Octogram in bright yellow-gold and white, representing light and purity.
