!!! TODO

* Finish Dinsiin adventure
* Find a way to include Kupo the [[couatl]] more. Maybe he helps during Dinsiin adventure?
* When does [[Argonth]] move across the country? Could be a scene where they watch it go

!!! Magic Items

Need to come up with cool [[magic item]]s to give to Arien.

Just a nice-quality common-[[rarity]] sword made by Starilaskur Arms that self-cleans?

Some fun fey options:

* [[hinderling sword]]
* [[ring of alarm]] in shrink adventure
* Maybe [[jolly oozebeans]] in Dinsiin

[[Dowin Lin Adredar]] is investigating these things

* [[Dinsiin Night Market|Dinsiin (Dyn Singh) Night Market adventure notes]]
* [[Old Man Cord]]
* Look up fairy/folk tales (specifically about artisans/makers) and make them Eberrony. 
** [[The Wonderful Toymaker|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Toymaker]]
*** [[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30400/30400-h/30400-h.htm#chap05]]
*** This is [[Granny Nightshade|Skabatha Nightshade]]
** [[The Elves and the Shoemaker|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elves_and_the_Shoemaker]]. This is about little folks ([[sprite]]s? [[pixie]]s?) helping out a craftsman and his family (the Colworn family). This could be a chance for Arien to shrink down to mouse size like Alita very much wants her to do (need help from the [[Guild of Starlight and Shadows]] to shrink to mouse size)
*** Some kind of little fey that likes to tinker? Could just be [[pixies|pixie]]
*** Or, do something with [[brigganock]]s. They're little craftsmen/architects; focus on this element, not so much the mining element
**** Names: Trig, Zarli, Oyla, Golmo, Obud (lives in a hut on a pony named Keg, lowers a rope ladder to get down from the saddle straps), Pim, Zwee
*** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinzelm%C3%A4nnchen
*** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownie_(folklore)
*** Household spirit, helps with chores, but can be a nuisance if offended; can be disposed of by giving a new set of clothing (they resent this).
*** Brownies are kind of exactly what I want, but I don't know about the name. The Scottish Gaelic names for them just mean "brown" and "hairy". However, if I plug in "brown" into the [[Tolkien elvish dictionary|https://www.elfdict.com/w/brown?include_old=1]], one of the entries is "varne"; so what about "varney"? Other names: Fenodyree ("fenAH-theree", "fenOH-theree")
*** Perhaps a family once had some little fey in their house that would help them make their [insert item here]. They made little clothes for them, after which the fey left. (like the story.) Maybe the fey also took some expensive tools with them. They ask Arien to help them talk to the fey and apologize for the offense, try to make them come back. Arien shrinks down to mouse size and finds the fey. Turns out, they loved the clothes, but some OTHER issue is taking their attention which is why they left. Arien helps them with this. Or, they did hate the clothes, and that gift and the ensuing resentment sparked a different issue:
**** The fey made a set of automatons ("autovarneys"? "autobrigganocks"?) to do THEIR chores for them because they got lazy, but now the automatons are out of control (sorcerer's apprentice style). Use [[clockwork]]s for inspiration
*** [[ring of alarm]]. The spell [[alarm]] doesn't work on creatures smaller than a rat. THIS is why she needs to shrink down. At the end of the quest she can keep the ring
*** Could be that [[Snarik the Mauve]] is to blame for some invention that caused this problem, and now he wants help fixing it. He's the one that shrinks down Arien and Dowin (and maybe [[Ervol]] as well). So the little fey got offended because the family (the Colworns) accidentally left out spoiled milk. They went to Snarik for help, and he said to leave them a gift, but do NOT leave them clothing! (Or he at least THINKS he told them not to leave them clothing... surely he did. Wait... hmm, maybe not). So Mrs. Colworn knit little caps and sweaters for the fey, which they hated, and they left. The family went back to Snarik, who made them little automatons, but the resentful fey claimed them for themselves so they wouldn't have to do their own chores. Every time the Colworns try to go into the shed where the fey/constructs dwell, they vanish (it's because of the [[alarm]]) so that's why the party needs to get small
*** The fey have "lost their motivation" and have gotten lazy and fat, the automatons do everything for them. Party has to literally find the motivation, which is being guarded by the head automaton.
*** Other possible threats:
**** An alchemy table covered with random unfinished magical potions, [[random magical effect]] when they're spilled
**** Check Michael Crichton's list of action sequences in Micro (https://www.michaelcrichton.com/micro/). Good ones include being carried away by ants, encountering [[bombadier beetles|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_beetle]], falling from a great height (but they're fine because they basically have [[feather fall]]), spiders/webs

** [[The Smith and the Devil|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smith_and_the_Devil]]
*** Could link this to [[Granny Nightshade|Skabatha Nightshade]]/Wonderful Toymaker
* A note on the [[Assembly]]: "An [[artificer]] could have been blessed by the [[Forge Maiden]]; their artifice isn't arcane science, they simply create impossible, whimsical things."
* From WBtWL: A tiny [[clockwork]] toad that hops and croaks when placed on the ground. If any creature licks the toad, all other creatures are invisible to that creature for 1 hour.

* Leadership (Prior [[Hemdoth Aggan]])
** When assuming the responsibilities of command, we must consider the three-way moral problem: the mission, vs. the risks to soldiers, vs. the risk to innocent civilians. The [[Treaty of Thronehold]], as well as our consciences, obligate us not to harm innocent non-combatants. Sometimes, the most important consideration will be the greater good for the whole. At other times, the //principle// cannot be compromised. And sometimes, the primary consideration will be, "Can I, and the soldiers under my command, live with this decision?"
** Do not forget that you are touched by the divine. Your faith has allowed you to create miracles. Even if you don't feel a close connection to [[Dol Arrah]]: meditate on her, invoke her, beseech her. She is the Sovereign of Wisdom in War. She will help you find the honorable, just decision. Sometimes this moment of reflection and prayer will open your eyes to things you've been blinded to. Your training makes you stronger but it also shapes your expectations, and in times of chaos, sometimes we only see what we expect to see. Let Dol Arrah cut through the darkness and reveal the situation to you as it truly is.
** Study the [[Treaty of Thronehold]] and what it says about protection of prisoners of war, protection of civilians, and treatment of the wounded
* Survival (Preceptor [[Cadoc Belmin]])
** "Some wild places are touched by the [[fey]]; for example, the [[Greenhaunt]] is closely tied to the [[Endless Weald]] of [[Thelanis]]. If you are trying to survive in such lands, you had better stay on the good side of the [[Forest Queen]] and her agents. Don't kill beasts with magic or for sport; honor any [[fey]] who cross your path and offer assistance if they need it; and respect your environment. That's what served [[Horas Calt]], the infamous bandit king of the Whistling Woods; he had allies among the fey of the Greenhaunt, and that's largely why it took the [[Sentinel Marshals]] so many years to bring him down. Hell, it served me too, when I was sixteen during the Battle of Greenhaunt. [Note: That would have been 75 years ago.] If I didn't respect the forest, if I didn't beseech the [[firbolg]]s who protect it... we would have lost many more lives. ...Anyway. I'm off track."

** [[Cyre]], [[Darguun]], and [[Valenar]]. [[New Cyre]].
* World Religions (Master [[Marrath]])

* Bestiary (Visitant [[Sejra Whitebinder]])
** [[undead]]. Differentiate between "spontaneous undead" (which form in [[manifest zone]]s and during coterminous periods with [[Mabar]] and [[Dolurrh]]) vs undead created through the use of [[necromancy]]. Sejra says there's also [[deathless]], but they're an entirely different category and you won't typically be fighting them anyway.
*** Spontaneous undead (any of these can be created too):
**** [[ghoul]]s
**** [[ghost]]s
**** [[wight]]s
*** Created undead:
**** [[zombie]]s (though these can rarely spontaneously animate in Mabaran zones)
**** [[Karrnathi undead]]
**** [[vampire]]s
**** [[mummies|mummy]]
**** [[lich]]es

Other scenes

* Training: Ask Alita what Arien's focusing on? Is there a certain weapon, a certain technique she wants to improve specifically? Is she asking Swordbrother [[Farlay]] for any mentorship?
* Some folks are excited about the [[Dinsiin Night Market|Dinsiin (Dyn Singh) Night Market adventure notes]] coming back next month
* Scene where [[Sejra|Sejra Whitebinder]] is arguing with [[Cadoc Belmin]]
* Lunch with [[Dowin Lin Adredar]]. He says he met [[Snarik the Mauve]] who apparently caused some issue with one of his inventions. Sounds like an opportunity for an adventure, but first they need to buy a rare item (setting up Dinsiin, and also the shrink adventure).
** Snarik is making a "Metamorphic Spatial Condenser", and he needs a "Symphonious Gyroscopic Stabilizer" for it.
** Dowin is curious about Snarik's magic and wants to help in order to learn more about his particular brand of [[Sympathetic Theory]]. He says other members of the [[Guild of Starlight and Shadows]] have fascinating "magical thinking" style of artifice; one bakes mystical pies, another sews shadows together.
* Therendor 15: [[Sun's Blessing]]
** The Temple holds a big festival, celebrating peace. Folks from the other four nations are expressly invited to the celebration, as it is a time for enemies to set aside their differences and commune.
** However, it is also the anniversary of [[Thrane]]'s attack on [[Starilaskur]]. It was over eighty years ago, but many Brelish still curse Thrane on this day. So not many Thranish folks are in attendance.
** The city guard and a division of the [[Redcloak Battalion]] is here keeping an eye on the crowd due to the terrorist threat last month.
** The event includes various speakers, as well as a performance of ''Five Lives'', a bitter reflection on the tragedy of the [[Last War]], as seen through the eyes of five soldiers. Written by up-and-coming [[Sharn]] playwright [[Luca Syara]].
** A young, haughty [[Aundair]]ian [[eldritch knight]] of the [[Knights Arcane]] named Firmand challenges Arien to a duel. It's seen as poor taste since the holiday is supposed to celebrate peace, but the knight asserts this is just friendly competition.
*** Taunts Arien, saying how Aundair's martial capabilities vast exceed Breland's. How Aundair's [[wandslinger]]s far outstrip Breland's, and even their paladins are mightier. He says how absurd it is that Breland would be home to the Martial Temple of Dol Arrah; he laughs as he says it's ridiculous to think that the skeptical Brelish would have faith in anything other than cold hard cash.
*** He can cast [[booming blade]], [[shocking grasp]], and [[lightning lure]]. He also has [[Weapon Bond]].

Classes scene 3/4

* Leadership (Prior [[Hemdoth Aggan]])
** Case study: Leave No One Behind

<<<

One of the most difficult moral decisions of command is to what degree to uphold the code "Leave No One Behind". How many healthy soldiers will I risk to bring home one wounded (or dead) soldier?

You are in command of a platoon of soldiers, made up of five squads of eight soldiers. You are charged with a patrol mission along the edge of the [[Mournland]]. A thick fog rises, and you receive a report that one of your soldiers has gone missing. You send one of your squads to search for the missing soldier. Because of the thick fog, the squad and the main company will use bugles to communicate.

After one hour, the squad stops responding to bugle calls. 

All of your soldiers are well trained, ready to go in an instant, and eager to find their missing companions. Do you send in another search squad? If you send them, what will you do if they too go missing? Do you instead cut your losses? Regardless of your choice, how will you explain your choice to the families of the missing? Every second counts.

<<<

* Survival (Preceptor [[Cadoc Belmin]])
** "Survival thinking": will to survive, situational awareness, assessment, prioritization
** In times of extreme need, one's faith can reach new heights. As those touched by the divine, we can use our desperation to enhance our power, or gain new skills. Purifying water, creating food, overcoming a hazard, making a signal—any of these can be a gift of the divine in times of need.
* Politics of Khorvaire (Master Yonz (human))
** [[Thrane]] and the theocracy, [[Diani ir'Wynarn]] and the "blood regents" and the Throneholders who want to put her back in power. [[Thaliost]]. Present Thrane as an unstable nation on the verge of a possible rift.
* World Religions (Master [[Marrath]])
** [[Undying Court]] and [[Spirits of the Past]]
* Bestiary (Visitant [[Sejra Whitebinder]])
** [[therianthrope]]s. Mention [[silvered weapon]] as well as [[mithral]]
** [[Silver Crusade]]

Other scenes

* [[Dinsiin Night Market|Dinsiin (Dyn Singh) Night Market adventure notes]], possibly with [[Dowin Lin Adredar]]
* Have a conversation with [[Wroenna Lonn]] about oaths again, and this time, have her focus on what is Arien’s “war”. It’s okay if Arien doesn’t know.
* Shrink-down adventure with Dowin [WIP]
* [[Sejra Whitebinder]] tells Arien that an oath need not be such a sacrifice as long as it focuses one's faith. She says not everything needs to be a sacrifice; that's just a very [[Dol Arrah]] way of looking at the paladin's oath, but there are other paths.

!!! Dravago

Classes scene 4/4

* Leadership (Prior [[Hemdoth Aggan]])
** Case Study: Justice vs. Mercy.

<<<
You’re a commanding officer of a warship, and two soldiers have come to the captains mast for a non-judicial proceeding for the same offense. They were both on personal leave before the ship was scheduled to depart at 0800 on that particular morning. They were required to be aboard by 0700. However, they both took the same Orien carriage to the docks, which got stuck in traffic, and arrived at the pier 25 minutes after the ship departed. As captain, you have authority to decide their punishment.

The maximum punishment you can give at a non-judicial proceeding is:

* 45 days restriction (forbidden to leave the ship, extra duty after-hours)
* Forfeiture of ½ of one month’s pay for 3 months
* Reduction in rank one pay grade

The “standard” punishment for missing ship’s movement is:

* 30 days restriction
* Forfeiture of ½ of one month’s pay for 2 months
* If there was another mast offense in the last 12 months, reduction in rank

Profile of accused:

* Petty officer Barnaby: 24-year-old bachelor, known as a “wild man”. Has been to non-judicial proceedings twice in the last 3 years (charges of: disrespect towards a superior officer, and drunk and disorderly ashore). His division officer says he does a barely marginal job, and gets in trouble ashore frequently.
* Petty officer Goodman: 29 years old, married with 4 children, ages 1 month to 9 years. He has never been to captains mast. His division officer says he is extremely responsible and always does his job well. He also volunteers aboard ship tutoring sailors, and serves as the ship’s drug abuse counselor.

# What punishment do you give each sailor? Do you give them the same punishment, or different? Why?
# What were the considerations in your decision in order of priority?

* Survival (Preceptor [[Cadoc Belmin]])
** Field trip (do this scene last)
* Politics of Khorvaire (Master Yonz (human))
** [[Karrnath]] and [[Kaius ir'Wynarn III]]. How he was the one who called the summit that led to the [[Treaty of Thronehold]]. Learn about the history of the [[Blood of Vol]] within the region
** [[Aundair]] and the [[Eldeen Reaches]].
* World Religions (Master [[Marrath]])
** [[Path of Inspiration]], [[druid]]ic faiths, [[Cults of the Dragon Below]]
* Bestiary (Visitant [[Sejra Whitebinder]])
** some "common" [[monstrosities|monstrosity]] and [[aberration]]s

Survival class field trip. Each student has a [[pop-up tent]], [[explorer's pack]], [[herbalism kit]], and [[healer's kit]]. Goal is to survive in the wilderness for one week, but are only give 3 days rations. A [[Tharashk]] hunter is standing by to search for any novices who go missing. Perhaps each novice also has a flare that sends a mental ping to that hunter, if a novice is in danger.


Other scenes

* Swear the [[Oath of the Ancients]]
* Dravago 26: [[Aureon's Crown]]

!!! Nymm

In [[Nymm]] (June), it's going to be runnelberry season. There's going to be a harvest soon, in the freshwater marshes that lead to [[Lake Brey]], but some hostile creature is preventing that; go investigate. Twist: An agent of [[Balinor's Blessed]] (House [[Vadalis]]) wants to capture the creature and bring it to a Vadalis [[enclave]]. Could be exported to the [[Hearth]], or just sent to a local enclave: call it "Myrifen Ranch". He uses [[darts of tracking]].

* creature is jungle [[ankheg]], creature tier 3. 
* When Arien goes out into the Runnels to investigate, describe the [[storm spire]]s which [[Lyrandar]] uses to control the weather

Other scenes:

* Nymm 12: [[Brightblade]]. Do a scene with [[Roak]]. Perhaps he is going down a path of training with the Order of the [[Broken Blade]] and needs to forge his own sword; he wants to seek out ancient [[Dhakaan]]i daashor secrets for this. Could plant the seeds for an adventure in the [[Seawall Mountains]].

!!! Lharvion

* [[Old Man Cord]]?

!!! Barrakas

* The [[Hunt]]. Perhaps we meet up with that Vadalis guy.

Eventually, Arien (and the other novices) must embark on different quests to fight monsters or investigate trouble around the city

Some details about [[Breland]]'s nobility and view of the crown, which colors how the Martial Temple teaches the [[Oath of the Crown]]:

<<<
While [[Breland]] accepted the feudal structure of [[Galifar]], its people never fully embraced the nobility. A Brelish farmer sees themselves as the equal of any king; they accepted that the nobles had the //power//, but never bought into romantic ideals of divine bloodlines. This was tied to the fact that Breland was an active frontier. When Galifar was formed, the lands west of the Dagger were still home to ogres and gnolls, and goblins and gnomes held the lands to the east. [[Zilargo]] was quickly incorporated into the united kingdom, but it took centuries for Breland to achieve its current borders. The shield lords of the west were far more practical than the grand lords of [[Aundair]]. The common folk relied on the nobles to direct military action and to bring the resources of the crown to bear, while the lords relied on the people to be more self-directed than in other nations; Brelish communities chose their own reeves and lesser officials, and even simple matters of justice would be resolved by the people instead of going to the courts.
<<<

From 5e PHB:

<<<
Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when they reach (some level), is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some people on this path don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached this level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.
<<<

From Faiths of Eberron:

<<<
Dol Arrah is the light, not only of the sun, but of the best aspects of the mortal soul. She is the Sovereign of honor, forthrightness, and self-sacrifice. Dol Arrah is the patron of paladins, diplomats, and all who seek justice, and warriors who fight with wisdom and honor as much as with weapons. To a lesser extent, she is also the patron of explorers, who bring the light of knowledge to dark places, and to all who revere the sun. She aids [[Arawai]] by lighting her way during the growing season.

[Students of the [[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]]] must have the highest integrity. Many were warriors, diplomats, or law officers before joining. In all cases, they are people of sterling reputation.

Dol Arrah's devoted quest to bring peace to warring factions, to expose deceptions, to aid soldiers fighting for justice, and to defend the helpless against invaders.

Dol Arrah's shrines have large east-facing windows, to let in the light of the dawn.

Symbol: A rising sun, or the Octogram in bright yellow-gold and white, representing light and purity.
