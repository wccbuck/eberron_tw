The adventures of [[Arien Grimbold]]!

[[Mistmarsh]]

[[Old Session Prep]]

!! Session 3

Arien and [[Dowin Lin Adredar]] go to [[Dragon's Crown]] to investigate it

Make it to [[Heeson's Ferry]], get on the [[lightning rail]] to [[Starilaskur]]. Let's not do a lightning rail heist quite yet, save it for the second/third time Arien gets on the train.

Stuff that could happen on the lightning rail:

* A [[warforged]] quietly reads a book called //The Machine Manifesto//.
* A bored [[changeling]] child practices duplicating the faces of the guests. Not all of them are amused.
* A [[halfling]] leads a tiny pet dinosaur on a leash, tugging at it whenever it tries to examine something.
* A human pickpocket circulates among the passengers, looking for another victim.
* An older human reads the [[Korranberg Chronicle]], loudly proclaiming outrage at every story.

In [[Starilaskur]], make it to the Martial Temple of [[Dol Arrah]]. Meet folks there who train people who have been touched by [[divine magic]]. After a few introductory meetings and trainings, a mentor tells Arien about the oaths of a [[paladin]], and how these oaths strengthen and focus one's divine magic. Eventually they settle on [[Oath of the Ancients]] for her.

"Pray for peace, prepare for war"

Some details about [[Breland]]'s nobility and view of the crown, which colors how the Martial Temple teaches the [[Oath of the Crown]]:

<<<
While [[Breland]] accepted the feudal structure of [[Galifar]], its people never fully embraced the nobility. A Brelish farmer sees themselves as the equal of any king; they accepted that the nobles had the //power//, but never bought into romantic ideals of divine bloodlines. This was tied to the fact that Breland was an active frontier. When Galifar was formed, the lands west of the Dagger were still home to ogres and gnolls, and goblins and gnomes held the lands to the east. [[Zilargo]] was quickly incorporated into the united kingdom, but it took centuries for Breland to achieve its current borders. The shield lords of the west were far more practical than the grand lords of [[Aundair]]. The common folk relied on the nobles to direct military action and to bring the resources of the crown to bear, while the lords relied on the people to be more self-directed than in other nations; Brelish communities chose their own reeves and lesser officials, and even simple matters of justice would be resolved by the people instead of going to the courts.

From 5e PHB:

<<<
Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit
the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active
path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken
when they reach (some level), is the culmination
of all the paladin's training. Some people on this path don't consider themselves true paladins until
they have reached this level and made this oath. For
others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality,
an official stamp on what has always been true in the
paladin's heart.

From Faiths of Eberron:

<<<
Dol Arrah is the light, not only of the sun, but of the best aspects of the mortal soul. She is the Sovereign of honor, forthrightness, and self-sacrifice. Dol Arrah is the patron of paladins, diplomats, and all who seek justice, and warriors who fight with wisdom and honor as much as with weapons. To a lesser extent, she is also the patron of explorers, who bring the light of knowledge to dark places, and to all who revere the sun. She aids [[Arawai]] by lighting her way during the growing season.

[Students of the [[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]]] must have the highest integrity. Many were warriors, diplomats, or law officers before joining. In all cases, they are people of sterling reputation.

Dol Arrah's devoted quest to bring peace to warring factions, to expose deceptions, to aid soldiers fighting for justice, and to defend the helpless against invaders.

Dol Arrah's shrines have large east-facing windows, to let in the light of the dawn. 

Symbol: A rising sun, or the Octogram in bright yellow-gold and white, representing light and purity.
