The adventures of [[Arien Grimbold]]!

[[Mistmarsh]]

[[Old Session Prep]]


Have a scene about getting ready for Gatherhunt, helping the younger folks make baskets, lots of kids and folks asking Arien questions about her power etc. They consider her blessed by [[Dol Arrah]], and assume her faith in the Sovereigns is very great. Have a scene where a young [[goblin]] girl named Senen asks to see Arien [[produce flame]] or do some [[thaumaturgy]] effects. Have another scene in which a group of [[Cyran|Cyre]] refugees place their hands on Arien and pray to [[Dol Arrah]] to work through this chosen servant to bring a new dawn for [[Cyre]] and help them find a homeland.

Town makes a big goodbye for Arien. Folks line up to shake her hand as she boards the [[Lyrandar]] river boat (Joherra, the town reeve; Alben ir'Clarn, the sheriff; Reverend Ebinor. Her parents are there and give her a big hug). [[Windwrights Guild]] folks load up crates of magical acorns and crops from the surrounding area.

On the boat, meet a [[gnome]] scholar of some kind.

The journey to [[Heeson's Ferry]] takes three days, but Arien doesn't need to take those days sequentially (Her ticket is for Mistmarsh to [[Rutherton]], Rutherton to [[Nelview]], and Nelview to [[Heeson's Ferry]], and it gets punched each time. Each leg of the journey is 50-70 miles, and takes between 6 and 9 hours). Do some travel montage stuff, eventually arrive at [[Nelview]]. 

Do some cultist adventure with the [[Dragon's Crown]]. Folks in the town blame the [[Cyran|Cyre]]s in the poorer part of town.

From the [[Vale of the Inner Sun]] page:

<<<
After a path to the Inner Sun opens up near [[New Cyre]], a new cult rises among the Cyrans. A masked prophet urges his people to abandoned the doomed surface and start a new Galifar beneath the Inner Sun. Who will be willing to sacrifice their humanity for a new homeland, and what powers can they find in the depths: Could a terrifying new Cyre rise to avenge the old?
<<<

This could be really great; the [[Dragon's Crown]] could be a way to access the [[Vale of the Inner Sun]], or perhaps this masked prophet thinks fights should be conducted in the center of the ring to win glory for eventual ascendance into the Vale.

The cult has been kidnapping "strong" folk from the town, as well as capturing beasts from the surrounding area, to fight in the center of Dragon's Crown. This is to gain glory for the victors, who may then be chosen to inter the [[Vale of the Inner Sun]].

Masked leader is actually some form of [[undead]], a follower of [[Katashka]] who is harvesting souls for his own purposes. A quote he uses:

<<<
You cannot defeat me. You fear death, knowing your flesh will rot and your soul will shrivel away in [[Dolurrh]]. But I serve the Grim King, the Keeper of the Gateâ€”and even if you kill me now, he will open the gate for my return.
<<<

Make it to [[Heeson's Ferry]], get on the [[lightning rail]] to [[Starilaskur]]. Lightning rail heist???

In [[Starilaskur]], make it to the Martial Temple of [[Dol Arrah]]. Meet folks there who train people who have been touched by [[divine magic]]. After a few introductory meetings and trainings, a mentor tells Arien about the oaths of a [[paladin]], and how these oaths strengthen and focus one's divine magic. Eventually they settle on [[Oath of the Ancients]] for her.

[[Starilaskur]] quest: invisible [[boggle]]s are leading victims (children?) to an [[annis hag]].

As Arien's powers grow, the mentor/teachers at the Martial Temple are confused at the way her powers manifest, and come to believe that her power comes primarily from the [[Silver Flame]], not from [[Dol Arrah]]. So they recommend she travel to [[Thrane]] for training.

Eventually, she realizes her power comes from a [[celestial]] of [[Fernia]], whose physical form was destroyed 20 years ago, and a sliver of that angel's power landed in Arien's soul. This leads her to seek out other planetouched folks, which leads her to the town of [[Rellekor]]. Here she meets with learned [[tiefling]]s who can reveal more of what's going on. Maybe here she meets a tiefling named Zaben who was touched by a fragment of a Fernian fiend in the same way Arien was.
