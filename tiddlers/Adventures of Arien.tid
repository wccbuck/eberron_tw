!! Brainstorming

* Kupo should provide an occasional [[detect immortal]] or similar [[divination]] for Arien.

!! Session 12

!!! TODO

* Make a scene surrounding the swearing of the [[Oath of the Ancients]]. This happens on [[Aureon's Crown]], a traditional day for students to advance or graduate.
* Has Arien kept going to unity dinners, or is it a little awkward going to social events with the Preceptor? Has she made friends there? Has she picked up any [[Liotian]]?
** Names: Sovellom, Fellise, Paela
* When does [[Argonth]] move across the country? (see Brightblade discussion below)
* Runnelberry season adventure ([[A Menace in Runnelberry Dale]])
* Need to lay groundwork for an adventure in the [[Seven Caves]] (Hirot'zhaaraan? Hirot'jarluv?) or better, some abandoned Dhakaani fortress on the Brelish side of the [[Seawall Mountains]]. I like the idea that they could have to contend with a [[wyvern]] nest. Could take a lightning rail to [[Sterngate]], or go through [[New Cyre]]. Note that [[Marguul]] clans might still pop up, they don't necessarily respect the Darguun-Breland border and tend to populate caves on either side.

!!!! Brightblade

//Is this even interesting enough to run on its own? Or do we skip ahead to Mistmarsh Homecoming?//

Think about [[Brightblade]] scene/adventure; [[Roak]] will feature prominently.

Event ideas:

* Swimming/running, maybe canoe race
* Strongman contest: lifting heavy objects, breaking barriers, log tossing, tug-of-war
* Archery trickshots
* Eating contests?
* Obstacle course
* Boxing
* Wrestling
* Jousts
* Dueling (nonlethal)
* Weaponsmithing

Different events throughout the day and throughout the city; many events are held in Toperen Boulevard which is roped off to thru traffic, and others (canoeing?) are held on [[Lake Brey]]. In the evening, the [[Broken Blade]] monastery hosts the finals for wrestling, fencing, and a few other events (grand melee? team skirmish? king of the hill?), and holds an awards ceremony. I think [[Farlay]] for sure competes each year even though he's getting older.

It just so happens that [[Argonth]] is passing through the area in time for Brightblade. Or perhaps it's stopped, and folks from Argonth want to compete. Recall that Field Marshal [[Alain ir'Ranek]] is a viscount and does not submit to local authority.

* Could be some tension with [[warforged]] competitors. Are they allowed to compete? Do they have their own category? Perhaps [[Big Bara]] herself is competing.
** Warforged names: Patient, Cleese, Thunder

!!! Magic Items

* 

!! Scenes

!!! Dravago

* Scene at the crossroads meeting place to wrap up the survival challenge. Arien and Lorsanna have this Filge guy with them, definitely gotta explain that. Belmin is there, as is a [[Tharashk]] tracker
* Do a training roll for Dravago ([[Weapon Expertise]])
* Final Grades:
** Ethics and Leadership: A-
** Wilderness Survival: A+
** Politics of Khorvaire: B-
** World Religions: A+
** Bestiary: A-
* Swear the [[Oath of the Ancients]] on Dravago 26, [[Aureon's Crown]]. She swears her oath in the Grove of Promises (see [[Thelanis]] page), and her oath focuses on preserving light and life. This ties into how she was raised, as an attentive woodswarden; she is acutely aware of the delicate dance of preserving ecosystems. Also, Arien's mentor is assigned: [[Sejra Whitebinder]]. She will provide guidance, advice, and practical teachings, helping Arien navigate the complexities of her training and the challenges she encounters.
* Other folks also "graduate":
** [[Roak]] swears the [[Oath of Glory]]
** [[Turanank]] swears the [[Oath of Devotion]], learns [[dispel immortal]] from [[Sejra Whitebinder]]
** [[Ervol]] takes up the [[War Domain]]
** [[Lorsanna]] swears the [[Oath of Vengeance]]
* At her next unity dinner, the priest Fellise says a special toast to Arien and everyone congratulates her. Also Arien has picked up enough [[Liotian]] to be conversational!

!!! Nymm

* [[A Menace in Runnelberry Dale]]

* Nymm 12: [[Brightblade]]. See notes in  <<scrollToHeader "Brainstorming">>. But consider that this adventure doesn't serve much purpose in moving the narrative forward. We might instead skip to Mistmarsh homecoming adventure after Runnelberry Dale.

!!! Lharvion

* ~~[[Old Man Cord]]?~~
* Let's do <<navAndScrollToHeader "Future Adventure Prep" "Mistmarsh">> adventure ([[The Reavers of Harkenwold]])

!!! Barrakas

* The [[Hunt]]. Perhaps we meet up with that Vadalis agent from the ankheg adventure.
* Or, we just move on with the story and have Arien make plans to go to [[Sharn]]. See <<navAndScrollToHeader "Future Adventure Prep" "On the Way to Sharn">>.

!! Other Students

Names for other students:

* Verbane, Sandis, Teldovoor, Todrik, Cesaria, Ravinia

Eventually, Arien (and the other novices) must embark on different quests to fight monsters or investigate trouble around the city

Some details about [[Breland]]'s nobility and view of the crown, which colors how the Martial Temple teaches the [[Oath of the Crown]]:

<<<
While [[Breland]] accepted the feudal structure of [[Galifar]], its people never fully embraced the nobility. A Brelish farmer sees themselves as the equal of any king; they accepted that the nobles had the //power//, but never bought into romantic ideals of divine bloodlines. This was tied to the fact that Breland was an active frontier. When Galifar was formed, the lands west of the Dagger were still home to ogres and gnolls, and goblins and gnomes held the lands to the east. [[Zilargo]] was quickly incorporated into the united kingdom, but it took centuries for Breland to achieve its current borders. The shield lords of the west were far more practical than the grand lords of [[Aundair]]. The common folk relied on the nobles to direct military action and to bring the resources of the crown to bear, while the lords relied on the people to be more self-directed than in other nations; Brelish communities chose their own reeves and lesser officials, and even simple matters of justice would be resolved by the people instead of going to the courts.
<<<

From 5e PHB:

<<<
Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when they reach (some level), is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some people on this path don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached this level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.
<<<

From Faiths of Eberron:

<<<
Dol Arrah is the light, not only of the sun, but of the best aspects of the mortal soul. She is the Sovereign of honor, forthrightness, and self-sacrifice. Dol Arrah is the patron of paladins, diplomats, and all who seek justice, and warriors who fight with wisdom and honor as much as with weapons. To a lesser extent, she is also the patron of explorers, who bring the light of knowledge to dark places, and to all who revere the sun. She aids [[Arawai]] by lighting her way during the growing season.

[Students of the [[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]]] must have the highest integrity. Many were warriors, diplomats, or law officers before joining. In all cases, they are people of sterling reputation.

Dol Arrah's devoted quest to bring peace to warring factions, to expose deceptions, to aid soldiers fighting for justice, and to defend the helpless against invaders.

Dol Arrah's shrines have large east-facing windows, to let in the light of the dawn.

Symbol: A rising sun, or the Octogram in bright yellow-gold and white, representing light and purity.
