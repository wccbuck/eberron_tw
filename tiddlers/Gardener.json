He's a blend of [[angel]] and plantâ€”more\n[[humanoid]] than [[treant]], but with skin of bark, a beard of leaves,\nand a crown of flowers. Like all of the Architects, he's devoted\nto his planar seeds, but he also spends time wandering the\ngarden, both tending it and appreciating its wonders. He\nappreciates those who nurture and heal others, and this is\nthe behavior he expects of any mortals he associates with.",
