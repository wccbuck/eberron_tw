A mere nine [[night hag]]s dwell in the [[Demon Wastes]]. The hags
spend most of their time engaged in mystical studies beyond
the realm of mortal ken (and mercifully so), exploring the
ancient ruins for arcane tomes from the [[Age of Demons]].
Most of the night hags react with hostility when approached
by strangers, but a few can be dealt withâ€”provided the visitor has something to offer and minds her manners. The widely respected hag Kyrale serves as an ambassador and mediator among the [[fiend]]ish powers active in the Wastes, and mortals wishing to negotiate with the [[Lords of Dust]] or other fiends often seek her out to act as an intermediary.
