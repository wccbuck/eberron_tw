The secret garden of the\nLady is walled and protected by dangerous [[plant creature]]s,\nbut holds imaginary flowers that an [[alchemist]] could use to do\namazing things. The Lady's tower is hidden within a maze of\nthorns. Any story dealing with a sinister spellcaster dwelling\non the edge of civilization could be found here.\n\n[[Darkling|caligni]]s and [[yeth hound]]s are native to this barony.",
