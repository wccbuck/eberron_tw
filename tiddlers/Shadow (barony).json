The secret garden of the\nLady is walled and protected by dangerous plant creatures,\nbut holds imaginary flowers that an [[alchemist]] could use to do\namazing things. The Lady's tower is hidden within a maze of\nthorns. Any story dealing with a sinister spellcaster dwelling\non the edge of civilization could be found here.",
