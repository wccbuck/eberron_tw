title: Numat's trick tubes
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This drab pair of empty ceramic cylinders are magically linked. Each vessel is 3 inches in diameter and 1 foot tall. Placing an item inside one of the vessels and closing the lid will magically teleport it to the second tube, making a quiet whoosh sound when it does. A quiet thud can be heard when receiving an item. A tube can't send more than 2 pounds of material at a time, and can't be used to send a creature. Both vessels must be on the same [[plane]] of existence and have their lids closed in order for an item to be teleported between them.
