A spirit of the land is a powerful [[elemental]] force of nature tied to [[Lamannia]] that lies dormant until the area it guards is threatened. Each assumes dominion over a particular bounded geographical area, such as a small valley, a river, or a desert, existing as a living part of the land. [[Ahdryatmin]] is one such spirit, dwelling in a fertile valley in the heart of [[Adar]].

In its natural form, a spirit of the land is an invisible and
intangible force. It appears as a shapeless mist to creatures
that can see invisible things. When it wishes to manifest a
physical form, a spirit of the land can assume the shape of a
humanoid, animal, or elemental of its own size composed of
one particular elementâ€”air, earth, fire, or water.

Spirits of the land are always aware of what transpires in
their territories, and they punish all who would ravage or
defile them. They get along well with [[druid]]s as well as with
races that respect the land.
