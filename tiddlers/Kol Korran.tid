Kol Korran is the Sovereign of World and Wealth, the god of commerce. He guards travelers and guides traders. Merchants, miners, and any who desire to improve their lot in life trust that Kol Korran will help them achieve their dreams, while the wealthy often donate to good causes as a sacrifice to the Sovereign in the hopes that he will maintain their fortunes. His likeness appears on [[coins|money]] throughout the [[Five Nations]]. He guides fair negotiation and encourages the //flow// of wealth rather than the hoarding of it; in the [[Pyrinean Creed]], wealth should be a rising tide that lifts all ships. Those driven solely by greed prefer the [[Keeper]] of the [[Dark Six]]. 

He encourages his worshipers to:

* Engage in fair and honest trade that benefits all parties.
* Embrace travel as a path to broadening your horizons, cultivating new trading partners, and experiencing the richness the world has to offer.
* Recognize that true wealth is not measured in coins, but in generosity of spirit; share your prosperity to enrich your community.
* Remember that a charming smile and a kind word are often more powerful than a blade and a strong arm.

According to the [[Pyrinean Creed]], Kol Korran is the son of [[Olladra]] and [[Onatar]] (and twin brother of the [[Keeper]]), making him the only "second generation" Sovereign. The teachings of the [[Sovereign Host]] infer from this that wealth and trade must follow other pillars of civilization.

!! {{!!title}} in Other Traditions

Kol Korran is held in high honor by the [[Three Faces of Coin]] sect, alongside [[Onatar]] and the [[Keeper]].

The [[dwarves|dwarf]] of the [[Mror Holds]] honor Kol Korran and his father [[Onatar]] perhaps more than any other of the Host. [[Kol Korran's Throne]] in [[Krona Peak]] is the largest temple to the Sovereign on [[Khorvaire]].

Kol Korran and [[Arawai]] are held in high regard by the faith known as [[Sela's Path]], followed by many within House [[Lyrandar]]. Those who follow Selaâ€™s Path believe that Arawai and Kol Korran sent the [[house|dragonmarked house]]'s founders Lyran and Selavash their [[dragonmark]]s to bring unity and prosperity to the [[half-elf]] people.

[[Dragon|dragon]]s who follow the [[Thir]] faith and wish to embody the [[Sovereign archetype]] of Kol Korran (or the [[Keeper]]) are known as [[masters of the hoard|master of the hoard]].
