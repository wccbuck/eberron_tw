Kol Korran is the Sovereign of World and Wealth, the god of commerce. He guards travelers and guides traders. His likeness appears on coins throughout the [[Five Nations]]. He guides fair negotiation; those driven solely by greed prefer the [[Keeper]] of the [[Dark Six]]. 

He encourages his worshipers to:

* Acquire wealth through honest trade.
* Travel. New lands offer new trading partners to cultivate and new resources to gather.
* Remember that a charming smile and a kind word are often more powerful than a blade and a strong arm.

According to the [[Pyrinean Creed]], Kol Korran is the son of [[Olladra]] and [[Onatar]] (and twin brother of the [[Keeper]]), making him the only "second generation" Sovereign. The teachings of the [[Sovereign Host]] infer from this that wealth and trade must follow other pillars of civilization.

Kol Korran is held in high honor by the [[Three Faces of Coin]] sect, alongside [[Onatar]] and the [[Keeper]].

The [[dwarves|dwarf]] of the [[Mror Holds]] honor Kol Korran and his father [[Onatar]] perhaps more than any other of the Host. [[Kol Korran's Throne]] in [[Krona Peak]] is the largest temple to the Sovereign on [[Khorvaire]].

Kol Korran and [[Arawai]] are held in high regard by the faith known as [[Sela's Path]], followed by many within House [[Lyrandar]]. Those who follow Selaâ€™s Path believe that Arawai and Kol Korran sent the [[house|dragonmarked house]]'s founders Lyran and Selavash their [[dragonmark]]s to bring unity and prosperity to the [[half-elf]] people.

[[Dragon|dragon]]s who follow the [[Thir]] faith and wish to embody the [[Sovereign archetype]] of Kol Korran are known as [[masters of the hoard|master of the hoard]].
