The standing stones, and\nindeed the very earth they rest upon, came to Arcanix\nfrom an ancient [[Q'barra]]n ruin ages ago after the mages\ndiscovered that the stones could bridge the [[plane]]s. On\neach stone is a magic rune. When the stones are activated in a specific sequence, everything inside the ring\nis whisked to another plane. Concentrated research\nhas uncovered a few sequences so far, sometimes with\ndisastrous results, but the studies continue.",
