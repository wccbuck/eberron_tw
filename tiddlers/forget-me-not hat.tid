This hat, which has a pale blue flower pinned in its band, has three charges which recharge daily at dawn. While wearing the hat, you can spend a charge and tip the hat's brim in a friendly manner towards a person within 10 feet to cause that person to forget the last sentence they heard within the last minute. You must [[make an attempt|Taking Action]] to successfully overcome the creature's mental safeguards in order to do this; on anything less than a [[full success]], they realize a few minutes later that someone altered their memory. The target can recall any forgotten sentences with the help of a [[restoration]] spell.
