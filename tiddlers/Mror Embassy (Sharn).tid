The [[Mror Holds]] are a loose confederation of [[clan|Mror clan]]s,
each with its own mercantile interests. Each of the
holds has a representative at the Mror consulate,
who negotiates on behalf of their clan. These consuls
are devoted to their work, and compared to the
[[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Embassy (Sharn)]] ambassadors there is little conflict among
the [[dwarves|dwarf]]. The dwarf consuls rarely have any use
for adventurers, and it would be extremely unusual
for a party to be called to the consulate.

The most noteworthy consul is [[Lain|Lain Soldorak]] of Clan
[[Soldorak]], a socialite who often hosts lavish galas at his estate
in [[Highhold]].
