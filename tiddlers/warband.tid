Within a [[Tairnadal]] war clan, each [[elf]]'s closest companions are the other members of their warband, who they may serve alongside for many decades or even centuries. Warbands (composed of eight to twelve warriors) are trained to be self-sufficient, and given the nomadic nature of Tairnadal life, the other members of a warband are the only reliable social contact a Tairnadal has through much of their existence. Members of a warband are fighting an endless war, so they have to be able to work together and to trust one another. The band works together to settle any feuds and disagreements internally.

Though warbands can be made up of [[elves|elf]] with the same [[spiritual lineage|Spirits of the Past]], this practice is very rare. [[Patron ancestors|patron ancestor]] are essentially military specialties: [[Vadallia]] is a leader, [[Cardaen]] provides arcane support, and [[Taeri]] specializes in melee. You’ll rarely find a warband that has more than one Vadallia, because what’s the point of having two leaders? Most warbands have a versatile blend of patron ancestors that serve the needs of the unit. A warband with a highly specialized function—a band of archers or a commando unit specializing in urban infiltration—may have multiple elves that follow the same ancestor because that overlap of skills is desirable for that purpose.

The //shan//s (lords of clans) are very careful in who they assign to which warband, in part because some [[patron ancestor]]s have stories that are fundamentally at odds; you don’t want to put someone whose patron is known for chivalry and honor in the same warband with a patron known for ruthless cruelty. This contributes to the conflicting impressions of the [[Valenar]] within the [[Five Nations]]: some say they adhere to a strict code of honor, while others say they are brutal and cruel. Both stories are true; they’re just describing warbands driven by different patron ancestors.

Each band is led by a //lu-shan// (“band lord”). When there is a split-second military decision to be made, the lu-shan commands and their word can't be questioned. But when there are less pressing issues, the band debates them around the campfire and consensus generally rules; the lu-shan has the final say, but it’s rare for a lu-shan to veto the decisions of the band without clear military reason. And on the rare occasions they do veto, the band respects the decision not for the title alone, but because they respect the lu-shan as a person—and as a revenant of a particular ancestor.

!! Where's Your Warband?

The warband is the basic social unit of the [[Tairnadal]]. If you’re playing an adult Tairnadal [[elf]], your warband is your family. So why are you traveling around with a group of adventurers instead of serving with your warband? As an adventurer, you can use the table below to inspire reasons for why you’ve
left your warband behind.

| !<<dr d8>> |!Warband Fate |
| 1 |Your warband is in [[Aerenal]]. You left because of a vision from your [[patron ancestor]], and you plan to return once you’ve fulfilled this mission. |
| 2 |Your warband was sent on a suicide mission. You’re believed to have died on that mission, and you need to lay low until you can expose the powerful //shan// who sent your band to their deaths. |
| 3 |You believe you’re to blame for the death of your warband, and you can’t return until you’ve redeemed yourself. |
| 4 |Your warband was betrayed by one of your fellow soldiers. The traitor escaped, and you can’t return until you have tracked this villain down. |
| 5 |Your warband was targeted by a specific organization—the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]]? the [[Royal Eyes]] of [[Aundair]]?—and you’ve sworn that you won’t return until you’ve avenged them. Are you hunting the specific individuals involved in the ambush, or are you planning to destroy the entire organization? |
| 6 |Your warband is active in [[Valenar]]. After you disagreed with [[Shaeras Vadallia]]’s actions, you were dishonorably discharged and banished from Valenar. Did you conflict because he betrayed [[Cyre]], or was it something more personal? |
| 7 |Your warband is active in [[Valenar]], but you’ve been given a covert assignment by the [[var-shan|Shaeras Vadallia]]. [[Elves|elf]] play long games; it may be that you’re expected to take decades to accomplish this mission. Are you tasked with acquiring an artifact, killing a particular enemy, or subtly driving a powerful force to attack Valenar? |
| 8 |Your warband is active in [[Valenar]], but you’ve gone AWOL. Is your desertion driven by a personal disagreement? By your [[patron ancestor]]? Or did you stumble upon a conspiracy within the army itself, which you couldn’t reveal to your warband without placing them in danger? If so, you hope to one day return, but you’ll need powerful allies to help you defeat this hidden enemy. |
