Ice is one of the four branches of the [[Prince of Frost]]'s court within the [[feyspire]] of [[Taer Syraen]]. It is the branch of preservation, composed of [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s who can manipulate cold in all its forms. When battle is joined, the power of Ice can turn the tide, but members of this branch have little interest in aggression. The Ice [[fey]] are artisans and architects, crafting weapons and tools and maintaining the walls and fortifications of the
citadel. They are also archivists who preserve the stories of the past and ensure that traditions aren’t forgotten.

The Ice branch is led by ''Forget Me Not'', an [[eladrin]] sorceress who has held her post for thousands of years. She serves the [[Prince of Frost]] by freezing his mortal captives and keeping them in her Silent Gallery. But beyond these, every time the citadel has drifted into [[Eberron]], Forget Me Not has chosen a remarkable mortal of her own to preserve in ice. She does not do this out of malice; on the contrary, Forget Me Not believes she has done these mortals a great honor, preserving them from the ravages of time so that they are remembered—at least by those who visit her glacial garden.
