Even the mightiest hero can\nbe laid low by disease or ill fortune, as the Keeper has a vast\narsenal to bring down those that he desires. Once he pulls you\ndown into the darkness, he will snatch your soul before it can\nreach [[Dolurrh]] and add you to his endless hoard, where he can\ntoy with you and torment you until the end of time.\n\nThe Keeper (also known as Kol Turrant) is the patron of those who put personal gain\nabove all else. He guides those who use guile to gain gold,\nregardless of the cost to others. A rogue who invokes [[Olladra]]\nsees themselves as the hero of the story; one who calls on the\nKeeper has no compunctions about being the villain. Beyond\nguiding those who place profit before all else, the Keeper is also\nknown for his willingness to make dealsâ€”though his bargains\nare always slanted in his favor. Priests known as Talons make\nthese deals on behalf of the Keeper, though the terms are\noften abstract and driven purely by faith. An entertainer could\nbargain with a Talon, exchanging ten years of their life for\nfame; even if the entertainer subsequently becomes famous,\nthere's no way to know if this is the result of the bargain, nor to\nanticipate when the entertainer might suddenly die. This could\neasily be a part of the backstory of a player character. Did your\nentertainer make a bargain with the Keeper?\n\nAnother possible path for a player character or deadly NPC is that of being a bearer of a [[Keeper's Fang]]. These people receive visions of things that the Keeper wishes to add to his hoard; these are usually the souls of specific people, but they could also be\nartifacts or other unique treasures. \n\nThe Keeper's symbols include a [[dragonshard]] in the shape of a fang or a [[dracolich]]. Some believe the actions of the ancient [[dracolich]] [[Mazyralyx]] inspired many myths of the Keeper during the [[Age of Demons]].",
