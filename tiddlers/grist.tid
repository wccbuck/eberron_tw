title: grist
tooltip: mysterious ground meat, freely available in the cities of Droaam
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] provide the laborers of [[Droaam]]
with basic sustenance, which is served at dining halls
known as “grist mills.” This name is drawn from the
primary dish—a form of ground meat called //grist//,
prepared in stew, pie, or sausage form. Grist is
tough and has a sour taste, but it is filling and the mills have
a seemingly endless supply. Few laborers have any
idea where grist comes from, and of those who do,
few care; however, it might disturb visitors. Grist
is ground [[troll]] meat. On its own, troll meat is highly toxic and carcinogenic, but the Daughters have devised
a magical mixture of herbs and spices that's blended with the ground meat in a special ritual and makes it edible.

The form of grist served in a mill changes daily—stew,
sausage, meat broth—but the substance remains the same, and
most easterners find it unpleasant. The one saving grace of grist is that it's free. So, enjoy a bowl of grist stew—there's plenty more where it came from!

!! Grist Mills

Each grist mill includes a stable of imprisoned [[troll]]s. Some have been bred for this purpose; others are being punished for incompetence or for challenging the [[Daughters|Daughters of Sora Kell]]; and some have chosen to make this sacrifice for their nation. Many grist mills double as garrisons of [[Maenya's Fist]], and most of the trolls who are harvested there are [[Sora Maenya]]'s war troll soldiers who are trained to overcome any form of pain or hardship and to have absolute faith in their regenerative abilities. Flesh is stripped away, slowly enough to ensure that the troll can regenerate from the loss without serious harm (though the pain is agonizing). Harvesting and processing facilities are typically staffed by [[goblin]]s, [[kobold]]s, and a few [[magewright]]s of the [[Venomous Demesne]]. [[Harpy|harpy]] songbirds are often employed to help soothe the trolls, and a regular stream of [[gargoyle]] messengers passes in and out of the mill.
