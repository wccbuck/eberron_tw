A blink dog is a [[fey]] canine creature which takes its name from its ability to "blink" in and out of existence, a talent it uses to aid its attacks and to avoid harm. Blink dogs harbor a long-standing hatred for [[displacer beast]]s and attack them on sight.

The blink dog is the heraldic emblem of House [[Ghallanda]].
