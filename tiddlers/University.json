        "text": "The pursuit of knowledge and education are things that\nflourish in times of peace. While most [[dominion]]s are\ndevoted to their own personal contemplation, the [[Throne|throne]] of\nKnowledge maintains the University of [[Syrania]], where chosen\nstudents can study an astonishing array of subjects with\n[[virtue]]s of knowledge and the occasional guest dominion. The\ncatch is that students need to be admitted... and there isn't\nactually a process for applying. At the moment, the University\nonly has twenty students, chosen from across the [[plane]]s by\nroaming virtues.\n\nFor planar travelers who come to Syrania, the University is\na good repository of general knowledge; if the scholarly virtues\ncan't help, they'll likely know the way to a dominion that can.\nIt's also an unusual background for a player character; perhaps\na [[sorcerer]] unlocked their powers at the University,\nor perhaps a [[warlock]]'s [[celestial]] patron is their thesis advisor.\n",
