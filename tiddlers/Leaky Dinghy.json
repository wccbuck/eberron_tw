        "text": "The Leaky Dinghy is a rotting, rat-infested, creaking mess of a tavern in the area of the [[Stormreach]] [[Harbor]] docks called Fisher’s Folly, an unsafe mishmash of rigging, fishing boats,\nand huts that is home to many of the city’s fishers.\n\nA hangout for sailors, fishers, and thrill seekers, the Dinghy persists only because of the love its\npatrons have for the place, keeping it alive despite the\nbest efforts of storm and rot to destroy it. The tavern’s\nsurvival against storms has become an occasion for\ncelebrations, with parties being held in the swaying\nstructure during the severest storms.\n\n[[Sahuagin|sahuagin]] come to the Dinghy looking to be\nhired as guides for ships crossing the [[Thunder Sea]],\nand the tavern offers dishes specifically for these sea\ndevils. Adventurous members of other races, and the\nextremely drunk, sometimes give this food a try, but\nthe raw and wriggling nature of the meals leads to very\ndistressed stomachs. \n\nThe shack of [[Capshaw the Crier]] sits nearby the Leaky Dinghy. [[Tattered Alice]] also lingers around Fisher's Folly.",
