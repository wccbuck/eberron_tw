''District Type:'' Finance district<br/>
''Buildings:'' Banks (10), moneychangers (60), temples
([[Kol Korran]]) (2), upscale food (80), exotic trades (40),
upscale trades (200), upscale residences (160)<br/>
''First Impression:'' There doesn't seem to be anyone
here who is not wealthy, and the whole district
seems to be set up as a shrine to money itself. Every
shop sells only the fi nest goods, each huge house is
impeccably maintained, and the sound of money
changing hands fills the air. Even the guards—who
are everywhere—seem well off.<br/>
''Social Class:'' Upper class<br/>
''Neighbors:'' [[Platinum Heights]] (north); [[Mithral Tower]] (southwest); [[Skysedge Park]] (southeast); [[Oak Towers]] (bridge, north); [[Crystal Bridge]] (bridge, northeast); [[Ambassador Towers]] (below, west); [[Sovereign Towers]] (below, east)

Korranath, [[Sharn]]'s sprawling financial district, is
also the seat of the [[Aurum]]'s power in the city. Named
for the great temple of [[Kol Korran]] that lies at its heart,
Korranath is utterly dedicated to the darker side of the
god of wealth—the pursuit of wealth at any cost.

Korranath includes the neighborhood of Korran-Thiven. Its name means “Korran's Blade”
in [[Dwarven|Mjordai]], and institutions there seem more obsessed with protecting wealth than with acquiring it.
