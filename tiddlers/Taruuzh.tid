Taruuzh was one of the greatest [[Dhakaan]]i [[daashor|artificer]]s who lived during the [[daelkyr]] incursion. His stronghold, Taruuzh Kraat, was located where [[Tzaryan Keep]] now stands in [[Droaam]]. According to legend, Taruuzh was the creator of the [[grieving tree]], as well as the mysterious "binding stones" which defeated an army of [[aberration]]s during the [[daelkyr]] war. He also crafted the Rod of Kings, [[Guulen]].
