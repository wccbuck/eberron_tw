title: Dew-on-the-Leaf
tooltip: awakened maple tree, guardian of Sylbaran
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This maple tree was [[awaken]]ed by [[Faena Graymorn]]—one of the most powerful [[druid]]s of the [[Wardens of the Wood]]—during the [[Eldeen|Eldeen Reaches]] uprising, and charged to watch over [[Sylbaran]]. Dew-on-the-Leaf generally takes root in the [[Haven|Haven (Sylbaran campsite)]] meadow, where they are always happy to discuss the philosophy of the Wardens of the Wood with initiates and curious travelers. While Dew-on-the-Leaf doesn’t have the power of the Great Druid [[Oalian]], they have performed spells associated with plants and earth—[[plant growth]], [[entangle]], [[thorn whip]], and others—and their full capabilities are unknown.
