She never ventures far from the court or\nfrom Kaiusâ€™s side, except when he sends her out in his name to\nhandle crises near and far. Moranna, a large, strong woman,\nhas a commanding manner and a no-nonsense approach\nthat leaves most of her underlings shaking in her wake.\n\nDuring the [[Last War]], Lady Moranna, serving as steward of [[Karrnath]], gave the order to reinstate the [[Sovereign Host]] as the state religion of the nation in place of the [[Blood of Vol]], and to disband the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]], the [[Onyx Skull]], and all other chivalric orders of Seekers.",
