Near the [[Keep of the Silver Flame]], Vestrii’s Arms caters
to the customer who wants a weapon but doesn’t want to
show it. The shop makes a variety of concealable weapons, particularly ones that a performer might want: juggling balls or clubs that sprout blades, iron-bound flutes, sword canes, and the like.
