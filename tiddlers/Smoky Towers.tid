Smoky Towers is in some ways an extension of the [[Torchfire]] district directly below it, perhaps slightly better off in general but not much different in essentials.
Smoky Towers is the entertainment district of [[Middle Menthis]], known for dinner theaters, recital halls, and one grand theater. It presents a grade of entertainment
that falls between the burlesque of [[Torchfire]] and the
classical drama of the [[University District]]â€”affordable
yet respectable, accessible yet thoughtful.

A small but significant number of people who
trace their origin to [[Cyre]] have made their home in
Smoky Towers. Although culturally they differ little
from their [[Brelish|Breland]] neighbors, this community has
become very active in the wake of Cyre's destruction, discussing rebuilding or reestablishing the nation elsewhere in [[Khorvaire]]. The [[Citadel|King's Citadel]] keeps
the Cyran community here under close watch due
to this potentially treasonous talk.
