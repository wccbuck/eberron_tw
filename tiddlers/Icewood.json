Those familiar with the wood know to keep away from the Madstone—it’s said that those who touch\nit lose their souls. Elders tell any who are willing to\nlisten that more than a few people have been lost in\nthat area of the woods over the years. Some of the\nold folk claim that, during their time and the time of\ntheir ancestors, the dead-white crystal has steadily\ngrown larger. They urge everyone to ignore the alluring whispers that draw the young and ambitious to the Icewood.",
