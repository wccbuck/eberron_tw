Elders tell any who are willing to\nlisten that more than a few people have been lost in\nthat area of the woods over the years. Some of the\nold folk claim that, during their time and the time of\ntheir ancestors, the dead-white crystal has steadily\ngrown larger. They urge everyone to ignore the alluring whispers that draw the young and ambitious to the Icewood.", "modified": "20210727192014372", "tags": "Karrnath forest Khorvaire", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "article": "the ", "category": "location", "color": "#3B5C0A", "polygons": "54.314,15.06 54.222,15.08 54.138,15.24 54.065,15.14 53.972,15.12 53.862,15.01 53.769,15.01 53.658,15.2 53.566,15.41 53.455,15.54 53.298,15.54 53.178,15.57 53.077,15.84 53.049,16.15 53.123,16.38 53.252,16.51 53.178,16.69 53.123,16.97 53.142,17.12 53.012,17.36 52.985,17.54 53.058,17.79 53.28,18.05 53.465,18.27 53.585,18.32 53.815,18.48 53.871,18.63 53.889,18.85 53.889,19.13 53.945,19.34 54.065,19.52 54.175,19.57 54.342,19.71 54.526,19.72 54.692,19.61 54.775,19.44 54.812,19.19 54.803,18.85 54.923,18.93 55.034,19.01 55.163,18.86 55.265,18.81 55.412,18.95 55.514,18.95 55.606,18.82 55.745,18.8 55.818,18.73 55.902,18.49 56.003,18.38 56.095,18.42 56.252,18.42 56.335,18.3 56.363,18.16 56.409,18.0 56.455,17.84 56.418,17.68 56.418,17.49 56.372,17.31 56.317,17.16 56.345,17.02 56.271,16.9 56.206,16.81 56.16,16.59 56.142,16.44 56.068,16.37 56.012,16.26 55.957,16.15 55.874,16.12 55.763,16.03 55.634,16.06 55.486,16.05 55.366,16.03 55.246,16.02 55.108,15.83 55.025,15.86 54.942,15.82 54.914,15.68 54.877,15.53 54.822,15.41 54.748,15.29 54.665,15.25 54.591,15.31 54.526,15.32 54.415,15.26 54.36,15.17", "style": "{\"color\":\"#333C1A\",\"fillColor\":\"#66883F\",\"fillOpacity\":\"0.8\"}"}
