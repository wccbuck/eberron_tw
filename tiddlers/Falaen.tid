tooltip: "the Silence", patron ancestor of the Tairnadal, deadly assassin
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Falaen is a [[patron ancestor]] of the [[Tairnadal]]. She was the deadliest assassin of the [[Age of Giants]], known as "the Silence" both for her skills at stilling
tongues and for her taciturn persona. Much about her
is a mystery, as suits a figure who lived in the shadows.
Falaen grew up among the [[drow]] and was trained to
kill her own kind; most stories say the drow took her
after they killed her family, but some maintain she
was at least part drow herself. What's certain is that
she turned against the drow and their [[giant]] masters,
and that during the Silenceâ€™s war in the shadows, she
brought down countless drow and struck deep inside
enemy lines.

!! Falaen's Chosen

By all accounts, Falaen was ruthless but
never cruel; she viewed her work as necessary but took
no joy in killing, and her [[revenants|Spirits of the Past]] usually share that
perspective. She was endlessly patient, and similarly,
her revenants sometimes wait weeks or months until
seizing the perfect moment to bring down their prey.
Unlike many [[Tairnadal]], Falaen revenants usually avoid
horses, as she had no love for the creatures.

Falaen revenants tend to be [[rogue]]s, [[gloom stalker]]s, and the like, but some follow other paths. While a [[Tairnadal]] [[warband]] might have a single Falaen revenant who serves as a scout, there are also several "Silent Bands" comprised entirely of her revenants, specializing in long-term covert operations.

!! Artifacts

Falaen specialized in two light blades, and either her weapons, her mask, or her legendary shadowy cloak would be prized artifacts for a revenant to recover.
