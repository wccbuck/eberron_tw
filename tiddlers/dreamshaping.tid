title: dreamshaping

One of the primary purposes
of the [[hanbalani|hanbalani alta]] in [[Riedra]] is to shape the dreams of the [[populace|Riedrans]],
projecting soothing dreams across the nation. This is
a delicate art; unlike [[charm]] or [[dominate]], a dream does not
force the target to take any action. It simply plants an
idea; if the subject acts, they do so of their own free will.

In limited circumstances, nocturnal manipulation
involves targeted dreams, visions crafted for a particular
subject. By this means, the [[quori]] sparked the [[Sundering]]
and continue to undermine their enemies.

A far more insidious dream conditioning occurs
over a wide area. Effectively, the network of monoliths
projects a constant, low-level dream effect across [[Riedra]].
Those who fall asleep and fail to resist the effect have the dream that is currently being
projected. The typical Riedran dream is soothing and
vague, blending images to project the wonder of Riedra,
the joys of being part of a greater whole, and the celestial benevolence of the [[Inspired]]. Every so often, these soothing visions are interspersed with flashes of the dark horrors that lurk outside the borders of Riedra. Although
insufficient to change the views of a PC over a short time,
the dreams serve to constantly reinforce a Riedran's
indoctrination. Although the dream can be resisted, Riedrans voluntarily accept it. A Riedran takes comfort in her stable dreams and looks forward to resting and bathing
in the love of the Inspired. The widespread knowledge
that Riedrans suffer from chaotic, unpredictable dreams
when in foreign lands is one more reason they hate to
leave their homeland.

[[Monolith|hanbalani alta]] dreamshaping is a background effect,
and targeted use of dream magic takes precedence over the broadcasts. Furthermore,
the [[dreamtouched]] are immune to dreamshaping.

The content of dreams is controlled from [[Dal Quor]], and it can be made more specific (for example,
broadcasting the image of a wanted criminal). A particular dream can be targeted at a village, a sphere, or
the entire nation. The [[quori]] can also choose to use the
dreamshapers to project nightmares across a region.
In this case, the dreamer is fatigued, and the disturbed sleep is not restorative. These
nightmare attacks are usually blamed on [[kalashtar]],
[[dromite]]s, or //altavars//.
