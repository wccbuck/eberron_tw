type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Explorers tend to need healing more than merchants and crafters, and [[Kurala d'Jorasco]] does a brisk business in [[Clifftop]]. Here, visitors can have their wounds mended, their [[disease]]s cured, and even their curses lifted. Kurala's House includes three lesser healers, and Kurala's husband Janasar, who specializes in the care and treatment of animals.
