Licensed by the [[Warning Guild]] of House [[Medani]], truthtellers are [[magewright]]s who can cast [[zone of truth]] as an hour-long ritual. The ritual casting includes a lengthy invocation and chalk symbols traced across the area of effect. The truthteller knows if someone successfully resists the effects of the spell, and encourages them to voluntarily submit to the ritual; resisting the spell is usually seen as an attempt to evade questioning.
