An essence disk is a dark metal disk engraved with arcane sigils. When embedded in the chest of a [[warforged]], it enhances some of the wielder's abilities. For example, an //essence of the scout// improves a warforged's ability to hide and move silently. An //essence of the guard// enhances a warforged's watchfulness.
