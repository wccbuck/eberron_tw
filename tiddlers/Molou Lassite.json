He was also a master brewer,\nand the Lassites were beloved by the buccaneers and\nscoundrels of the region. Molou Lassite contributed little military force to the [[Storm Lords]], but he gained the invaluable good will of the common people, and many say that he bought the peace with [[kuryeva]].\n\n[[Molou's Distillery]] in the [[Marketplace]] bears his name.",
