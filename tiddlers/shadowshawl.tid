This light gray shawl is made of thick fabric that resembles woven spider webs. While wearing this shawl with its hood up, your face is hidden within a small pocket of magical darkness. You can see through this darkness from beneath the hood as if it were nonmagical. If you are sensitive to [[sunlight|Sun]], you are unaffected by that trait while the hood is up.
