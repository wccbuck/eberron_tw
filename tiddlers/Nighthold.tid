The palace complex of Nighthold in [[Atur]] is a secondary seat for the royal family of [[Karrnath]]. As Atur is a Grand Duchy, it is semi-autonomous, but the presence of the Nighthold has always been a source of pride and a sign of the importance of the city. King [[Kaius III|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] rarely visits Nighthold, but Queen [[Etrigani]] frequently stays here.
