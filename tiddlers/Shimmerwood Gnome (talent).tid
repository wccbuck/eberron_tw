As a [[gnome]] of [[Zilargo]], you gain the following benefits:

* You can cast [[lesser illusion]] or [[ghost sound]].
* Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with small [[beast]]s. Gnomes with this power often keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, woodpeckers, and other creatures as beloved pets.
