Thalanna is a [[cleric]] and Mentor of the [[Shadow]] who serves the [[Shrine of the Shadow]] in [[Everbright]], [[Sharn]]. She is known as a reliable source of information about the underworld of the city, always willing to share her knowledge… for a price. But she may also approach the adventurers and simply tell them things. Did they know that [[Ilsa Boromar]] is going to assassinate [[Saidan Boromar]] tonight? Did they know that their recently murdered friend was killed by [[Thora Tavin]]? Thalanna has nothing personal to gain by sharing this information, but she enjoys setting wheels in motion. And Thalanna can offer to teach a [[wizard]] character a few things they won’t learn in [[Arcanix]]—these secrets are powerful, but is the character willing to pay the price?
