Those seeking to buy or sell \"unique\" items may find themselves at the Hawk and Moon, a junk shop whose dusty wares hint that its most profitable deals are done under the counter. The Hawk's proprietor [[Dhasuun]] is the [[Dream Merchants]]' agent in [[Ardhmen]] and can be a vital resource for PCs seeking information on [[Riedra]]â€”especially those hoping to cross the often dangerous [[Syrkarn]]-[[Riedra]] frontier. Dhasuun's forgery skills are exceptional, and he is one of the few sources of counterfeit Riedran traveling papers in all of [[Syrkarn]].",
