Grimstone Keep is a fortress in [[Droaam]] that marks the seat of the [[gargoyle]] [[warlord]] [[Cairngorm]]'s fiefdom. It is the largest single origin of gargoyles in [[Khorvaire]], aside from possibly the [[Stonelands|Cazhaak Draal]]. Along with gargoyles, the keep is mostly populated by [[goblin]]s and Gaa'aram [[orc]]s.

!! History of Grimstone

Grimstone Keep is built within the ruins of an ancient [[Dhakaan]]i fortress. In the decades leading up to the first open conflict with [[daelkyr]] forces during the [[Xoriat]] incursion, Dhakaani stoneworkers in the fortified settlements south of the [[Byeshk Mountains]] became enamored with creating “guardian statues”—grotesque stone sentries depicting [[goblin]] champions, but typically adorned with [[fiend]]ish features such as horns and bat-like wings. They hand-carved these effigies in mass quantities, and nowhere was this more true than in old Grimstone; guardian statues could be found perched on every wall and building, and crouched along the corridors of the central keep. In addition, wingless statues depicting [[hobgoblin]] and [[bugbear]] heroes were erected in courtyards and boulevards.

When the [[daelkyr]] [[Orlassk]] first clashed with the [[Dhakaan]]i [[goblinoid]]s, it breathed life into each of these stone sentries. They came into awareness with an instinctual revulsion for organic life, and upon their first conscious moments, the statues found themselves surrounded by their goblinoid creators—repulsive, decaying creatures of flesh filled with disgusting fluids. Orlassk never controlled these first [[gargoyle]]s directly, but it didn’t have to; the statues immediately lashed out against the goblinoids and claimed the fortresses and settlements of the [[Byeshk|Byeshk Mountains]] foothills as their own.

But the [[gargoyle]]s soon realized that they were vastly outnumbered by the creatures of the flesh. And in time, as they came to understand their own strange bodies, they realized they didn’t need food, supplies, or anything else from the world beyond their walls. So they remained at their posts, and eventually fell into a deep torpor. In this state, their spark of life was so weak that they couldn’t even be sensed by [[detect immortal]] or similar spells. 

The Empire of [[Dhakaan]] slowly crumbled, and over the centuries, the denizens of the [[Barrens|Droaam]] shunned the ruins of the Byeshk foothills, unnerved by the fearsome //kurarguls//—”deadly stones.” The ruins remained empty and almost perfectly preserved until 870 YK, when the Church of the [[Silver Flame]] established Brightstone Keep under the command of one Friar Alasant. The [[templar]]s were intrigued by the guardian statues, but they weren’t frightened by them, and their [[divination]]s indicated the sentries were no more than carved stone. But even in their hibernation, the [[gargoyle]]s remained aware of their surroundings.

The [[Silver Flame]] friars and [[templar]]s held Brightstone Keep for over a century... then [[Sora Katra]] came, alone. The wind carried her whispers through the stone. Each [[gargoyle]] heard something different—the perfect story to pull them from their slumber. Some heard tales of the wonders waiting to be seen out in the world. For others, Sora Katra painted pictures of the thrill to be found in battle, or the satisfaction to be found in protecting a loved one. Her magic roused the [[gargoyle]]s throughout the keep, and they turned on the [[templar]]s. However, not all of the stone host joined the [[hag]]; the gargoyles of Brightstone had heard the songs and teachings of the [[Silver Flame]] as they slept, and some of them were spiritually transformed by the vision of the Flame. These gargoyles helped a group of friars escape and return to [[Flamekeep]], where they have embraced the Silver Flame and fight alongside [[templar]]s to this day; these gargoyles are known as //wingwyrds//.

Soon, the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] emerged and announced the nation of [[Droaam]] to the world. They chose the newly-christened Grimstone Keep (or //Jurgul Zaal// in [[Goblin]]) as the seat of a new province, and appointed the [[nabassu]] [[Cairngorm]] to serve as its [[warlord]] and guardian. Many [[gargoyle]]s of the [[Stonelands|Cazhaak Draal]], who had been awake for over a century, soon flocked to Grimstone and their new prince.

Over the last decade, many [[gargoyle]]s of Grimstone have made their way east, and can be found as couriers and scouts across the [[Five Nations]], especially in [[Sharn]].
