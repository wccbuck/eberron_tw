Travelers from all over [[Khorvaire]] mingle here, and many rumors get their start from the boasting of Hideaway patrons.\n\nThe Hideaway is truer to its name than many would imagine. It is owned by [[Gulo Boromar]], a wealthy consigliere of the [[Boromar Clan]]. Despite the popularity of the lounge, it actually loses money each month due to high upkeep and expensive imported drinks. However, Gulo uses the Hideaway to launder money and shield the financial activities of the Boromars, which makes it worth the investment.",
