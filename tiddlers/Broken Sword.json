Located in [[Bloodstone]], this tavern counts\nwar criminals, brigands, and revolutionaries among its\nclients. A [[Cyran|Cyre]] [[warforged]] named Maul serves as both\nbartender and bouncer; either he owns the tavern,\nor the true owner has chosen to remain anonymous.\nPatrons of the Broken Sword are expected to leave\ntheir national feuds outside. Within the Broken Sword,\nthe [[Thrane]] [[paladin]] and [[Karrnath]]i [[bone knight]] are\nboth exiles. The unwritten rule is that if anyone starts\na fight in the Sword—especially a [[Sentinel Marshal|Sentinel Marshals]] or\nother bounty hunter—every patron lends a hand, acting\nto end the fight as quickly as possible.",
