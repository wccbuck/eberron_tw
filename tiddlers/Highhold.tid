When House [[Kundarak]] first established itself in
[[Sharn]], the [[dwarf]] immigrants who came with the
house sought to make their mark on the city. While
dwarf engineers had played a significant role in
the construction of [[Sharn]], the city was designed
for [[human]]s. Highhold is the first district to be built
by dwarves for dwarves, and their touch is evident
throughout the district. While the dwarves appreciate luxury and comfort, they are also concerned with
defense and durability, and the buildings of Highhold are among of the strongest and most defensible
in the city.

Dwarves make up the majority of the population in Highholdâ€”both recent immigrants from the
[[Mror Holds]] and those whose families have lived
in [[Sharn]] for generations. The inns and taverns
serve strong Mror ale and stonebreaker mead, and
most of the buildings and furnishings are built to
dwarven proportions. Beyond the dwarves, there are
a considerable number of [[gnome]]s in the district, reflecting the strong economic ties between House [[Sivis]] and House [[Kundarak]].

Businesses in Highhold include a branch of the
Kundarak Bank and a Sivis [[message station|speaking stone]]. There
are also restaurants serving Mror food (an acquired
taste for most humans) and a variety of other crafters,
including master masons, architects, and armorers.
Many of the inhabitants work for one of the branches
of the Kundarak Bank, while others work in the
[[Cog|Cogs]] foundries but have positions allowing them to
afford to live above the surface.
