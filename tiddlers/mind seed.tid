[[Kalaraq|kalaraq]] [[quori]] have the ability to devour the thoughts
of a victim, slowly replacing that being's personality and rendering the victim a willing servant of the
kalaraq. The process is a mental disease that attacks
the victim's will instead of the body. It is used sparingly by the kalaraq, since there have been incidents
where the victim of a mind seed has gone rogue.
Nonetheless, it's an effective means of placing a mole
in an enemy organization.

!! The Limits of Mind Seed

The mind seed power is perhaps the most powerful weapon
in the [[quori]] arsenal. So why don't the quori control the
world? Why don't they mind seed everyone in [[Khorvaire]]?

To begin with, mind seed is no common tool. Only a master telepath can manifest the power, and it requires a significant expenditure of energy. Only a
select handful of the [[Inspired]] can manifest the power,
and they can't use it on a regular basis. The [[kalaraq]] are few in number and have many important duties in [[Sarlona]] and [[Dal Quor]].

Furthermore, mind seed is an uncertain tool. The
user has no control over the newborn seed. The [[quori]] are
fanatically dedicated to [[il-Lashtavar]], and usually this is
sufficient to ensure the loyalty of seedsâ€”the victim's personality mirrors that of the quori, and usually they serve [[Dal Quor]] with unswerving devotion. Nonetheless, a seed
occasionally turns against the [[Inspired]] and the [[Dreaming Dark]]. These rogue seeds possess all the knowledge (if only a fraction of the power) of a potent quori. They can
be the most dangerous dissidents of all.

If a party dedicates itself to battling the [[Dreaming Dark]], it is possible that a PC will be targeted with mind seed. Mental [[abjuration]]s can prevent a seed from germinating,
but only [[psychic chirurgery]], [[reality revision]], [[wish]], or miraculous [[divine magic]] can remove a seed. Few people in Eberron possess such power. The Venerable [[Thatari]] of [[Tashalatora]] is one; the [[Keeper of the Flame]] is another.
