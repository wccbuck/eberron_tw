type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Coralonyn is an ancient [[gold dragon]]. He rode at [[Galifar|Galifar Wynarn]]’s
side in human form, as a spy for the [[Chamber]]. Through
his studies of the [[Draconic Prophecy]], he possesses knowledge of
the past and of the possible paths of the future. He has
fought [[rakshasa]]s in the [[Demon Wastes]], and gazed on
[[Tiamat]]’s prison in the [[Pit of Five Sorrows]]. He spent a
decade as a [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] prince and a century studying ruins
in [[Xen'drik]]. Coralonyn is immensely powerful physically, but he is far more. He has knowledge it would take a [[human]] fourteen lifetimes to gain. He has contacts across the world, and has negotiated with [[angel]]s and argued with kings. With force of will and the sorcerous power of his blood, he can make his very wishes reality.
