Scampers or "scamps" are small feathered bipedal [[dinosaur]]s native to the [[Talenta Plains]]. They are about the size of a chicken, with nimble foreclaws. They are often used as assistant animals by the [[halfling]] tribes fetching small things and performing simple tasks. Scamp races are a popular basis for gambling.
