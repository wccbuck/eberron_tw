        "text": "While small, the Gilded Labyrinth is the one truly respected [[arcane order]] in [[Thrane]]. Its members are more commonly known as Silver Pyromancers, and specialize in incorporating the [[divine|divine magic]] energy of the [[Silver Flame]] into [[arcane|arcane magic]] spells, blending its radiant energy with elemental fire. This requires a deep devotion to the Flame in addition to arcane knowledge. The Labyrinth is an arm of the Church of the [[Silver Flame]], and the \"Beacon\" [[wandslinger]]s of [[Thrane]] each train under one or more Labyrinth [[wizard]]s.\n\nThe name of the order is a metaphor for spiritual advancement: arcane knowledge is the Gilded Labyrinth, and we master it by finding a path through it. \n\n!! Arcane Theory\n\nThe magic that Silver Pyromancers channel falls between [[Dominion Theory]] and [[Externalist Theory]]. They draw their arcane power from the concrete source of the [[Silver Flame]], but this isnâ€™t an easy thing to do. The Flame responds more easily to the draw of faith than to scientific manipulation, and Silver Pyromancers generally need both; they manipulate the Flame using scientific principles, but it is still their faith that allows them to grasp the power to begin with.",
