While he shares his [[older sister|Aurala ir'Wynarn]]'s vision for a united [[Galifar]] under Aundair, he believes himself to be more suited to the task. Despite his respect for Lord [[Darro ir'Lain]], he rejects Darro's plans to retake the [[Eldeen Reaches]] by force, seeing it as a waste of time and resources.\n\nDuring the negotiations of the [[Treaty of Thronehold]], Adal refused to allow [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]] to concede the pieces of Western [[Thrane]] that Aundair had seized during the war in exchange for the return of [[Thaliost]]. In particular, he saw great value in [[Arcanix]]—once a small village with an unusually prodigious school of [[arcane magic]], now the ground base of the [[Arcane Congress]]' floating islands. Many in [[Fairhaven]]'s court, including Aurala to some degree, believe Adal's refusal to trade Arcanix the village for Thaliost to have been a mistake. As such, Adal seeks to prove them wrong—his plans and research all focus on how to retake Thaliost, even if it means provoking war with [[Thrane]].\n\nThe [[Ninth Wands]] of [[Stormreach]] secretly report to the Minister.",
