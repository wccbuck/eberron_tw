A forgehold is a large facility designed to research and produce magical goods or services. Most of the forgeholds in [[Khorvaire]] are owned and operated by House [[Cannith]]; many of these are considered [[enclave]]s of the house.

Inside [[Cyre]], [[Whitehearth]] might be one of the oldest and most well known of [[Cannith]] forgeholds, but it is not unique. Several more Cannith facilities, including ''Tallis'', ''Blacklion'', ''Cabblen Hall'', and ''Kronu Hall'', still exist in and under the [[Mournland]]. Their purposes might be different from Whitehearthâ€™s, but their treasures still await liberation.
