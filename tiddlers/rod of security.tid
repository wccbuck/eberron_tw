While holding this rod, you can choose to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that
exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that
the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely
glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island,
fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine.
Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough
water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else
that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space
can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from
a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside
the extraplanar space.

Visitors in the paradise recover from injuries twice as fast as normal. Also, creatures
don't age while in the paradise, although time passes
normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to
200 days divided by the number of creatures present
(round down).

When the time runs out or you choose to end it,
all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when
you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest
that location. The rod can't be used again until ten days
have passed.
