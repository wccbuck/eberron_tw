This simple silver locket is worn around a chain. It allows the wearer to protect one memory within the locket. The wearer will not forget the memory so long as it is so protected and the locket is worn. Additionally, that memory cannot be accessed, modified, or destroyed by [[detect thoughts]], [[modify memory]], or other memory-affecting magic or effects.
