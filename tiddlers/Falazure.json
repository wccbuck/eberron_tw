Just as exhaustion is followed by sleep, followed by waking renewed, adherents of Falazure revere death as a joyous releasing of the burdens of the flesh. Many take the analogy further, and consider [[undeath|undead]] to be akin to awaking from a refreshing sleep. \"When sleep comes, let me wake from the sleep. When death comes, let me wake in undeath.\"",
