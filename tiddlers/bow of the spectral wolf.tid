type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This heavy oak bow has a fur-wrapped grip. The wielder can [[push themselves|push yourself]] and shoot an arrow that takes on the shape of a darting, spectral wolf. The wolf mauls the target for fifteen seconds before dispersing into a cloud of sparks. This bow regains one charge at dawn and one charge at dusk.
