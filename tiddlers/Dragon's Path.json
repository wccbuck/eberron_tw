        "text": "The families of House [[Thuranni]] are driven by a sense of destiny, and the secrets they uncover are fragments of a puzzle of fate that has yet to be assembled. This drive is epitomized by the Dragon's Path, an organization dedicated to discovering the secrets of the [[Draconic Prophecy]].\n\nComposed primarily of older house members with a strong sense of history and a working knowledge of magic, the Dragon’s Path includes architects, astrologers, historians, and the field agents who do their bidding. The traditions of the Dragon’s Path are unique, and do not overlap with the work of the [[Chamber]] or House [[Sivis]]’s study of the [[Prophecy|Draconic Prophecy]]. Members of the order believe that the [[dragon]]s have kept their knowledge of the Prophecy to themselves for far too long, and recall the [[dragon wars|Elf-Dragon Wars]] of [[Aerenal]] as proof that the great wyrms’ agenda sees the “lesser races” as expendable if need be. \n\nThe order is administered and convened by Viceroy [[Ureilya d'Thuranni]].",
