Adventurers' guilds are organizations that provide adventurers with opportunities for work and camaraderie. The most prominent guilds in the [[Five Nations]] are the [[Clifftop Adventurers' Guild]] and the [[Deathsgate Guild]] (both based in [[Sharn]]), as well as the prestigious [[Wayfinder Foundation]] (based in [[Fairhaven]]).

But what exactly is an "adventurer"? In the world of [[Eberron]], an adventurer is a kind of soldier of fortune with a wide variety of skills who performs dangerous odd jobsâ€”sometimes for pay by a patron, other times for the lure of treasure or other goals. The term can be considered a catchall for any of the following professions:

* ''Monster Hunter:'' The most common form of adventurer is the person who is hired to dispatch rampaging horrors or other monstrous nuisances. 
* ''Explorer:'' Large swaths of [[Khorvaire]] remain mostly uncharted, not to mention the jungle continent of [[Xen'drik]], the frigid [[Frostfell]], and the depths of [[Khyber]]. Expeditions need rugged folk to assist in shining the light of discovery into these unexplored regions.
* ''Dungeon Delver:'' Archaeologists seeking to explore the ancient ruins scattered across the continent often hire adventurers as protection against whatever dangers lurk there, in exchange for pay or for a portion of whatever treasure lies within. Some adventurers also simply engage in treasure hunting in abandoned ruins on their own initiative.
* ''Mournland Salvager:'' The salvagers who embark on missions into the [[Mournland]] to retrieve items of value from the ruins of [[Cyre]] can be considered adventurers. 

...and many others. Unlike a traditional mercenary, who is hired to fight [[humanoid]] opponents in warfare, an adventurer is hired for more unusual tasks that require facing the unknown and adapting to exotic situations. 

!!! Membership Benefits

Those who are accepted into an adventurers' guild such as the [[Clifftop Adventurers' Guild]] or the [[Deathsgate Guild]] must pay yearly dues (usually ~[[3c|money]]). The primary benefit of belonging to a guild is access to work, since the guildmaster can connect parties of adventurers with patrons and jobs suited to their talents. Beyond that, there are a few additional benefits: 

* You can store items at the guildhall free of charge.
* You can book lodging at the guildhall for a reasonable fee (usually ~3c per two weeks). The accommodations are modest, but the guild provides stronger security for lodgers and their possessions than you'd find at an inn.
* An adventurers' guild is an excellent source of information. By studying records and working with other guild members, you can gain [[advantage]] on any attempt to research a subject in which the guild has expertise or experience.
