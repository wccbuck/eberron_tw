Although his clerical fervor is still the glue that holds the army together, some believe that Holua has softened since he founded the movement a few centuries ago. Indeed, in recent years he has spent less of his focus preaching on the conquest to come, and more on studying the prophecies surrounding the Promise of Fire, the nuances of the [[Du'rashka Tul]], and the secrets surrounding what may lie at the center of [[Gundra'kul]].\n\nA growing rift is growing between Holua and his daughter, General Xulaje, a skilled battlefield commander and master of intimidation tactics who believes it is time to mobilize the Army and make the Promise a reality.",
