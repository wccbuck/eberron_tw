Khaar'paal kobolds have an innate talent for [[arcane magic]], and many [[sorcerer]]s can be found among them. They do not work metal, but they have talented [[magewright]]s who make use of spells like [[mending]], [[prestidigitation]], [[magecraft]], and [[continual flame]], and work with exotic materials like [[quickstone]] and [[wyvern]] hide. Their [[wand]]s may night be as well-tooled as those produced by House [[Cannith]], but the Khaar'paal scouts are [[wandslinger]]s as capable as any [[Brelish|Breland]] dragoon.\n\nThe [[Droaam]] [[warlord]] [[Kethelrax the Cunning]] is a Khaar'paal [[kobold]].",
