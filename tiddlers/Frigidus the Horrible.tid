Frigidus the Horrible, a [[white|white dragon]] [[rogue dragon]] in [[Khorvaire]], compensates for his unusually small stature with delusions of grandeur (and self-appointed titles). The sole offspring of a rogue dragon, Frigidus has never laid eyes on [[Argonnessen]] and would be shocked to learn that an entire continent of [[dragon]]s has never approached him to offer him tribute. Although good-natured, Frigidus flies into a rage when not treated with what he considers proper reverence.
