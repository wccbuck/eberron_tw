The Skin Factory is the name given to the collection of slaughterhouses, butchers, and tanners found on the edge of [[Bloodstone]]. The merchants of the Skin Factory are looking for fresh meat, and PCs who bring any kill to\nthe district can get something more useful in trade,\nwhether nuggets of precious metal or preserved rations\nfor the road. The Skin Factory includes Horacâ€™s Hides,\nwhich is home to a family of [[orc]] tanners who make\nexcellent leather and hide armor. Although most of\ntheir work is mundane, grandfather Gech learned\ntricks from an [[oni]] and can produce enchanted armor.\nA PC who earns the favor of the Horacs might be\noffered a unique piece designed by Gech.",
