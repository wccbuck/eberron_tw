        "text": "This seedy tavern in the [[Calabas]] of [[Graywall]] has smoked windows, and it is identified only by the barrel-shaped trade sign hanging over the door. This sign has a single crack running through the unmarked sign. The owner is Banor Blackbarrel, an\nold [[dwarf]] brigand who used to run potent [[troll]] grog to the troops stationed along [[Breland]]'s western border. In addition to serving powerful [[Droaam]]ish spirits and sponsoring gambling, Banor runs a [[blood gin]] den in his basement—a home away from home for a growing number of dissolute exiles. Banor has contacts throughout the town, and PCs looking to find someone or something in [[Bloodstone]] could find him to be a valuable ally. But he’s a ruthless and cruel person, interested solely in his personal profit.",
