While the other scions had more personal or philosophical reasons for refusing to honor the traditional rights of succession, Thalin believed that he had a divine right to the crown. This tendency on the part of Thrane to place itself above the rest of the shattered kingdom led to some of the most terrible battles of the [[Last War]].\n\nIn 914 YK, with the death of King Thalin, [[Thrane]]’s\npeople rejected Thalin’s heir (Daslin)’s claim to the throne and\nturned to the Church of the [[Silver Flame]] for leadership. Intimidated by the church’s authority and fearing a bloody civil war if he didn’t step aside, Daslin surrendered his claim to the crown, ceding all authority to the church. Thrane became a theocracy under the rule of [[Keeper of the Flame]] Serrain, with a Wynarn \"[[blood regent|Diani ir'Wynarn]]\" serving merely as a symbolic advisor.",
