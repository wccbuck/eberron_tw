        "text": "A quarter-mile past the nominal outskirts of the city of [[Ardhmen]], a great stone arch rises over the dusty trade road. Thought to have marked the start of some great thoroughfare of the ancient city, it is the only structure beyond the docks to have withstood arcane conflict and the ravages of time.\n\nTravelers who approach [[Ardhmen]] along the road by night sometimes tell of hearing faint sound as they draw close. From the darkness ahead comes the distant noise of a bustling port cityâ€”ships' bells, uncounted voices, the clack of wagon wheels, and the roar of beasts exotic and mundane. \n\nCharacters camping within sight of the arch or passing through it might be suddenly stricken with visions of the old city of Irsthaana. Such visions might provide the party with important clues to the location of an ancient relic, or inspire contact with a current-day descendant of some figure of [[Lamecha]]'s distant past.",
