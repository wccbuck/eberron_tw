When\ntimes are dark and travelers are weary, one can always\nhope that the Wandering Inn is just beyond the horizon.\n\nThe Inn is a traveling fair and trading post that makes a regular circuit across the Plains, setting up its colorful stalls and tents\nas a gathering place for halfling tribes in the area.\nThe caravans of the Wandering Inn provide a place of\nrefuge and healing for the nomadic tribes, and even\nthose [[halfling]]s who resent [[Ghallanda]]’s movement out\nof the plains and into the wider world embrace the\nspirit of fellowship that the Wandering Inn represents.",
