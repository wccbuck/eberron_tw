This wooden wand is carved out of ash and is always faintly warm to the touch. If you are a wielder of [[primal magic]], you can cast [[flame blade]] and [[produce flame]] while attuned to this wand. You also gain an additional spellcasting [[stress]] box which you can only use to cast these spells.
