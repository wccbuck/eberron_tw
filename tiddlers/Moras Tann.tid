Moras Tann is a [[Mark of Hospitality]] foundling, the only child of a [[Ghallanda]] excoriate. His mother taught him the ways of the [[Black Dogs]], and he has lived his life according to
Dhurinda’s ideals. Today he makes his home in the city of [[Passage]], where he has a permanent [[magnificent mansion]] hidden in a run-down alleyway. He is a popular
gadabout in the taverns of [[Passage]], and plays [[Talentan|Talenta Plains]] music at a number of local [[Ghallanda]] establishments. He often provides copper coins and conjured food to the vagrants who live in his district, and has a host of friends
whose aid he can call on if pressed. 

As a vigilante assassin of the [[Black Dogs]], Moras prefers to prey
on criminals, but has recently begun to take a greater
interest in the politics of [[Passage]]—and the city’s many
corrupt officials.
