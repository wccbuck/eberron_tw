title: amulet of the night moth
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This amulet is made of a blue crystal, and seems to have a large grey moth enclosed within. While wearing this amulet in moonlight or in a [[Thelanis]] [[manifest zone]], you can manifest ethereal moth wings from your back, granting yourself the ability to fly at the same speed you can run. The wings persist for 1 hour, but become useless while you are in bright light. Once you manifest the wings, you can't do so again until the next dusk.
