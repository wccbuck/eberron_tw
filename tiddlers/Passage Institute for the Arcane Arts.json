It is a mistake to study it only in isolated towers and behind locked doors.\"//\n<<<\n<div align=\"right\">—Gallo Edgebrand, headmaster of the Passage Institute</div>\n\nMany [[arcane magic]] academies treat spellcasting and magical research as subjects best studied under isolated, highly regulated conditions. The [[Passage]] Institute, on the other hand, believes that the place to study, research, and practice magic is out in the world. The institute encourages its students to use their skills freely for the good of all—and for personal gain.\n\nThe Passage Institute accepts anyone with the interest to study spellcasting, whether they were born with the knack or not. Many of its students were unable to attend more prestigious academies such as [[Arcanix]], either due to a lack of magical aptitude or a lack of funds. Because the institute emphasizes \"practical field exercises,\" the atmosphere on campus is filled with stories of exciting exploits and fabulous treasures.\n\nWithin the academic community, the Passage Institute has a somewhat tarnished reputation, having been accused of being more of a moneymaking scheme than an organization devoted to advanced arcane study. [[Wizard|wizard]]s who are alumni of the institute are sometimes treated as second-rate casters, regardless of actual ability.",
