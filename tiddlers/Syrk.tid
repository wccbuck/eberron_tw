Syrk is the language spoken by the [[people|Syrks]] of [[Syrkarn]]. It descends from [[Riedran]], [[Khunanese]], and [[Cul'sir Giant|Giant]]. Though still classified as one language, Syrk has widely varying dialects due to the sparsely populated region of Syrkarn. For example, the [[Lamecha]]n dialect includes many loan words from [[Sylvan]], due to its [[Thelanis]] [[wild zone]]s. In the [[Sunyagir]] dialect, which derives more directly from Cul'sir Giant, a word likely has two or more different meanings based on the volume with which it is spokenâ€”speaking quietly is seen as shady and untrustworthy, and whispered words typically take on negative or even vulgar connotations.
