Orcish is the name sages give to the extinct ancestor of several [[language]]s spoken by the [[orc]] tribes of [[Khorvaire]]. The pre-[[Dhakaan]] orc civilizations of [[Khorvaire]] were long ago sundered by the [[goblinoid]] empire, and pushed to the fringes of the continent. According to the [[orc]]s of the [[Gatekeepers]], the [[dragon]] [[Vvaraak]] gave them language as well as [[primal magic]]â€”while this may be an exaggeration, modern descendants of old Orcish do have indicators of [[Draconic]] influence. 

Today, Orcish lives on in the following [[language]]s:

* [[Azhani]], the language spoken in the southern [[Shadow Marches]], which is heavily influenced by [[Dhakaani]] and old [[Ghirvagura]]n.
* [[Pukhalnum]], the language of the [[Ghaash'kala]] of the [[Labyrinth]], which is more strongly influenced by [[Abyssal]].
* The language of the [[Jhorash'tar]] of the [[Ironroot Mountains]], which includes elements of [[Dethek]].
* The language of the [[Gaa'ran orcs|orc]] in [[Droaam]], which descends from old Orcish and [[Dhakaani]].
