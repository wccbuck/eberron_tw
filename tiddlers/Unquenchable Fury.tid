While on a [[plane]] with this property, a creature has resistance against any spells or abilities that [[charm]], as well as against the [[calm emotions]] and [[sanctuary]] spells. In addition, the duration of these effects are halved. While a [[barbarian]] is raging, their rage can't be ended early unless they're knocked unconscious.
