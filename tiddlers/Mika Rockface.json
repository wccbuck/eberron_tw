        "text": "Prince Mika Rockface of the [[Cloudreavers]] is an aggressive and boisterous woman with remarkable strength and an uncanny ability to inspire terror in her enemies. She believes that she has been blessed by the [[Devourer]] and that she gains strength for every vessel she sends to the bottom of the ocean. Whether this is true or simply a delusion remains to be seen.\n\nThirty years ago, a pirate captain named [[Magwroth]] tried to usurp the [[Cloudreavers]] from Prince Mika. Magwroth was soundly defeated, last seen at the helm of his damaged ship, //Devourerâ€™s Hand//, as it limped out to sea into the gray mists of [[Lastpoint]].",
