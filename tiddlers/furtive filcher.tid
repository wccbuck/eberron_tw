//This tiny creature seems like nothing more than a wisp of shadow in a vaguely humanoid form, about eighteen inches tall. It moves with incredible quickness.//

A furtive filcher, as its name implies, is designed to steal
small items. Its size and innate stealth make this [[homunculus]] well suited
even for climbing up a person's legs to filch a wand
from their belt, for example.

A furtive filcher is shaped from clay, ashes, a pint of the
creatorâ€™s blood, and raw shadowstuff from [[Mabar]], the [[plane]] of shadows.
