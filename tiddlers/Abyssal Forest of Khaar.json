        "text": "At first glance, this seems a primeval forest, but on closer\ninspection, it's filled with horrors. The [[demiplane]] is tangled in\ncrimson vines filled with blood. It teems with monstrosities,\ntwisted beasts that aren't as alien as the [[aberration]]s of the\n[[daelkyr]], but just as deadly; even its most charming songbirds are\ncarnivorous and cruel. The forest's strange vegetation can be\nused to make potions or deadly poisons, valuable resourcesâ€”for those willing to brave its horrors. While in the Abyssal Forest of Khaar, any creature that's not naturally immune to\npoison becomes more vulnerable to poison.",
