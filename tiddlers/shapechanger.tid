type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A shapechanger is any kind of creature that has the innate ability to polymorph itself into another form. This includes [[changeling]]s, [[therianthrope]]s, [[rakshasa]]s, [[vampire]]s, [[yuan-ti]], and [[slaad]]s. This transformation is magical, but it is a truly physical transformation and not an [[illusion]]. A shapechanger's true form can be seen via [[truesight]].
