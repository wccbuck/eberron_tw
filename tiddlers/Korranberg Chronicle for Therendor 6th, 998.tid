!! Researchers Crack Code of Vvaraak

[[SHARN|Sharn]]—A [[Morgrave University]] team led by Antiquities Professor Casimir ir'Tannan announced on Wir that they've decoded the Code of [[Vvaraak]], a puzzle that has fascinated cryptographers, linguists, and historians for decades.

The Code, created more than fifteen thousand years ago by a [[dragon]] named [[Vvaraak]], is found on inscriptions in ruins across [[Khorvaire]].

"The characters and symbols in the code correspond to no known ancient [[language]]," ir'Tannan said. "But we thought we recognized some patterns in the syntax—the order in which the symbols were strung together."

The key to cracking the code, ir'Tannan said, was accumulating [[Khorvaire]]'s largest collection of Vvaraak antiquities. [[Morgrave University]] used its own researchers, expeditions from the [[Wayfinder Foundation]], and independent explorers to copy or acquire examples of Vvaraak's inscriptions.

"If you're going to decrypt something, it's important to get the largest sample you can," ir'Tannan said.

Vvaraak's inscriptions can be found on ruins across [[Khorvaire]], ir'Tannan said. The [[Lost City of Harad-Nui]] off the [[Q'barra]]n coast, the ruined Mines of Blazegold in the [[Mror Holds]], and the [[Seals of Aal'drash]] in the [[Shadow Marches]] have extensive examples of the Code of Vvaraak.

One remaining puzzle: Why the Code of Vvaraak resisted [[divination]] magic.

"We employed all sorts of divinations, but even efforts to [[commune]] or [[contact other plane]] didn't get us anywhere," ir'Tannan said. "In the end, it came down to a lot of brute-force cryptography and the extraordinary ingenuity of my team."

The team's findings, along with a complete lexicon for the Code of Vvaraak, will be published over the next several months, ir'Tannan said.

"Just as we're standing on the shoulders of great historians who came before us, I hope that our discoveries inspire the next generation of students," ir'Tannan said.

But reaction from the academic community was mixed. Athuran Happlestep, history professor emeritus at the [[Library of Korranberg]], called the effort to decrypt the Code of Vvaraak "typical [[Morgave|Morgrave University]] irresponsibility."

"We know so little of [[Vvaraak]], but we do know this: It trapped or killed a lot of strange monsters from far-off dimensions," he said. "Now that anyone can read Vvaraak's inscriptions, what's to keep tomb robbers from opening a bunch of mystic seals and unleashing horrors that the world hasn't seen for thousands of years?"

!! Freak Windstorm Wreaks Havoc With Scions Sound Shipping

[[KORTH|Korth]]—A massive windstorm on Zor left eight ships aground on the [[Karrnath]]i coast and more than two dozen vessels severely damaged.

The storm, which began shortly after nightfall, also caused extensive damage to light structures in coastal communities on both sides of [[Scions Sound]]. Gale-force western winds and high seas pushed most shipping traffic dangerously near the cliffs of [[Karrnath]], although a few vessels were able to find a measure of safety in natural harbors on the [[Aundair]]ian side of the sound.

Two vessels, the //Gleam in Her Eye// and //Saber’s Point//, were abandoned by their crews and suffered heavy damage against the cliffs. More than forty sailors from the //Saber’s Point// are missing and believed drowned, and observers say it’s unlikely the ships will be salvageable.

A trio of Karrnathi war galleys—the //Indefatigable//, the //Dauntless//, and the //Righteous Retribution//—suffered extensive hull and rigging damage. They remain anchored just east of [[Rekkenmark]], awaiting available docks for repair in [[Korth]].

[[Karrnath]]i ambassador Randarr ir’Hothelech said the crown was summoning House [[Lyrandar]] leaders to the palace to “get some answers” about the house’s ongoing weather control efforts. Due to the presence of the House [[Lyrandar]] [[enclave]] of [[Stormhome]] at the mouth of the [[Scions Sound]], storms of any kind are rare in the stretch of sound between the ocean and [[Thronehold]].

No House [[Lyrandar]] vessels were damaged in the windstorm, but Lyrandar [[wind galleons|elemental galleon]] were instrumental in rescue and recovery efforts in the storm’s aftermath.

!! Karrnath Decries New Tairnadal Fortress in Talenta Plains

[[VULYAR|Vulyar]]—Countess [[Xeria ir'Borutau]] called on the [[elves|elf]] of [[Valenar]] to cease construction of a fortress southeast of [[Vulyar]] immediately, calling the structure "a provocation that mighty [[Karrnath]] cannot ignore." Speaking during a general court audience on Zor, the countess said she was planning to petition [[Korth]] for an immediate military response to the fortress.

"No [[elf]] community exists within a two-day ride of the fort they're building, so they can't trot out the tired old self-defense claim they're so fond of," she pointed out. "This fort, if completed, will be a dagger pointed directly at the heart of eastern [[Karrnath]]."

[[Vulyar]]'s city militia is moving to a war footing at ir'Boratau's direction. The countess further stated that she's considering a supplemental levy to fund a mercenary cadre. "We can muster quite a bit of support locally right away, and I expect all of [[Karrnath]] to be behind us once word gets out," she said. "The Valenars have made a grave error, and the sooner they realize it, the better."

Warchief Shulach Miritarn in [[Taer Valaestas]] said that ir'Borutau was engaged in what he called provincial saber-rattling. "The [[Valaes Tairn]] have no designs on [[Karrnath]]," he said. "But we will defend our heritage to the death. And I hope this Karrnathi countess never has to learn the lesson inherent in those words."

Miritarn further stated that the fortress in question isn't being built so much as restored from its ruined state. "These forts—we call them taers—were guarding these lands long before [[human]]s ever set foot on [[Khorvaire]], let alone [[Karrnath]]. The Karrnathis are the interlopers, not the [[Valaes Tairn]]," he asserted.

"The [[human]]s and [[halfling]]s of eastern [[Karrnath]] and the [[Talenta Plains]] can go about their peaceful business with no interference from the [[elves|elf]]," continued Miritarn. "But if the Karrnathis threaten the reconstruction of this taer, we'll paint the plains red with their blood."
