The [[Wardens of the Wood]] have a semi-permanent camp in the Haven, and many [[Reachers|Eldeen Reaches]] visiting Sylbaran from elsewhere—especially travelers from the [[Towering Wood]]—will pitch their tents or lay their bedrolls in the Haven. As long as they mind their manners, visitors can always find a place around the bonfire.\n\n",
