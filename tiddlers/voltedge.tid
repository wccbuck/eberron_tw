This split metal sword arcs with electricity between its two halves. Attacks with this sword deal additional lightning damage. While holding this sword, you can unleash a concentrated beam of lightning from the blade in a line that is 60 feet long and 1 foot wide; creatures that can't dodge this beam suffer a great deal of lightning damage. Once this property of the sword has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
