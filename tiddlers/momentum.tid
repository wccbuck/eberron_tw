Momentum is a resource that represents the advantages a group of player characters has accumulated over the course of a scene. It can be represented by a pool of dice (ideally a different color than the dice used by the players) that can be pulled from when a player wants to improve one of their [[overcome]] rolls. The pool of momentum is shared between all players who can reasonable contribute to it or benefit from it in a scene, and can't be higher than three.

You typically add momentum to the pool by using the [[boost]] action. Other ways of gaining momentum include "overfilling" a [[progress clock]] (gain 1 momentum if an overcome fills more segments of the clock than needed to complete it), as an additional benefit for a [[critical success|full success]], or other ways as determined by the GM. 

You lose momentum by spending it after an [[overcome]] roll, either choosing to spend the point on an additional six-sided die roll, or on increasing the [[impact]] of the attempt by one level. You can also lose momentum as a [[consequence]] from an [[overcome]] roll. Finally, momentum usually persists across scenes, but is reset to 0 after a downtime.

You can also gain "temporary" momentum by [[pushing yourself|push yourself]] (1 momentum) or by spending a [[story point]] (3 momentum). "Temporary" here means that this momentum is not added to the pool, but immediately applied to the preceding attempt.
