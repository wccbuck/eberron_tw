title: Mabaran resonator
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This dread device draws on the power of [[Mabar]], infusing the dead with the malign energy of the Endless Night. While it is active, any [[humanoid]] that dies within
2 miles of the resonator reanimates 1 minute later as a [[zombie]] under the control of the creature controlling the device.
