{"created": "20210222213810151", "text": "The desert of Menechtarun dominates the western portion of the continent of [[Xen'drik]], stretching over a thousand miles in length, and its deadly heat has long\nhindered adventurers seeking to claim its secrets. This vast desert is home to the [[bhuka]] and [[asherati]], in addition to [[thri-kreen]] and [[armand]] nomads. [[Dire apes|dire beast]] and other dangerous creatures also inhabit the dunes. Along the northern edge of the desert between the [[Skyraker Claws]] and the [[Sun Pillars]], a community of sand-colored [[stone giant]]s known as the Golden Sargasso dwell, named for the bright yellow seaweed the tides of the [[Barren Sea]] bring ashore. The [[armand]] frequently trade with these giants.\n\nCountless secrets of ages past are hidden in this desert. From the top of a giant pillar in the middle of the arid wilderness, the night sky appears to hold different stars and only three moons. In the center of the desert, a mysterious glacial waste serves as the dwelling of a ravenous [[elf]] [[vampire]]. The ruined city of [[Mel-Aqat]] sits on the eastern edge of the desert, perhaps holding answers to mysteries of the [[Age of Giants]] and earlier.
