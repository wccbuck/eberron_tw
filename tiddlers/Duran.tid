The most ancient member of the [[Crimson Covenant]], Duran was the first [[human]] of the [[Five Nations]] to master the rituals required to become a [[lich]]. He also perfected many of the basic techniques of [[arcane|arcane magic]] [[necromancy]] employed by the [[Blood of Vol]].

While his will is strong, Duran's enchantments are unable to maintain his body, and he exists now as a [[demilich]]â€”a floating skull with ritually crafted soul gems in his eye sockets.
