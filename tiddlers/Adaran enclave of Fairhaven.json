Within the enclave, the [[Adarans]]\nshare their traditions and offer whatever help they\ncan to their fellow citizens. Citizens in the city consider the [[kalashtar]] and other [[Adarans]] to be valued neighbors. The ''Dome of Light'', a shrine to the [[Path of Light]], offers facilities for meditation, [[psionic|psionics]] training, and even magical healing. Adarans also attend the nearby [[University of Wynarn]] as teachers and students. Largely because of this population, the [[Knowledge Ward]] is a center for [[Sarlona]]n martial arts.",
