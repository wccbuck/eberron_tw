"Goblin" or "Dhak" is the common language of [[Darguun]] and is spoken widely in some form throughout the rest of [[Khorvaire]]. It shares much in common with its ancestor, [[Dhakaani]], a language which itself is sometimes called "High Goblin"; conversely, Goblin is sometimes referred to as "Low Dhakaani". 

Goblin has long been the common language of trade, especially in [[Droaam]]. A pidgin language called [[Gutterspeak]] spoken in the [[Cogs]] of [[Sharn]] is a fusion of Goblin with smatterings of many other language groups.
