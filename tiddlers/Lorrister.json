        "text": "Prince Lorrister of the [[Heavenly Fleet]] is a planetouched [[aasimar]] of [[Irian]] and [[paladin]] of [[Dol Arrah]]. He appears as a human but for his massive white wings with black tips on the primary feathers, resembling the wings of a pelican. He is dedicated to bringing justice and order to the \"uncivilized\" [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. \n\nPrince Lorrister might come to the aid of player\ncharacters facing the perils of the [[Lhazaar Sea]], sailing to\nthe rescue like some celestial cavalry riding over the hill.\nHowever, he is likely to ask characters who are indebted to\nhim to return the favor by striking against one of his many\nenemies. He is on a perpetual crusade against evil in the\nPrincipalities, and he recognizes the [[Cloudreavers]] as his\ngreatest enemies. He also bears a particular grudge against\nthe [[Emerald Claw]] and actively campaigns in opposition to\nthat order’s activities.\n\nThe other princes scoff at Prince Lorrister’s morals,\nbut they are leery of his strength. In the future they might\nform an alliance to destroy the paladin and his crusaders,\nbut for now they use their wiles to play him against their\nfoes. For his part, Lorrister may be idealistic, but he is not\nnaive, and he remains fully aware of his rivals’ plans.",
