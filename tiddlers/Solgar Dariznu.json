        "text": "The Archbishop Solgar Dariznu, formerly of [[Wyr]] in western [[Aundair]], governs [[Thaliost]] with the aid of a detachment of [[Thrane]] knights. Despite exhortations from the [[Council of Cardinals]] for him to be lenient, he rules savagely, using excessive force whenever and wherever thereâ€™s trouble. His knights round up treasonous ringleaders, stage trials, and at times burn prisoners alive in public to dissuade others from following their example. Citizens face random searches, invasion and seizure of property, and imposition of heavy fines for minor infractions. His methods have quelled the worst of the violence and pacified most of the population, but the people despise him. Many observers inside and outside Thrane wonder when the archbishop will finally overstep so much that he sparks a devastating uprising.\n\nDariznu is sympathetic to the cause of the [[Pure Flame]] sect.",
