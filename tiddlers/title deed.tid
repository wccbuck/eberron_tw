Possession might be nine-tenths of the law in the wilder parts of the world, but throughout the [[Five Nations]], a deed is required to prove ownership of buildings, land, [[airship]]s, and other property of significant size and value. Title deeds are not carried by the owner, but are rather kept under lock and key in a safe location. They are large documents prepared by House [[Sivis]] on oversized sheets of parchment, bearing a detailed description of both property (particularly identifying marks or measurements) and owner, a history of the property's previous ownership, and a pair of [[arcane mark]]s. Title deeds are considered extremely difficult documents to forge.

Title deeds are issued by national governmentsâ€”sometimes through local or regional offices, sometimes by courier from the national capital.
