tooltip: universal property: the passage of time is different, but consistent, in different layers of this plane
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While on a [[plane]] with this property, the passage of time varies between the plane's [[layer]]s. In many, time passes at the same rate as on the Material Plane; if you spend an hour fighting in the [[Burning Sky]] of [[Shavarath]], an hour passes in Eberron. But other layers move at different speeds; you can spend a month in the trenches of [[Nullius Terram]] and find that less than three days have passed in Eberron.
