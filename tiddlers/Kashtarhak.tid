The [[rakshasa]] Kashtarhak, the Voice of Chaos, is the chosen servant of the [[overlord]] [[Eldrantulku]]. The [[Draconic Prophecy]] has revealed that Eldrantulku will rise again when a mighty empire tears itself apart from within. Kashtarhak helped instigate the elven uprising in [[Xen'drik]] during the [[Age of Giants]], and played a part in shattering the Empire of [[Dhakaan]]. Now he whispers in the shadows of [[Khorvaire]], hoping to bring down the last remnants of [[Galifar]]. His underlings encourage anti-monarchy groups and those who wish to see the war begin anew.
