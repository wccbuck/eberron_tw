tags: [[Lhazaar Principalities]] island
title: Orthoss
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The icy island of Orthoss in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] is a haven for the [[Khoravar|half-elf]], and half-elves from across [[Khorvaire]] have found their way to the town of [[Blackrock]]. Notably, the Lhazaar lifestyle has attracted a number of members of House [[Medani]] and House [[Lyrandar]] over the centuries—young rebels seeking an escape from the smothering traditions of their [[houses|dragonmarked house]]. Their blood has been spread across the island, and it has been spread quite thin—but occasionally a child of Orthoss develops a [[dragonmark]].

The town of [[Blackrock]] is the seat of power of the [[Wind Whisperers]].
