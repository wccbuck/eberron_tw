The [[Knights of Thrane]] [[militia]] in [[Stormreach]] are led by Valen Vanatar, the grandson of one of the original knights. He is a popular figure among the [[Wynarn|Wynarn family]] loyalists.

He believes the [[Blood of Vol]] and worship of the [[Dark Six]] pose a threat to the stability of Embers and acts accordingly.
