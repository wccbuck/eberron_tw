        "text": "Joliana ir'Wynarn was the ruler of the kingdom of [[Galifar]] from [[558 YK|Khorvaire calendar]] until her death in 560 YK, having previously served as governor of [[Thrane]]. She succeeded her older sister [[Marala|Marala ir'Wynarn]], who had no living heirs. A devoted [[Flamist|Silver Flame]], Queen Joliana attempted to establish the Church of the [[Silver Flame]] as the \"one true\" state religion of Galifar immediately following her coronation; her motives for this crusade are debated by scholars, but the leading theory considers it a reaction to the recent carnage of the [[Talons of Ice|Saeria Lantol]] during the reign of her sister. In any case, a few bloody clashes almost led to civil war before Joliana died suddenly and mysteriously before the end of the second year of her reign.",
