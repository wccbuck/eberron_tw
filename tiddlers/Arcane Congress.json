        "text": "The mentors at [[Arcanix]] comprise the Arcane Congress, a council of spellcasters\nwho explore the limits of the arcane arts under a mandate instituted by King [[Galifar I|Galifar Wynarn]]. \n\nThe royal warlord and minister of magic, [[Adal|Adal ir'Wynarn]], serves\nas the go-between for the [[Aundair]] crown and the congress, though\nsome factions within the congress distrust Adal due to his fascination with war and weapons of arcane destruction. In addition to providing Queen [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]] with advice on arcane matters, the congress oversees the floating towers of wizardry in [[Arcanix]] and helps mentor the next generation of [[wizard]]s and [[artificer]]s. \n\nThe Arcane Congress competes with the [[Twelve]] in recruiting promising students of magic.",
