When the kingdom collapsed at the beginning of the [[Last War]], the Congress swore its allegiance to the [[Aundair]]ian throne.\n\nThe royal warlord and minister of magic, [[Adal|Adal ir'Wynarn]], serves\nas the go-between for the [[Aundair]] crown and the congress, though\nsome factions within the congress distrust Adal due to his fascination with war and weapons of arcane destruction. \n\nIn addition to providing Queen [[Aurala|Aurala ir'Wynarn]] with advice on arcane matters, the congress oversees the floating towers of wizardry in [[Arcanix]] and helps mentor the next generation of [[wizard]]s and [[artificer]]s. The Arcane Congress competes with the [[Twelve]] in recruiting promising students of magic.",
