Gul Dol, the Gate of War, is a permanent [[wild zone]] to [[Shavarath]] near the center of the [[Riedra]]n province of [[Borunan]]. Here, a fragment of the Eternal Battleground extends directly into the Material Plane. The [[ogre]]s of the pre-[[Sundering]] nation of Borunan devoted their might to defending this region against the forces of tyranny, and it's possible that this struggle led to the first [[oni]].

The [[angel]]s of the [[Legion|legion of Shavarath]] of [[Freedom]] battle the [[devil]]s of the Legion of [[Tyranny]] for control of this massive fortress, which is broken into multiple rings and wings. The angels believe that the balance of this war reflects the balance between tyranny and freedom across the multiverse. Of course, this is only one of countless fronts in the eternal war between these forces, but the [[ogre]]s embraced this idea and believed that in fighting alongside the angels they were fighting for freedom for all people.

Today, the majority of the Gate of War is in the hands of the Legion of [[Tyranny]], but the [[angel]]s still hold an isolated keep. Their forces include a number of [[Borunan]] sword wraithsâ€”the spectral vestiges of the [[ogre]]kin champions that fought and died alongside them.
