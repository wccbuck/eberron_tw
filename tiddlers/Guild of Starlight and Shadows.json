Members of the larger [[Esoteric Order of Aureon]] often look down\non Starlight [[wizard]]s, and in turn the guild members\noften mock the wizards of the Esoteric Order and play\npranks on them. In [[Sharn]], the Guild of Starlight and Shadows\nhas its hall in the [[Deathsgate]] district in [[Middle Tavick's Landing]]. \n\nThe Guild of Starlight and Shadows has its roots in the [[Guild of Moonlight and Whispers]], the oldest wizard's circle in [[Khorvaire]].",
