type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This pendant is shaped like a large feline claw, and is etched with geometric designs. It allows the wearer to communicate fluently with all feline creatures. Cats, panthers, lions, and other such felines will behave amicably towards the wearer, and are more likely to aid the wearer when called upon.
