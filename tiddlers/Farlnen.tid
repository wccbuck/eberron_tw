tags: [[Lhazaar Principalities]] island
title: Farlnen
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The frozen island of Farlnen is part of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. It is defined by its patchwork of [[Mabar]]an [[manifest zone]]s, as well as [[Port Cairn]], the seat of power of the [[Bloodsails]].

In the aftermath of the destruction of the [[line|Aereni noble line]] of [[Vol]], many [[Aereni]] were exiled from their homeland and sailed north, finding their way to Farlnen and making a new home in the long shadow of the Fingerbone Mountains. Today, many [[elves|elf]] choose to remain in isolated communities deep in the Fingerbones, but others have embraced [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] culture and the life of the sea. The largest of these is the [[Bloodsail|Bloodsails]] principality, centered in [[Port Cairn]].

High in the mountains, protected by the hostile environment as well as powerful [[abjuration]]s, is the fortress of [[Lady Illmarrow]].

!! The Black Isle

Farlnen is cold and bleak, with cliffs of basalt and beaches covered with black sand. When the [[elves|elf]] came to the island, they found almost no vegeta­tion; Farlnen is close to the [[plane]] of [[Mabar]], and full sunlight never reaches its stony soil. The [[Grim Lord|Grim Lords]] [[Varonaen]] overcame this challenge, and the fruits of his labors can be seen today: [[darkwood]] trees and [[ebon sedge]] grass that feed on shadows instead of sunlight. Varonaen has continued his work over the course of generations, and the merchants of Farlnen trade spices and wines that cannot be produced any­where else in the world.

The waters around the island are just as danger­ous as the stories say. Basalt columns and treacherous reefs pose inanimate threats to those who don’t know the coastline, and the [[undead]] sentinels pose an even greater threat. Anything that roamed the water over the centuries might have been slain at some point and bound to protect Farlnen. [[Kraken|kraken]]s? [[Dragon turtle|dragon turtle]]s? Worse? It’s up to the GM to decide what lies hidden in the dark water.

!! The Faces of Farlnen

Farlnen is a dark reflection of [[Aerenal]]. The cities are made of basalt and [[darkwood]], and the [[sun|Sun]] never pierces the [[Mabar]]an haze that hangs over the island. Most of the [[elves|elf]] who reside there have pale com­plexions, as one might expect in such a sunless land. However, children conceived when Mabar is coterminous are sometimes born with jet­-black skin; such elves can be mistaken for [[drow]]. 

Although [[Bloodsail|Bloodsails]] merchants and privateers are found across the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] and the [[Bitter Sea]], strangers receive a cold welcome in Farlnen. [[Port Cairn]] is the gateway to the island and the seat of Prince [[Tasil|Shaen Tasil]], but any visitor quickly realizes that the place has few families. It is home to travelers and those who cater to them, but the family estates lie in the interior and the Fingerbone Mountains. Foreign­ers who want to travel into the interior of Farlnen are treated with suspicion or hostility; it is all but impos­sible to find a guide unless the traveler is an [[elf]] or has some other connection to the [[Bloodsails]] or [[Grim Lords]].

Farlnen is primarily inhabited by elves, along with a handful of [[eladrin]] and [[half­-elves|half-elf]]. The eladrin arrived eighteen hundred years ago, fleeing a disaster in [[Thelanis]]; they have fully embraced the [[Bloodsail|Bloodsails]] culture and married into elf families. Members of other races might be accepted as guests, but there is no place for [[human]]s on the Black Isle.
