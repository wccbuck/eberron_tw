[[Alchemist|alchemist]]s claim that the jask root is the most nutritious vegetable that can be grown in [[Khorvaire]]. The root was first discovered in the [[Talenta Plains]], where it is a staple of [[halfling]] diet. However, most [[human]]s—especially human children—are revolted by the taste of jask root. As a result, roots are typically served with thick, sugary glaze in human-majority cities.
