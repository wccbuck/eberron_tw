Vvaraak, also known as the Ebon Mother and the Scaled Apostate, was a [[black dragon]] who taught the secrets of [[primal magic]] to the [[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]] [[druid]]s over fifteen thousand years ago. Locations in western [[Khorvaire]] where she dwelled and taught ([[Vvaraak's Lair]] and the [[Mystic Glade]], respectively) still bear lingering magic from her presence, but are shielded from all [[divination]] magic, and their precise locations are unknown.

!! Vvaraak's Betrayal

Throughout time, [[rogue dragon]]s have pursued their own agendas and dreams. Still, in the aftermath of [[Aureon's Folly|Age of Giants]] and the destruction of [[Xen'drik]], few dared to share the secrets of [[Argonnessen]] with lesser creatures. One such rebel was was Vvaraak, the [[black dragon]] who trained the first [[Gatekeepers]], and brought the secrets of [[druidic magic|primal magic]] to [[Khorvaire]]. A true [[child of Eberron]], Vvaraak foresaw a disaster that would wound the world itself. The [[Conclave]] had no interest in this struggle; just as the [[dragon]]s had stood aside while the [[giant]]s of [[Xen'drik]] battled [[Dal Quor]], the elders of the Conclave told Vvaraak that they
would act when a clear threat to [[Argonnessen]] existed, and not before.

Frustrated, Vvaraak abandoned her elders and her flight, traveled across the world, and began training [[humanoid]]s and other creatures in the use of natural magic. Although she is best known for teaching the [[orc]]s of the [[west coast|Shadow Marches]] of [[Khorvaire]], Vvaraak had other students. Some [[Seren]] [[druid]]s attribute their skill to
the teachings of the Ebon Mother, and [[lizardfolk]] in [[Xen'drik]] boast traditions akin to the [[Gatekeepers]]. Vvaraak stayed in the [[Shadow Marches]] for less than a century, and her final fate is unknown. Perhaps she lived out her final
days in [[humanoid]] form, moving among her students
and hiding from the angry [[Eyes of Chronepsis]]. Perhaps she descended into [[Khyber]] to teach the denizens of the deep. Some say that she returned to [[Argonnessen]], that her act of rebellion was actually a carefully calculated move on behalf of the [[Conclave]]. If so, it could be that the dragons subtly planned and implemented both the destruction of the [[Dhakaan]]i Empire and the defeat of the [[daelkyr]].

Of course, itâ€™s possible that the [[Xoriat]] incursion was
not the threat Vvaraak foresaw. If this is the case, what
monumental danger still lies ahead?
