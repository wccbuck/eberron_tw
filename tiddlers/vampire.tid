Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor [[sunlight|Sun]], for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.

Most of a vampire's victims become //vampire spawn//â€”ravenous creatures ([[tier 2|creature tier]]) with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies. However, even if a spawn breaks free from a true vampire's control, weak-willed vampire spawn often devolve into feral predators, true monsters who see all living creatures as prey.

!! Vampire Abilities and Weaknesses

The following abilities and weaknesses apply to vampires created through the [[Qabalrin]] [[necromantic|necromancy]] tradition (see the Vampire Origins section below). Vampires of the [[Bone King]] or other entities may have different abilities or weaknesses.

A vampire's abilities include the following: 

* While a vampire is not in [[sunlight|Sun]] or running water, it can transform into a bat or a cloud of mist. If air can pass through a space, so can a vampire in mist form. A vampire can enter mist form instinctively (if able) when it is incapacitated, flying back to its resting place and recuperating.
* Vampires are resistant to [[necrotic damage|damage type]] and all physical attacks that are non-magical.
* Vampires also rapidly regenerate from harm. This effect can be suppressed if the vampire suffers [[radiant damage|damage type]] or comes into contact with [[holy water]].
* A vampire can effortlessly climb along vertical and upside down surfaces such as ceilings.
* A vampire can magically charm [[humanoid]]s. This is similar to the spell [[charm]], except the charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected, and the effect lasts up to 24 hours.
* A vampire can magically summon swarms of bats, rats, or wolves, provided that the [[Sun]] isn't up.
* A vampire has a powerful form of [[darkvision]], and is able to see clearly in pitch-black conditions.

Vampires of the [[Qabalrin]] strain have the following weaknesses:

* A vampire suffers harm (as radiant damage) whenever it is in [[sunlight|Sun]]; it also suffers [[disadvantage]] on all attempts.
* A vampire suffers harm if it spends more than a few seconds in running water.
* A vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants. 
* If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while it is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is completely paralyzed until the stake is removed.

As mentioned above, different strains of vampire have different abilities and weaknesses. For example, perhaps vampires of the [[Bone King]] are not harmed by running water, but are vulnerable to fire. The table below offers some ideas for interesting traits for vampires of different origins:

| !<<dr d12>> |!Vampire Trait |
| 1 |''//Cleansing Flame.//'' The vampire is vulnerable to fire. While it can see an open flame that's 3 feet tall or higher, it becomes frightened and distracted. (replaces running water weakness) |
| 2 |''//Compulsive Counting.//'' If a creature casts seeds (or similar small object) in front of the vampire, the vampire feels a strong compulsion to stop whatever it's doing and count the seeds. |
| 3 |''//Deathless Binding.//'' If a ring of [[targath]] is fixed around the vampire's finger, hands, or neck, the vampire becomes paralyzed until the ring is removed. (replaces stake through the heart weakness) |
| 4 |''//Drawn to Decay.//'' If the vampire sees one or more creatures suffer [[necrotic damage|damage type]], it is drawn to the creature it saw suffer the most. The vampire must (if able) move as close as possible to the creature, avoiding obvious hazards, or suffer radiant damage. |
| 5 |''//Keeper's Greed.//'' The vampire must accept any gift offered to it. |
| 6 |''//Lunar Herding.//'' The vampire has [[disadvantage]] on all attempts on any night with more than one full [[moon]]. (replaces running water weakness) |
| 7 |''//Never Look Back.//'' Once the vampire leaves a building, it can't reenter the building for 13 days. (replaces weakness requiring permission to enter a residence) |
| 8 |''//Odds and Evens.//'' The vampire is vulnerable to being stabbed or pierced on each even-numbered day of the month, and immune to it on each odd-numbered day of the month. |
| 9 |''//One for the Keeper.//'' If the vampire hears a creature speak a list of five connected things, it must either name a sixth connected thing, or suffer two [[stress]]. |
| 10 |''//Perfect Etiquette.//'' When asked a question, if the vampire's name is spoken as part of the question, the vampire must truthfully answer. This answer can be brief or cryptic. (replaces weakness requiring permission to enter a residence) |
| 11 |''//Slithering Shadow.//'' The vampire can become a poisonous snake, or a swarm of them. (replaces bat and mist form) |
| 12 |''//Unfaceable.//'' The vampire is frightened of images of itself. |

!! Vampire Origins

Unlike [[zombie]]s and [[ghoul]]s, vampires are a form of [[undead]] that are never generated spontaneously by [[Mabar]]an [[manifest zone]]s; creating a vampire is an act of epic [[necromancy]] that infuses a [[humanoid]] creature with the power of [[Mabar]]. The first known vampires were created by the [[Qabalrin]] [[elves|elf]] during the [[Age of Giants]], and the line of [[Vol]] resurrected these techniques to create a number of vampire bloodlines on [[Aerenal]]. When the [[Undying Court]] eradicated the line of Vol, its allies were allowed to flee; some settled on the island of [[Farlnen]] and founded the [[Bloodsail Principality|Bloodsails]], while others spread west, mingling with the [[human]]s in what is now [[Karrnath]] and laying the foundation for the [[Blood of Vol]] faith. These elves brought vampires with them, and most vampires in [[Khorvaire]] can ultimately trace their bloodlines back to Aerenal. 

One of the oldest vampires on [[Khorvaire]] is the [[hobgoblin]] [[dirge singer]] [[Iraala]] of the [[Kech Nasaar]], who became a vampire through dealings with the line of [[Vol]] before the [[Empire|Dhakaan]] fell, and even before the [[Mark of Death]] manifested. So even vampires who trace their lineage to the Kech Nasaar ultimately lead back to [[Aerenal]].

[[Qabalrin]] techniques are the common source of vampires, but other paths exist. For example, the [[Bone King]] of [[Mabar]] can transform a mortal into a vampire. Such vampires cannot spawn other vampires; most instead transform victims into [[ghoul]]s. When they are destroyed, their spirits are drawn to the domain of the Bone King, where the exist as [[wraith]]s. Additionally, there are a few examples of devotees of the [[Keeper]] becoming vampires. These vampires do not create "spawn", and their hunger is a manifestation of the greed of the Keeper, and the souls of creatures they slay may be bound, similar to the effect of a [[Keeper's Fang]]. Other forms of vampire might exist, perhaps tied to [[Katashka]], the princes of [[Ohr Kaluun]], or an evil [[archfey]].
