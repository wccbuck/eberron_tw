        "text": "The Seadragon Principality, led by High Prince [[Ryger ir'Wynarn]], is largest of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]—which is to say, Ryger’s personal followers and the twenty ships under their command form the largest fleet in the [[Lhazaar Sea]], allowing them to control the largest swath of territory. Most of these ships, including Prince Ryger’s flagship, //Dragoneye//, make their home port at [[Regalport]], [[Greentarn]], but the principality also claims the islands of [[Orgalos]], [[Crown Island]], [[Speartip]], [[Ninebay Island]], [[Redwatch]], and [[Thrug]].\n\nThe Seadragons have been staunch allies of [[Q'barra]], helping this fledging nation while gaining access to Q'barran [[dragonshard]]s. The Seadragons also have cultivated a business partnership with House [[Orien]], acting as a merchant and courier fleet throughout the [[Lhazaar Principalities]].",
