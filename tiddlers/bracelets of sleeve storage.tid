type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

These two bracelets are each tied to a small volume of extradimensional space. They are woven from strings of red and glass white beads. While wearing the bracelets, one can store up to 20 pounds of items in each sleeve. There are no outward signs of the objects, and the user does not feel their weight. If the bracelets or clothing are removed, the objects will immediately spill out of the sleeves.

Placing these bracelets inside an extradimensional space
created by a [[bag of holding]], [[portable hole]], or similar item
instantly destroys both items.
