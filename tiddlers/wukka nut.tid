title: wukka nut
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

These fist-sized nuts grow on wukka trees, which are popular haunts for [[jaculi]], [[su-monster]]s, and [[zorbo]]s. A wukka nut rattles when shaken, causing its shell to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. This magical light fades after 1 minute, but shaking the nut again causes the light to reappear. If the shell of the nut is cracked open, it loses its magic.
