This magically gifted member of the [[Broken Throne]] in [[Dar Jin]] might be a street sweeper, a dock worker, a clerk in the
[[Mercantile Center]], or in any number of other guises. If
the PCs come to his attention, Rhuun might seek them out,
perhaps asking their help in exploring a ruin of the [[Twelve Kingdoms|Sarlonan province]]. Of course, while Rhuun claims to be a Broken Throne devotee seeking to restore lost knowledge, he could in fact be one of the [[Heirs of Ohr Kaluun]]â€”in which case he
could be considerably more powerful and dangerous.
