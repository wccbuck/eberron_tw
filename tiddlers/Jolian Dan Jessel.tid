Jolian Dan Jessel was a famed arcane cartographer. In 750 YK, he promised to present the
[[Library of Korranberg]] with the first true map of [[Argonnessen]]. Before the work was completed, Jolianâ€™s workshop was burned to the ground, and the [[gnome]] himself was never found. Few events escape the [[Eyes of Chronepsis]], and the wise leave Argonnessen be.
