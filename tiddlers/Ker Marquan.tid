In the ruins of Ker Marquan, a titan king sits atop his throne on the path to the [[timeless fountain]], dreaming of the [[empire|Age of Giants]] he once ruled. This last king of [[Xen'drik]] possesses dreadful secrets, but remains bound to the fountain of immortality. So he waits for someone to come, to ask the question he must answer in order that he be freed.
