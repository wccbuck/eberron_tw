tooltip: merfolk of the Thunder Sea who tend to dangerous manifest zones
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Children of the [[Endless Ocean]] of [[Lamannia]], the [[merfolk]]
have been drawn into [[Eberron]] time and again during grand
convergences between the [[plane]]s. Merfolk can be found
across the seas of Eberron, and every //kara//—tribe—has its own
traditions and customs. The primary merfolk culture in the
[[Thunder Sea]] is Karakala, whose members call themselves
the Kalamer.

The [[Thunder Sea]] has many strong [[manifest zone]]s to
[[Lamannia]], the source of the endless storms that give the
region its name. Nearly two centuries ago, an unusually strong
convergence amplified the effects of the manifest zones. Both
the [[Valraean Protectorate]] and the [[Eternal Dominion]] were
lashed by the power of Lamannia, and there were fears that
the barrier between worlds could be permanently damaged.
At the height of this disaster, Kalamer [[merfolk]] were pulled
through from Lamannia; finding themselves without a means
to return home, they used their rites and rituals to contain
and repair the damage. These wild zones in the upper waters have always been a threat, and once it became clear that Karakala could mitigate the danger, both the [[sahuagin]] and [[sea elves|sea elf]] agreed to give them freedom to travel in the upper
waters, so long as they managed the [[manifest zone]]s. Today,
many Kalamer consider the [[Thunder Sea]] their new home, and
travel from zone to zone, practicing their [[primal|primal magic]] traditions. In
a sense, they’re nomadic gardeners, preserving the wild. As
they’re recognized as neutral by both the [[Dominion|Eternal Dominion]] and the
[[Protectorate|Valraean Protectorate]], they often serve as messengers, couriers, and
mediators, carrying news and negotiating on behalf of these
powers—an important role, as the [[sahuagin]] refuse to speak
directly to the [[sea elves|sea elf]]. The reach of Karakala extends along
the southern coast of [[Khorvaire]], and the arrival of a Kalamer
[[bard]] is often a celebrated event in small [[Brelish|Breland]] or [[Zil|Zilargo]] fishing
villages; more than once, they’ve managed to settle disputes between fisherfolk and the Dominion.

Overall, Karakala is a neutral force, concerned above all
with traveling between the [[manifest zone]]s—which they call
the roots—and performing the rituals that keep them stable.
However, there are Kalamer pods who quietly despise those
who bend nature for their own benefit—dryskin, [[sahuagin]],
and [[sea elf]] alike—and especially oppose the use of [[elemental binding]]; these have come to see House [[Lyrandar]] as their foes.
There are Kalamer who dream of someday cleansing the
oceans of all traces of industry, of unleashing the full power of
the [[manifest zone]]s instead of keeping them contained. To date,
Karakala has maintained its peaceful course, but it’s always
possible that their darker impulses will rise to the fore—that
they’ll show House [[Lyrandar]] and the nations of the world the
true power of the storm.

!! Culture

The Kalamer are a primal people, feeling the currents, tides,
and winds in a profound way; some say that the ocean sings a
song. Consider these philosophies when dealing with [[merfolk]]
of Karakala:

* //“The water is always moving; follow it, let the currents guide you.”// Kalamer prefer to remain in motion, and deeply rely on instinct and intuition.
* //“Flow around a problem or away from it.”// Kalamer value flexibility over pride and aggression.
* //“Keep only that which lifts you up, not what drags you down.”// Kalamer avoid anything that anchors them too strongly to one place or mood, including property and vendettas.
* //“Make no judgment until you know the story.”// Kalamer are naturally curious and seek to understand the people and things they encounter.

Karakala is a culture rather than a nation. There are
approximately ten thousand Kalamer spread across the
[[Thunder Sea]], but they claim no territory and have no single
leader. Most live in small pods, following a pattern of migration
between the [[manifest zone]]s of the upper water. When they
reach a manifest zone, they remain there for a week or so,
performing [[primal|primal magic]] rituals that stabilize the zone. They prize
manifest zones to [[Lamannia]], and time spent at a Lamannian
zone is a time of celebration. However, they travel to all
manifest zones, and their rituals can contain the harmful
effects of any [[manifest zone]].

The Kalamer don’t worship deities, but revere the forces of
nature and believe the world speaks to those who listen. While
outsiders might view this as worshiping [[Eberron]], the Kalamer
don’t need to anthropomorphize nature for it to be worthy of
reverence. The Kalamer value wisdom over strength, and the
leader of the pod holds that position because the others trust
their instincts; often they’re an elder, but age isn’t a requirement.

In general, Karakala is peaceful; this is one reason both the
[[Dominion|Eternal Dominion]] and [[Protectorate|Valraean Protectorate]] allow the Kalamer to move freely. Most [[merfolk]] seek to understand any threats they encounter,
to see if they can find a way to coexist—or failing that, to simply
move past the danger. However, they can be dangerous foes
when they’re forced to act or encounter a true threat to the
balance of nature.

Kalamer fashion is simple and functional. It’s rare for Kalamer
to wear anything heavier than leather armor, and most just wear
leather straps to hold their tools and personal possessions.
Many carry small tokens—shells, stones, bones—that remind
them of a place or moment. Sometimes [[human]]s describe
hearing the sound of the ocean in a shell; however, many
Kalamer truly receive primal impressions from natural objects.

Kalamer speak [[Aquan|Primordial]], their native tongue from [[Lamannia]].
Most of them also speak either [[Elvish|Aerenese]], [[Common]], or [[Sahuagin]],
depending on where their route takes them, and [[merfolk]] [[bard]]s
may speak all of these. Any Kalamer capable of channeling [[primal magic]] can speak [[Druidic]], which they consider to be the language of the wind and water.

!! Territory

The [[merfolk]] of Karakala can be found across the [[Thunder Sea]]; Kalamer pods follow migratory patterns, while wandering [[siren]]s let intuition guide them. The Kalamer remain in the upper waters where sunlight allows photosynthesis. There are
no Kalamer cities, but they establish simple outposts along
their migratory paths, often in masses of floating vegetation
(which are especially common in [[Lamannia]]n [[manifest zone]]s).
Many pods bond with a [[drake turtle]], which serves as the
locus of the pod; the [[merfolk]] strap themselves to the turtle
when they sleep. Unlike the drake turtles of the [[Eternal Dominion]], this is a symbiotic relationship; the merfolk help their companion find food and keep the drake entertained. Other pods bond with gargantuan beasts that have
passed into [[Eberron]] from [[Lamannia]].

!! Tools and Traditions

Karakala has no tradition of [[wizard]]ry or [[artifice|artificer]]. However,
most Kalamer possess at least a touch of [[primal magic]], and
can shape water or strike a foe with a thunderclap; this can
be reflected by giving Kalamer [[merfolk]] a [[common- or uncommon-tier|spell tier]] [[primal magic]] [[spell]]. Kalamer with greater gifts are called [[stormcaller]]s, and can summon lightning and wind. Kalamer champions could possess the abilities of [[ranger]]s or [[druid]]s, and might be able to assume the forms of deadly sea creatures.

Other Kalamer hear music in the motion of wind and water
and become [[bard]]s. Kalamer [[siren]]s can weave [[illusion]]s with
their words, or cloud the minds of enemies. These sirens often
travel alone, sharing news and songs both with Kalamer pods
and with all other ships and communities they come across.
While most Kalamer bards seek to bring joy to everyone they
encounter, there are stories of sirens turned bitter after the
destruction of a pod or witnessing great cruelty; these merfolk
may turn their powers to punishing those they see as evil.
Kalamer bards generally rely on their voices as opposed to
using instruments, and can sing while submerged.

The people of Karakala create their tools from natural
materials—stone, shell, leather, bone. Their [[magic item]]s—
mostly potions, amulets, and charms—produce [[primal|primal magic]] effects.

!! Foreign Relations

Karakala is politically neutral, holding no nation or people
above any other. A [[siren]] or pod may have a strong bond to a
particular fishing village, but that affection doesn’t extend to the
dryskin nation that claims it. Generally, Karakala tries to ignore
the actions of nations, focusing on its never-ending pilgrimage,
though individual Kalamer—[[siren]]s, [[triton|merfolk]] champions—may
become more actively involved with a single nation.

While they maintain their neutrality and serve as messengers
and couriers between all the people of the sea, Karakala
doesn’t like the [[Eternal Dominion]] or the [[Valraean Protectorate]].
The Kalamer dislike seeing any creature held in bondage,
and they may help renegade [[locathah]] or smugglers sailing
beyond approved Dominion routes. However, while they may
help peaceful smugglers, they dislike cruelty and greed; violent
pirates can find that the [[merfolk]] are just as dangerous as
House [[Lyrandar]] or a Dominion patrol.

To date, Karakala has been a passive, mediating force,
trusted by all. But the fact remains that Kalamer dislike all
forms of industry in the sea. If it were an option, many Kalamer
would destroy all dryskin shipping and shatter the cities of
the [[Dominion|Eternal Dominion]] and [[Protectorate|Valraean Protectorate]] alike. Currently, they work to contain the [[manifest zone]]s of the [[Thunder Sea]] and to keep
peace; but if they chose, they could instead release the power
of these zones to terrible effect. Hostile Kalamer could begin
by calling [[elder tempest]]s and megafauna beasts from
[[Lamannia]] and unleashing them into shipping lanes, increasing
the dangers of the sea—with plausible deniability as to their
source. By coordinating rituals with coterminous periods, the
Kalamer could dramatically enhance the effects of [[manifest zone]]s. Using the [[Lamannia]] zones in this way, they could create devastating hurricanes and tsunamis. Could tidal waves devastate [[Stormreach]], or elemental hurricanes topple one of
the towers of [[Sharn]]? Karakala has no interest in conquest; if
the [[merfolk]] pursued this course of action, it would purely be to
drive commerce and civilization from the sea.

!! Story Hooks

The Kalamer aren’t conquerors. What could draw them into a
story? Consider the following ideas.

//''The Traveling Siren.''// As adventurers visit a coastal town,
they hear a beautiful, clear song rising from the harbor and
see people running towards the pier. Aside from being an interesting scene,
the [[siren]] could bring news that’s directly relevant to the
adventurers—perhaps news of a ship they were waiting for that
was sunk offshore, or perhaps they’ll share a story of a ruin
hidden off the coast. As sirens act as intermediaries, a bard
could also come carrying a message for the adventurers from
a powerful figure in the [[Dominion|Eternal Dominion]] or [[Protectorate|Valraean Protectorate]].

//''Salvation at Sea.''// Perhaps the characters’ ship leaves the
safe trade routes and runs afoul of an endless storm. Or maybe
they’re simply crippled by pirates, or by a forgotten weapon of
the [[Last War]]. A pod of Kalamer can save the characters, using
[[primal magic]] to allow the dryskins to breathe underwater, helping them to safety. But do the Kalamer need something in return? A powerful [[monstrosity]] could be lurking around a [[manifest zone]], preventing the pod from performing their rituals. Or an [[aboleth]] serving the [[Lurker in Shadow]] may have captured
members of their pod; they need help to defeat the beast.

//''The Vengeful Storm.''// Though Kalamer are peaceful, the
[[stormcaller]] Llaratala can no longer share the water with House
[[Lyrandar]] and its oppression of [[elemental]]s. She and her pod
are targeting [[elemental galleon]]s, shattering Lyrandar ships and
freeing the bound spirits. The house hires the adventurers to
find out who’s responsible for the destruction of their vessels.
How will the characters track the [[merfolk]] mastermind, and
what will they choose to do?

//''Druidic Allies.''// A Kalamer hails the [[druid]] of the party
while the adventurers are on the coast or on a ship. The
[[stormcaller]] addresses them in Druidic, as a fellow defender
of the natural world, asking them to help deal with an unnatural
threat. This could be an [[aboleth]] or [[aberration]], or a danger
posed by a [[manifest zone]]—such as [[Mabar]] or [[Fernia]]—that’s
experiencing a wild surge and steadily growing worse. Can the
[[druid]] and their companions help contain the threat?

//''Intermediaries.''// The Kalamer act as couriers and envoys
between the [[Valraean Protectorate]] and the [[Eternal Dominion]].
While sailing, the adventurers come upon a dead Kalamer. The
message it was carrying could be the key to stopping a new
outbreak of war between these two nations. Can the characters
find a way to deliver it?
