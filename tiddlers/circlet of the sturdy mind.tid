type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This elegant circlet of emerald and silver defends the wearer's mind. While it is worn, the user's mind cannot be read, and they have a large [[advantage]] to defend against magical [[enchantment]]s such as fear, [[charm]], [[sleep]], or any spells that would alter the user's mental state.
