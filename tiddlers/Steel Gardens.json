        "text": "[[Warforged|warforged]] are living things. They can physically evolve over time; a warforged [[juggernaut]] grows heavier armor plating. The Steel Gardens of [[Eston]] were one of the first breakthroughs in the long process of creating living [[construct]]s. Imagine trees with steel bark and silver leaves covering the same leathery tendrils that form the muscles of the [[warforged]]. [[Starrin d'Cannith]] had high expectations for the Steel Gardens and hoped that one day [[adamantine]] and other ores could be extracted and refined using the strange constructs.\n\nReports from [[Ikar's Salvage]] crew indicate that the garden has grown wild and spread across the ruins. Webs of metallic vines block passages to the mines and enshroud the remains of buildings. One [[Cannith]] sage has theorized that the roots of the garden might have reached one of [[Eston]]â€™s three [[creation forge]]s, and that the garden is a single sentient entity fueled by the mystic power of the forge.",
