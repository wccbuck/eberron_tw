The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends (up to 1 minute later), your weapon pierces both body and mind, and the attack deals extra psychic damage to the target. The target must resist your magic or else suffer [[disadvantage]] on all attempts, especially those requiring quick reaction time, for the next 10 or so seconds.
