Ogres are hulking giants notorious for their quick tempers. The average adult specimen stands between 8 and 10 feet tall and weighs between 600 and 1000 pounds. Most ogres are as lazy of mind as they are strong of body. Most ogres in [[Khorvaire]] dwell in [[Droaam]], but they can increasingly be found in the western cities of the [[Five Nations]] as laborers and mercenaries due to the operations of the [[Liondrake's Roar]] of House [[Tharashk]].

[[Cyclopes|cyclops]] are a rare variety of ogre. [[Oni|oni]] (sometimes called "ogre mages") are distantly related to ogres.

!! Ogres in Droaam

Physically powerful but somewhat dimwitted, most ogres pursue simple pleasures: food, drink, and crushing small creatures that annoy them. The warlords of [[Droaam]] charm them with [[harpy]] song and fill them with [[grist]], then set
them to work lifting heavy things and smashing things that need
to be smashed. They're often recruited in local “brute squads”
and serve as basic shock troopers in the armies of Droaam.

Common ogres are known as "ghaal'gaa," or "mighty children," among the people of [[Droaam]]. They tend to be impulsive and enthusiastic, prone to extreme emotions and short attention spans. Ogres are easily swayed by strong personalities and compelling stories; they love fables and songs (as long as they're simple). It's not uncommon for an ogre to develop a deep attachment to its favorite [[harpy]] or [[changeling]] storyteller. 

In [[Droaamish culture|Culture of Droaam]], the role of "chib" (or chieftain) of a small community has historically been claimed by the biggest and mightiest creature, which means ogre chibs are quite common. An ogre chib might live with a few family members, but when their family gets too big, young ogres split off to form their own villages or work for another chib. While some ogres might aggressively and cruelly impose their will on their subjects, others love their communities and treat the "little folk" like extended family. A benevolent ogre chib might lead a hunt against a dangerous beast, and then hold a feast for their community with storytelling and group song.

The skullcrusher ogres of [[Maenya's Fist]] ([[creature tier]] ''3'') are a different subspecies from common ogres. They are devoted to their duties and don't socialize with other creatures. They are shrewd and proficient, and typically wear plate armor and wield sophisticated weapons. Skullcrushers are well trained and act with military discipline.

!! Ogres of Sarlona

[[Sarlona]] might be known as the cradle of [[human]]ity, but it is also the birthplace of the ogre race. The ogres of [[Khorvaire]] are the descendants of settlers who crossed the [[Barren Sea]] long ago, though this knowledge lives on only in the tales of [[oni]]. Once, the ogres of [[Borunan]] were a proud warrior culture, and their [[oni]] were mighty creatures spoken of in song and story. Their [[cyclopes|cyclops]] were celebrated for their physical might and their ability to see into the [[plane]]s of [[Shavarath]] and [[Fernia]]. Had the ogres ever sought to conquer humanity, the history of
Sarlona might have been quite different. But the ogres
considered humans unworthy foes. This overconfidence
was their undoing, and in the last days of the [[Sundering]],
the [[Inspired]] unified the human kingdoms against this
army of monsters.

Today the ogres are a subdued populace. Most are
not allowed to even touch weapons; they are miners and
laborers, and their immense strength is used to haul
stone and metal for the [[hanbalani alta]]s. Not the brightest of
creatures, most ogres have accepted the philosophy of the
Inspired, and they live lives of happy slavery, dreaming
of attaining humanity in the next life. 

The majority of the ogres on Sarlona
are concentrated in the province of [[Borunan]] in Riedra.
However, ogres can be found throughout Riedra, serving
as laborers and occasionally as soldiers. A few ogres can
be found in [[Syrkarn]], but they are rarely seen in [[Adar]] or
the [[Tashana Tundra]]. 

Beyond [[Riedra]], most of the ogres of Sarlona are
simple folk, more interested in solitude and survival than
in war. However, there is a movement within Riedra that
seeks to rekindle the martial spirit of old. This force is
known as the [[Horned Shadow]].
