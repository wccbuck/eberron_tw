Adventurers and mercenaries in [[Stormreach]] need weapons, and this
store, the preeminent weapon shop in [[Forgelight]], provides
them. Dragon Tooth Arms spends a great deal of coin to
ensure that it has a near monopoly on the more powerful
magic weapons bought and sold in the city. Enchanted weapons here are powerful, but more expensive than they might be in other cities. With the right connections, adventurers can purchase even finer piecesâ€”but still at a markup.
