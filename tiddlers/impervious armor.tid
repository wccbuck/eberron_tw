This set of armor is especially hardy. The extra special [[harm]] box you gain from wearing this [[armor]] can absorb a single 2-harm hit. (Note that this is not the same as gaining two extra special harm boxes.) In addition, it is resistant to direct attacks, such as a [[rust monster]]'s special ability.
