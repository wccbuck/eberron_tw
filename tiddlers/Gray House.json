        "text": "This manor is one of the oldest in the district, and it has a few unusual features; most notably, it has no windows. The outlines of windows have been engraved into the outer walls, but the walls are solid; apparently the architect considered it to be some sort of artistic statement. The Gray House has passed through the hands of a number of [[Karrnath]]i nobles over the last three centuries. While the people of [[Ocean View]] generally distrust foreigners, the inhabitants of the Gray House are invariably charming and\ncharismatic—and [[vampire]]s. The Gray House has long\nbeen used as a safe house for [[undead]] associated with\nthe Order of the [[Emerald Claw]]. The current lady of\nthe house is [[Jesel Tarra'az]]. She spends most of her time\ntending to her “family investments,” but occasionally\nappears at evening galas or other after-dark events. ",
