Lord [[Jonas Wylkes]]’s mother, Tulea Wylkes, is horrified by
what has become of her [[family|Wylkes family]], but she cannot bring
herself to turn on her son. And the next suitable heir
is a boy of sixteen. Tulea might ask adventurers to
help straighten out her son. She could manipulate
the characters into a conflict with House [[Lyrandar]]
or the [[Aurum]], drawing their attention elsewhere. Or
she might ask them to help arrange an “accident” for
Lord Jonas.
