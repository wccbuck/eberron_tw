!! Things to Do in Menthis Plateau

Any list of attractions that tries to summarize what
Menthis Plateau has to offer, even without considering
all the performance events, is doomed to be incomplete.
Of the countless possibilities, some of the most popular
reasons to come here are the following:

* ''Consult a sage.'' [[Morgrave University]] might not be the finest institute of learning in [[Khorvaire]], but it's the best Sharn has to offer. Whether you want to conduct your own research in the library or find a specialist in [[goblinoid]] history, Morgrave likely has what you need.
* ''Go into show business.'' Menthis has a wide range of performance venues, from the [[Grand Stage]] to the many taverns of [[Lower Menthis]]. In addition to enjoying the entertainment, you could try to find workâ€”either showcasing your artistic talents on stage or displaying another sort of prowess in the [[Burning Ring]].
* ''Join an expedition.'' Scholars at Morgrave often sponsor expeditions to [[Xen'drik]] and into the ruins below Sharn. Cyran nobles in [[Smoky Towers]] sometimes hire brave souls to venture into the [[Mournland]] to reclaim lost treasures.
* ''See other cultures.'' [[Den'iyas]] brings a touch of [[Zilargo]] to Sharn. You might find a [[clawfoot]] raptor running down the streets in [[Little Plains]], or a [[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]] [[druid]] casting bones on [[Cassan Bridge]].
