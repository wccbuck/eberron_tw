title: Mizano Rupa's
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Mizano Rupa's is one of three
important dinner theater venues in [[Smoky Towers]]
that give rising stars a stop on their ascent between
[[Gailan's]] and [[Upper Menthis]]. Self-consciously named
and styled in imitation of Gailan's in the [[Torchfire]]
district below, Rupa's offers decent food and high-quality entertainment in a variety of styles. Mizano Rupa ([[dwarf]]) is hardly a connoisseur
of fine music, but he knows what he likes and—fortunately—his tastes seem to compare with those of many
in [[Middle Menthis]], making his establishment quite
popular. Reservations are recommended.
