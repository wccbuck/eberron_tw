        "text": "//Period: 80,000–40,000 years ago//\n\nDuring the Age of Giants, scholars describe how...\n\n* [[Giant|giant]] nations in [[Xen'drik]] unlocked secrets of arcane magic still unmatched in the modern age.\n* The giants fought the inhabitants of [[Dal Quor]], ending the conflict by destroying a [[moon]] and thereby breaking Dal Quor's link to [[Eberron]].\n* The giants threatened to crush an [[elvish|elf]] rebellion with dangerous epic magics, prompting the [[dragon]]s to step in, utterly destroying Xen'drik and cursing the land.\n\nIn the wake of the [[Age of Demons]], the [[dragon]]s were the most\npowerful force in [[Eberron]]. Some dragons helped guide lesser\ncreatures, including the [[giant]]s of [[Xen'drik]], in their mastery of\n[[arcane magic]]. As the dragons' increasing dominion caused a\nsurge in the [[Daughter of Khyber|Tiamat]]'s power, the dragons were forced to withdraw to isolation in [[Argonnessen]]. They remain there to this day, in hopes of preventing her\npower from increasing further.\n\nMultiple nations of [[giant]]s arose on [[Xen'drik]]: the [[Sulat League]], the [[Group of Eleven]], the [[Cul'sir Dominion|Cul'sir]]. It's not known\nwhether the Cul'sir attacked [[Dal Quor]] or whether the [[quori]] of\nthe time sought to invade Eberron, but the two powers fought\nan extended war. The giants ended the conflict by destroying\none of the [[moon]]s of Eberron with [[cataclysmic magic|Moon Breaker]],\ndamaging the planar connection between Dal Quor and the\nworld. Since then, the quori have been unable to physically\ntravel to Eberron, and there are no longer any [[manifest zone]]s\nto Dal Quor.\n\nThese actions had devastating repercussions for [[giant]]\ncivilization. In the upheaval, many [[Cul'sir]] subjects used the\nopportunity to rebel, but the largest uprising was that of the\n[[elves|elf]]—both those oppressed by the Cul'sir, and warrior elves\nwho had never been conquered by the giants. When the\nCul'sir threatened to draw on their most dangerous magics\nonce more to destroy the elves, the [[dragon]]s emerged in force\nfrom [[Argonnessen]]. They utterly devastated the civilizations\nof [[Xen'drik]], giant and otherwise, then laid curses on the land\nthat are beyond the comprehension of the modern age. To this\nday, the scourge of the land prevents any advanced civilization\nfrom rising again. The [[Traveler's Curse]] warps space and\nmakes travel in Xen'drik unreliable. The curse known as the\n[[Du'rashka Tul]]—“the madness of crowds”—causes civilizations\nthat become too advanced or widespread to collapse into\nmadness. Draconic curses are believed the reason the giants\n[[devolved|Curse of the Titans]] from mighty titans into [[hill giant]]s and the other\ngiants known today. The full extent of these draconic curses is\nunknown, but the impact is unmistakable.\n\nTheir grim mission accomplished, the [[dragon]]s returned to [[Argonnessen]] to brood. All agreed that the people of Xen'drik\nwould never have posed such a threat if the dragons had\nnot shared the secrets of magic. The [[Conclave]] called\nthe event //kurash [[Ourelonastrix]]//—Aureon’s Folly—and forbade\nany flight henceforth from sharing the secrets of Argonnessen with\nlesser beings.\n\n!!

Abbreviated Timeline\n\n| !Year|!Event |\n| -80,000|The [[titan|giant]]s rise from the ruins of the [[Dragon|dragon]]-[[Fiend|fiend]] wars to establish a vast and powerful civilization on the continent of [[Xen'drik]]. They enslave [[elves|elf]] and other [[humanoid]] races. |\n| -60,000|[[Dragon|dragon]]s make contact with the giant kingdoms and begin to teach them [[arcane magic]]. The [[elves|elf]] watch and learn from their place at the [[giant]]s' heels. The giants master the arcane arts, creating wonders unequaled even in the modern day. |\n| -40,000|The [[quori]] invade [[Xen'drik]] through a gate that connects [[Eberron]] to [[Dal Quor]], the [[plane]] of dreams. After years of battle, the [[giant]]s create the [[Moon Breaker]] and use it to destroy the planar gate. This act results in a cataclysm that shakes Xen'drik to its core and plunges large chunks of the continent beneath the sea. The physical connection to [[Dal Quor]] is severed, perhaps forever. |\n| -39,000|The remaining [[giant]] kingdoms never quite recover from the events of the [[quori]] invasion. Curses and plagues sweep through the land, and the [[elves|elf]] use the opportunity to rebel. The [[Sulat League]] [[magebreeds|magebreeding]] the first [[drow]] to put down the rebellion. In desperation, the giants again turn to the same magic they used to stop the quori. Before they can unleash such destruction a second time, the [[dragon]]s attack. Giant civilization crumbles, the [[drow]] go into hiding, and the elves flee to [[Aerenal]]. |\n\n!! Why Does It Matter?\n\nThe curses laid on [[Xen'drik]] mean that the entire continent is in\nessence a vast dungeon, a land that can never be fully mapped\nor explored. The [[giant]]s mastered secrets of arcane magic as\nyet unmatched by [[human]]ity or even by the [[elves|elf]], and as such\nXen'drik is a source for powerful artifacts, [[spell]]s, and [[eldritch machine]]s. Elemental [[airship]]s and the development of the [[warforged]] were both inspired by discoveries tied to the ancient giants, and a new find could be just as important. A race to\nrecover a [[Cul'sir]] artifact could easily drive an adventure, and\n[[Sulat|Sulat League]] weapons could shift the balance of power in [[Khorvaire]]\nif they fell into the wrong hands.\n\nWhile Xen'drik's many curses make it nearly impossible to\ncolonize the land, that doesn't stop people from trying! The\ncity of [[Stormreach]] is an outpost on the edge of the unknown,\na gateway through which powerful artifacts, unknown magics,\nand exotic creatures flow into Khorvaire. Beyond Stormreach\nlies an intriguing continent of ruins and wonders, waiting to\nbe explored.\n\n!! Character Ideas\n\nThough the Age of Giants has faded into legend, consider these\nideas how your character might encounter its echoes today:\n\n* As an [[elf]], you're haunted by trance-visions of an ancient city of your distant ancestors hidden somewhere in trackless [[Xen'drik]]. What is the force that's calling you there?\n* As an [[artificer]], you're on the edge of an arcane breakthrough, but the final piece of the puzzle is tied to the work of the [[giant]]s. You'll need to search through their ruins for clues.\n* You possess a trinket from [[Xen'drik]]—a prospector's map? an ancient key?—tied to an ancient [[Sulat|Sulat League]] vault.\n* You own a deed to a small stretch of land outside of [[Stormreach]]. Will you try to develop it?",
