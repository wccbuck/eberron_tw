Maezan Shal, also known as the Thunderhand, was a great [[druid]] of the [[Tairnadal]]. During the [[Valaes Tairn]] occupation of southern [[Khorvaire]] during the [[Age of Monsters]] (in the region now known as [[Valenar]]), Maezan raised the monolithic [[Border Keeps of Valenar]] from the earth; most of them still stand to this day. He also raised the [[bronzewood]] thicket that protects [[Taer Valaestas]].

Maezan was a [[revenant|Spirits of the Past]] of the legendary druid Shal, who was inspired by [[Vaela the Wolf|Vaela]].
