        "text": "The homes of [[Io'lokar]] are universally stocked with [[magic item]]s that produce\nhearty food and drink, and the chefs and tavernkeepers of the city take such magic beyond the sublime. Nonetheless, the [[Io'lokari]] are as passionate about gastronomy as they are all other arts, and city folk supplement their magical fare with the bounty of the gardens. High-level [[druid]]s use their spellpower to augment permanent magical effects that produce a full harvest each and every day. Produce is available at the [[public markets|Public Markets of Io'lokar]] from dawn to dusk.\n\n[[Druid|druid]]s are rarer within the city than other spellcasters, and druid characters can easily find a place in the ranks of the city’s gardeners. However, the magic\nthat forces an entire season’s growing into a single day involves powerful [[planar|plane]] magic tapping into the power of [[Lamannia]], the Twilight Forest. Planar disturbances that open up rifts to [[Lamannia]] are a constant risk to the city.",
