        "text": "The Celestial Vista\nis the most well known of [[Skyway]]'s elegant restaurants, and the most in demand. The maitre d'hotel\ncheerfully turns away visitors who have no reservations, and even those with reservations can be forced\nto wait an hour or more to be seated. The menu is the epitome of [[Sharn fusion|Culture of Breland]], but offers some less exotic fare as well to accommodate throngs of\nnot-very-adventurous tourists who come for the view\nrather than the food. The owner of the Celestial\nVista is [[Evix ir'Marasha]], who is also Skyway's representative on the\n[[City Council|Sharn Council]]. ",
