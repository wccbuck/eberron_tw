At its greatest, the empire encompassed a region covering all of modern-day [[Q'barra]], most of the [[Talenta Plains]], and a large portion of [[Valenar]].\n\n!! Links to Headers\n* <<scrollToHeader \"Overview\">>\n* <<scrollToHeader \"The Legacy of Arkhosia\">>\n* <<scrollToHeader \"Notes\">>\n\n!! Overview \n\nThe origin and downfall of Arkhosia both lie in the sacred mission to guard the prison of the [[overlord]] [[Masvirik]], the Cold Sun, and fight against his influence. Many millennia ago, likely early in the [[Age of Monsters]], the [[dragon]]s of [[Argonnessen]] sent the [[black dragon]] [[Rhashaak]] and a host of elite [[dragonborn]] soldiers of the [[Light of Siberys]] to watch over [[Q'barra]]. Rhashaak and his greatest warriors stationed themselves at Masvirik's prison itself, the demonic volcano citadel of [[Haka'torvhak]]; but most of the [[dragonborn]] spread throughout the jungle region, establishing garrisons at [[sites of fiendish influence|dragonborn clanhold]]. They served for thousands of years as watchful sentinels against any sign of the return of the Cold Sun.\n\nBut no sign came. [[Masvirik]] remained quiet. The now-flourishing [[dragonborn]] population of [[Q'barra]], raised to prepare for battle which might never come, grew restless. The elders asserted that [[Rhashaak]] at [[Haka'torvhak]] held the great fiend at bay, fighting a spiritual battle every day against the Cold Sun, but the dragonborn as a whole reached the point where they could not make sense of their place in that battle.\n\nAnd so, the hundredth peacetime generation of a warrior culture crossed the [[Endworld Mountains]] in legions and found their war. Conquering early societies of [[halfling]]s, [[orc]]s, and [[lizardfolk]], the [[dragonborn]] of Arkhosia carved out their kingdom across the [[Blade Desert]] (which was considerably smaller in those days) and the plains beyond.\n\nIt didn't take long for news of the new nation to reach the ears of emperor of [[Dhakaan]]. The massive [[goblinoid]] empire was nearing its golden age, and had spread across most of the modern-day [[Five Nations]] region. While [[Dhakaan]] had no interest in colonizing the [[Blade Desert]] and beyond, they suffered no challenge to their supremacy on [[Khorvaire]], and met the [[dragonborn]] in battle. And the Arkhosians, hungry for worthy opponents, met their match in the Dhakaani.\n\nOver the next two centuries (circa 5900 to 5700 years ago), the [[dragonborn]] and [[goblinoid]]s clashed in wars that ebbed and flowed. During this period, Arkhosia built at least two great cities: ''Io'vanthor'' nestled in [[Endworld Mountains]], and ''Krenstak'' located in the heart of the [[Talenta Plains]]. At its greatest, Arkhosia's reach extended all the way to the shores of [[Lake Cyre]], establishing the remote enclave of ''Rolaz-Gaar''. The arcane architects of Arkhosia also created great wonders of engineering, such ''Ustraternes'', the \"fortress of flying stone,\" a massive mobile flying citadel that could deploy [[dragonborn]] paratroopers into battle from above.\n\nThis was a glorious time for the [[dragonborn]] of Arkhosia, who successfully held back the great armies of [[Dhakaan]] for over two hundred years. But the battle the dragonborn had been sent to fight finally came back to haunt them. In [[Haka'torvhak]], [[Masvirik]] stirred, overwhelming the guardian dragon [[Rhashaak]] and spreading his influence across the land. He infected the minds of reptilian folk of all kinds in [[Q'barra]] and beyond, creating the [[Poison Dusk]]. Swarms of frenzied [[kobold]]s and [[lizardfolk]] assailed Arkhosian settlements, and corrupted dragonborn turned on their kin throughout the empire. Krenstak was burned to the ground, and traitorous dragonborn of Io'vanthor flung open their gates for the Poison Dusk invaders. The hovering citadel Ustraternes crashed into the foothills of the [[Endworld Mountains]].\n\nAs the empire of Arkhosia collapsed, the dragonborn withdrew from their western lands, returning to [[Q'barra]] to face the source of this terrible curse. The ensuing struggle nearly destroyed the entire dragonborn culture on [[Khorvaire]], leaving barely a tenth of their number alive. Today, the fight against the [[Poison Dusk]] continues, and the dragonborn population remains a small fraction of what it was at the height of their power.\n\n!! The Legacy of Arkhosia\n\nToday, few ruins of Arkhosia remain. After the fall of the empire, the structures of the [[dragonborn]] that were still standing have not stood the test of time as well as those of the [[Dhakaan]]i. That said, the ruins of Io'vanthor can still be found hidden in the [[Endworld Mountains]]. The magical spring that provided fresh water to the city (which ancient texts refer to as \"the Blood of [[Io]]\") dried up two thousand years ago, but a clan of [[kobold]]s still carves out a living here among the ancient rubble.\n\nAlthough empire of Arkhosia fell over 5600 years ago and lasted only two centuries, its legacy looms large in the cultural consciousness of the [[dragonborn]]. Clans still claim to trace their lineages to leaders or heroes of the empire. Dragonborn still quote the axioms of the warrior-philosopher Khomagar, and tell tales of the great general Surina. Some traditions of the [[Q'barra]] dragonborn appear extend to the days of Arkhosia; for example, the tradition of traveling dragonborn monks who serve as peacekeepers and mediators may originate with the wandering judges and administrators of the empire.\n\nHowever, some among the dragonborn are not content to let the most glorious days of their people lie in the distant past. [[Mishva Garodya|Mishva Garodya Stormhorn]] of the [[Stormhorn Clan|Stormhorn Clanhold]] seeks to reclaim the greatness of Arkhosia and forge a new dragonborn kingdom.",
