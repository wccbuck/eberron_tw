While the [[Grand Stage]] in the\n[[University District]] also performs more recent works\nechoing the classical style, the Classic has a stated\npolicy of not even considering new works. Every performance in the Classic features archaic language, outmoded social customs, and the idealistic outlook\nof a world that has utterly vanished from [[Khorvaire]],\nyet its thousand seats fill up every night.
