Benith Ava Denithki was once an up-and-coming member of House [[Sivis]] working in the [[Notaries Guild]] offices in [[Sharn]]. Though she was gifted at scribing, her true talents seemed to lie in politics, and she navigated the complicated bureaucracy of House [[Sivis]] as deftly as an acrobat on a tightrope.

Although she is a distant cousin of [[Lysse Lyrriman d'Sivis]], no member of Benith's family has ever borne a [[dragonmark]], and that turned out to be an unavoidable obstacle in her career path. She grew frustrated as positions of importance and transfers to the main [[enclave]] in [[Zilargo]] were repeatedly given to lesser scribes who happened to have dragonmarked relatives. Eventually she resigned from the guild and renounced all ties to House [[Sivis]].

Less than a week later, Benith opened ''Denithki and Associates'', a private licensing office that took advantage of her knowledge of [[Sharn]]'s bureaucracy and connections within the [[Notaries Guild]] to help clients secure even the most difficult-to-obtain documents and licenses. The vast majority of the work done by Denithki and Associates is legitimate and completely legal. However, Benith occasionally takes commissions to create falsified documents, using her intimate familiarity with House [[Sivis]]'s practices and materials to make almost perfect forgeries.
