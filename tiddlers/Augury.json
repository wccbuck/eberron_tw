The master of The Augury is a 334-year-old elf named [[Kestia]]. \n\nThe Augury cuts into the profits of a number of the [[dragonmarked house]]s, notably [[Tharashk]], [[Sivis]], and [[Kundarak]]. Some believe that [[Kestia]] uses blackmail\nto protect herself from the retribution of the houses, while others say that she appeases the houses with a share of her profits.",
