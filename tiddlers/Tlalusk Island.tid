type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Tlalusk Island lies in the [[Bitter Sea]], near [[Icewhite Island]]. It is named for its high concentration of [[tlalusk]]s, strange six-legged mammoth-like beasts which roam the island.

Rumors suggest a hidden enclave of the [[Kraken's Brood]], the [[Devourer]]-worshiping cult within House [[Lyrandar]], can be found somewhere on the coast of Tlalusk Island.
