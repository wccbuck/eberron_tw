        "text": "Clan Orgaal is a branch of the ambitious ruling\nClan [[Velderan]] of House [[Tharashk]]. These clans seek to increase [[Tharashk]]’s influence across [[Khorvaire]] and to ensure Velderan’s ultimate dominance within the house. Velderan has no interest in the [[Gatekeepers]] or the [[Cults of the Dragon Below]],\nand the clan exploits their squabbles to weaken its\nrivals. The ruling clans pay little attention to the small,\n[[orc]]-dominated Orgaal, which allows the [[Veldokaa]] to use it for covert activities. Orgaal could employ adventurers to sow discord among other clans or embark on missions that aid Velderan at the expense of its rivals.\n\nClan Orgaal has a camp north of [[Zarash'ak]], and they bring goods into the city on the wings of [[wyvern]]s.",
