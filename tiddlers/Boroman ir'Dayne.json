        "text": "In his youth, Lord Boroman ir'Dayne was a great hunter and explorer. He led the only known expedition ever to cross the treacherous [[White Sea]] north of [[Sarlona]], reach the [[Frostfell]], and return to tell the tale; today, [[Dayne Bay]] bears his name. He wrestled [[ogre]]s in [[Droaam]], fought [[chuul]]s in the [[Shadow Marches]], discovered [[myconid]]s in [[Khyber]], and was the first [[halfling]] to travel south of the [[Titan's Teeth]] in [[Xen'drik]] and return. \n\nDayne amassed a fortune in his day, but during his final expedition to Xen'drik he contracted a slow, wasting curse that no magic has been able to reverse.\nHe has a few years of life left, and while he no longer\nhas the strength to explore on his own, he still wants\nto unlock the mysteries of the unknown.  To this end,\nhe dedicated his fortune to establishing the [[Wayfinder Foundation]]—a guild for adventurers and explorers that funds dangerous expeditions to exotic locales, as well as\ngiving bold adventurers a place to display their trophies and tell tall tales. \n\nBoroman has the final say on all expenditures of foundation funds, even overriding decisions of the Wayfinder Conclave. Despite his skills, Dayne has been crippled\nby the wasting curse and rarely leaves the foundation's [[Headquarters|Wayfinder Foundation Headquarters]] in [[Fairhaven]].\n\nBoroman ir’Dayne is a true philanthropist; he wishes\nto have his name attached to the great adventures of the\nfuture, since he himself can no longer participate in\nthe adventures of the present. His one ulterior motive\nis the hope that an explorer may discover a cure for the\nstrange wasting curse that is slowly sapping his life.",
