type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A gray ooze is stone transmuted to semi-sapient liquid. When it moves, it slithers like a liquid snake, rising to strike. The ooze is very corrosive, particularly to metal; an ooze can eat through an inch of nonmagical metal in as few as three seconds.

Some gray oozes spontaneously develop heightened intelligence as well as [[psionic|psionics]] abilities such as telekinesis. It is not yet known what causes this transformation.
