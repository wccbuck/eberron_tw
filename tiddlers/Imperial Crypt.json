        "text": "The Imperial Crypt was the royal necropolis of the pre-[[Sundering]] Empire of [[Nulakaz]], located on a [[wild zone]] to [[Dolurrh]]. The place is curiously infused with resurrection magic. When any form of magic that [[returns life to the dead|raise dead]] is used here, it only requires half the usual costly material components. In some cases the dead interred here have spontaneously returned to life, though perhaps not with the same souls they began with. \n\nClose to [[Dar Mun]], the Imperial Crypt is heavily guarded by the [[Edgewalkers]]. The [[Inspired]] have limited access to [[resurrection]] and largely don't need it, because they simply employ new hosts; but it could be that the Inspired are working on new techniques, trying to transform this zone into a resurrection factory.
