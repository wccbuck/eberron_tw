[[Morrikan|Morrikan d'Kundarak]]’s grandniece Daphanë d’Kundarak is as aggressive a banker as can be found in western Khorvaire. President of the [[Kundarak Bank|Kundarak Bank of Sharn]] in [[Sharn]] (located in the financial district of [[Korranath]]), she maintains a strong voice in public policy by offering or withholding bank loans for major projects. Her blunt style wins her few friends: She is seen as stubborn (by [[parliament|Breland Parliament]]) and as too much of a risk-taker (by many of [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]]’s advisors).
