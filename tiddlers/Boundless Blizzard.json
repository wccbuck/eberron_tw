        "text": "Chill winds howl as snow and hail fill the air. Explorers may\nfind themselves on an icy plateau or in a mountain pass; with\nthe vicious storm, visibility is limited to 60 feet, so there's no\nknowing what lies ahead. Adventurers may find an occasional\ncave or other shelter, but it's always possible that it's already\noccupied by a [[remorhaz]] or other stranded [[monstrosity]]. As\nthis is one of the more dangerous [[layer]]s of [[Risia]], this is a good place\nto search for the frozen bodies of other adventurers, held in\nstasis beneath the ice.\n\nThe raging storm of the Boundless Blizzard never ends,\nand adventurers face high winds and lethal cold. The layer is\npermanently caught between night and day; due to the storm,\nthe light is dim at best, and areas of intense snow may be\nheavily obscured.",
