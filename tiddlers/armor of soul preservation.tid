type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This suit of black plate armor is etched with gold detailing. If the wearer dies, their soul is automatically sealed into the armor where it will remain until the body is [[revived|raise dead]], the soul is transferred to another vessel, or another person dies in the armor. Resurrecting someone wearing this armor is a much easier and safer affair than attempting to pull a soul back from [[Dolurrh]].
