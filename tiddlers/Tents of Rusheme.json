Amid the\ntents, nomadic tribes of [[giant]]s (together known as the [[Guardians of Rushemé]]) come together to trade with one another and the people of Stormreach, to be\nclose to their ancestral city, to perform their rites, and to hire on as guides into the continent’s interior. [[Gaulronak]] is the oldest and most respected [[giant]] residing in the encampment.\n\nAlthough [[Hular]] and the other [[eneko]] at [[Black Iron]] have some of the closest relationships with the [[giant]]s, others have managed to forge relationships\nwith them. The giants make the rules among the tents,\nbut the [[Stormreach Guard]] keeps a close watch on them;\nRushemé is largely peaceful, but the physical might of the\ngiants is enough to make the [[Storm Lords]] nervous.",
