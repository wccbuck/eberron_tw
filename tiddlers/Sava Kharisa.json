        "text": "Sava Kharisa ([[human]] councilor for [[Lower Central]]), one of the most outspoken members of the council, espouses a wide range of radical philosophies and political views. She honestly does the best she can to help all of the people of [[Sharn]],\ninstead of trying to advance her political career or protect her personal supporters. This has earned her many enemies on the [[Council|Sharn Council]], and if she's not careful the [[Boromar Clan]] could try to have her removed from officeâ€”permanently. Due to her radical views, connections, and desire to fight corruption, Sava makes an excellent choice as a patron for adventurers. ",
