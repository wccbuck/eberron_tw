An ioun stone is a small magical crystal that orbits the bearer's head, granting magical powers. Invented by the [[wizard]] Congenio Ioun during the early days of the Kingdom of [[Galifar]], the earliest "Ioun's stones" stored [[spell]]s or slightly enhanced the bearer's intellect or fortitude. Modern ioun stones can provide any number of magical effects, including regeneration or even the absorption of hostile spells.
