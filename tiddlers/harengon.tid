Harengons are hare-like, bipedal humanoids who seem to have originated from a sprawling burrow-hall they call [[Holondon Holt]] in western [[Droaam]]. They have the characteristic long feet of the rabbits they resemble and fur in a variety of colors. They share the keen senses and powerful legs of leporine creatures and are full of energy, like a wound-up spring. Harengons range from 3 to 5 feet in height (not counting their long ears).

For information surrounding the character and origins of the Holondon harengon, see [[Holondon Holt]].
