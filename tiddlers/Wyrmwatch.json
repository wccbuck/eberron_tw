        "text": "A thriving prospecting town and the largest settlement in [[Hope]], Wyrmwatch was\nestablished by [[Cyran|Cyre]] refugees only three years ago. Although far smaller\nthan [[New Cyre]] in [[Breland]], its people are proud of what\nthey have built. \n\nWalled in stone on the rocky hills above a fertile plain, the settlement has endured\nattack from [[Valenar]] [[elves|elf]], [[kobold]]s, and hostile [[dragonborn]], even as it continues to grow on the strength of local mining and agriculture. Wyrmwatch is populated by settlers who prefer the frontier life to the ideals of [[New Galifar]], as well as by folk displaced by the destruction of smaller settlements.\n\nWyrmwatch is a theocracy—a bastion of radical [[Silver Flame]] practitioners within [[Q'barra]]. The town’s leader is Elder Wedon Nevillom, a zealot and\nveteran of the [[Last War]]. Nevillom's courage and passionate sermons help sustain the people of Wyrmwatch in difficult times. He and his followers hold to a somewhat puritanical and xenophobic interpretation of the Church's values. As such, no [[lizardfolk]] are allowed in Wyrmwatch, and [[dragonborn]] are treated with suspicion.",
