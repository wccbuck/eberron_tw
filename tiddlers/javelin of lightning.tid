type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you is electrocuted. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target.
