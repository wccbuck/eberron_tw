The inanimate gargoyles that perch atop great buildings are inspired by these malevolent creatures of elemental earth that resemble grotesque, fiendish statues. 

Gargoyles are likely native to [[Eberron]], though some scholars hypothesize they are creations of the [[daelkyr]] [[Orlassk]]. They can be found throughout [[Khorvaire]] (but especially [[Droaam]]), as well as [[Xen'drik]].

!! Gargoyles in Droaam

Since the rise of the [[Daughters|Daughters of Sora Kell]], gargoyles have
been deployed across [[Droaam]]; they are also favorite recruits
of House [[Tharashk]]. Civilian gargoyles serve as messengers
and couriers, while most warlords also have a unit of combat-ready gargoyles that serve as scouts and rapid response. As
[[elemental]]s, gargoyles don't eat, sleep, or drink, and they can
remain motionless for months or years. While gargoyles have
traditionally been depicted as cruel predators, the fact is that
they love the //thrill// of hunting. They yearn for challenge, and
love riddles and puzzles almost as much as hunting prey.
