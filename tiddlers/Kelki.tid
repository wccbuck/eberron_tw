Kelki is a reliable [[Summit Road]] guide, and
[[Murephan]] has taken a liking to the young and vivacious
[[dromite]]. When traveling with Murephan and those being
aided by the Summit Road, Kelki spends a lot of time
explaining what Murephan really meant with his harsh
words. In these "translations," Kelki is usually correct.
Fortunately for everyone involved, Kelki defers to the
elan's judgment in important matters. Kelki has nothing
resembling common sense, and the dromite is too fond
of fire.
