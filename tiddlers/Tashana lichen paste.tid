title: Tashana lichen paste
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Tashana|Tashana Tundra]] shamans can create a wide variety of magic substances from the native rock lichens that approximate the effects of standard
[[potion]]s and oils. The lichen pastes use natural materials
and processes such as sun-drying. They can be purchased in the coastal ports of [[Whitetooth]] and [[Winterstead]], or from individual [[shifter]] tribes encountered in the
inland of Tashana.

Consumable pastes appear as very small and thin wafers of
shredded leaves. Oil-type pastes have a greasy or buttery consistency. Taste and smell also vary among types.

The Tashana region also produces some lichens which
contain natural magical or psychoactive properties. These
lichens do not require any preparation and can be harvested and ingested raw. The most notorious of these is
the blood-red rock lichen known as [[icewild]].
