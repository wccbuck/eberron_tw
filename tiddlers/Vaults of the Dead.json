Its fortified facilities include workshops for the production of [[undead]], warehouses for storing bones and bodies, and the vast catacombs that currently hold the vast majority of [[Karrnathi undead]] that have been sealed below since the [[Treaty of Thronehold]] was signed. \n\nThe Night Forge can also be found within the Vaults of the Dead, which produces the distinctive armor of the [[Karrnathi undead]], which is fitted to their fleshless bones.\n\nThe Vaults of the Dead are maintained by the [[Ministry of the Dead]], a government agency that is not connected to the [[Blood of Vol]] faith or the [[Crimson Monastery]].",
