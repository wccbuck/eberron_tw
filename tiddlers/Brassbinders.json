        "text": "The Brassbinders are a faction of the [[Sulatu]] who work most closely with the [[efreet|efreeti]] of [[Fernia]]. Among this school of thought, the [[Ju'qatan|Grand Ju'qata]] sense of spectacle is especially present, as Brassbinder philosophy is centered around the power of passion, celebration, and splendor. There's no point in trying to transform the world if you're not enjoying yourself while doing it!\n\nBrassbinder-led communities hold celebrations or other social events almost every day of the year. While upper-crust Brassbinders may be prone to developing cults of destructive desire, most Brassbinders are sincere in their desire to share comfort, art, and ecstatic faith with those around them.",
