        "text": "Captain Malik Otherro leads the [[Crown Knights]] of [[Thrane]]. When he joined the order over four decades ago, he took an oath to defend the royal family and the citizens of his country. Only a few years later, as [[Shadukar]] burned at the hands of [[Karrnathi|Karrnath]] troops, Otherro rode with a large force of knights into the ruins to locate survivors. When Thrane's populace vilified [[Diani ir'Wynarn]] for failing to prevent the catastrophe, Otherro stood by her side and vocally defended her. Since that time, court insiders have suspected that the handsome [[paladin]]'s unswerving loyalty to the blood regent hides some behind-the-scenes romanceâ€”especially as Otherro rose through the ranks of the [[Crown Knights]].\n\nCaptain Otherro often confers with Queen [[Diani|Diani ir'Wynarn]] about political maneuverings, military threats, and the fate of the nation. Despite the growing Throneholder movement that seeks to overthrow the [[Silver Flame]] theocracy and set Diani in a position of sovereignty over [[Thrane]], the Captain serves the [[Council of Cardinals]] faithfully. Otherro believes that both the Church of the [[Silver Flame]] and the [[Wynarn|Wynarn family]] crown have their place in the kingdom, and it was a mistake to upset the balance between the two. Fate may invariably compel Otherro to choose Diani over his duty, but only time will tell.\n\nCaptain Otherro's mount is a [[magebred|magebreeding]] heavy warhorse named Thaedrar ([[Aerenese]] for \"summer wind\").",
