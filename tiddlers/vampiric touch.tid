For up to one minute, your hand is wreathed in shadows, and your touch can siphon life force from living creatures to heal your wounds. When you touch a living creature with this hand while the spell is active, the creature suffers [[necrotic damage|damage type]], and you benefit from moderate-[[impact]] [[magical healing]]. Each subsequent time you touch a creature with this hand before the spell ends, your healing is only low-impact.
