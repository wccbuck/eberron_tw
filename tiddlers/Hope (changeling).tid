type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Hope is Lord [[Katanavash]]'s personal assistant and bodyguard. She has served the [[Thousand Eyes]] of [[Riedra]] all her life, and she is fanatically devoted to her master.
She is a brilliant negotiator and often assumes Lord Katanavash’s identity to deal with engagements he wishes to avoid. Only a dozen other people serve at the [[Riedran consulate|Riedran Consulate (Stormreach)]] in [[Stormreach]]—four guards, six servants, and two administrative assistants—and all of them are aware of this practice. They believe that Hope has been blessed by the consul and that in her next life she will be one of the [[Chosen]] hosts.
