        "text": "House [[Vadalis]] has deep roots in the region surrounding [[Sylbaran]]. Many local families have connections to the house that date back centuries, and Vadalis provides vital services for travelers. While there are [[druid]]s who despise Vadalis, the [[Wardens of the Wood]] allow the house to operate as long as it adheres to certain guidelines on the treatment of its [[beast]]s and restrictions on [[magebreeding]]. \n\nThe Stampede is a [[Vadalis]] [[enclave]] that focuses on providing mounts and teams for [[Orien]] caravans and couriers, as well as caring for the animal companions of other travelers. The Stampede breeds [[tribex]], but only as mounts and beast of burden; this is a trivial operation when compared to the stockyards of [[Shavalant]]. The Stampede is run by [[Myrana d'Vadalis]], a tough old woman whose greatest pride is the pair of [[bulette]]s who live on the ranch, which she calls Trundle and Grim. Myrana has been working with these two for years and has established a strong bond with them, but so far the bulettes have never produced young. Myrana will often bring Trundle to local festivals, and allow children to ride the [[monstrosity]].",
