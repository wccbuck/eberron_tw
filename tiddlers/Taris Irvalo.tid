Taris Irvalo is one of the few
people in [[Embers]] who has a true connection to the
[[Silver Flame]], but she chooses to work with the [[Knights of Thrane]]
instead of at the [[Keep of the Silver Flame]]. She is a
gentle woman, and she tries to prevent [[Valen Vanatar]] from
engaging in rash action.
