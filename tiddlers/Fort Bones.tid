Fort Bones lies far from the heart of [[Karrnath]]. No
[[lightning rail]] leads to this bleak citadel, and roads
shattered by war have yet to be repaired. The bones
of fallen enemies are fused to its walls, and skeletal
warriors keep silent vigil on the ramparts. As a show
of good faith and dedication to peace, Kaius III withdrew most of Karrnath's [[undead]] legions and sealed
them in the vaults below the city of [[Atur]]. Only a few
elite units remain in the service of the crown, scattered across the nation. Fort Bones is one of the only places where the dead outnumber the living. Here [[bone knight]]s lead fleshless cavalry
against [[Valenar]] raiders, while the [[Corpse Collectors]]
pioneer new forms of [[necromancy]] in preparation for
wars to come.

!! During the Last War

The citadel now known as Fort Bones was once
the seat of Gyrnar Shult, a priest of the [[Blood of Vol]]
and the reeve of the agricultural region of Odakyr. The [[Cyran|Cyre]] warlord Kaina ir'Durna claimed Gyrnar's keep
at the start of the [[Last War]]. The warlord
dismissed Gyrnar's warnings about the power of
the [[Mabar]] [[manifest zone]] surrounding the keep and the importance of his rites. Then, when Mabar entered a coterminous phase, its
dark power flowed out of the keep and leached the
life from the land. Across Odakyr, crops failed and
livestock withered. This event was just one among
those that led to the first crippling famine, but it was
one that could have been prevented.

When [[Kaius I|Kaius ir'Wynarn I]] embraced the aid of the [[Blood of Vol]], Gyrnar returned as commander of the newly fortified keep. He rechristened it Fort Bones, swearing that the bones of every Karrn that had fallen
would serve as a wall to protect those still alive. It
would be decades before actual bones would be
incorporated into the walls, but Gyrnar devoted
himself to improving the military applications of
[[necromancy]]. It was during this time that Gyrnar and the high priest [[Malevanor]]—then a living person—developed and perfected the [[Odakyr Rites]],
the ritual that produces the infamous [[Karrnathi undead]]. While [[Atur]] became the primary seat for
the production of undead, the power of the [[Mabar]]
[[manifest zone]] ensured that Fort Bones remained a
vital center for the development of undead and the
training of [[bone knight]]s.

Fort Bones weathered many sieges without falling, and no one expected the outright devastation that accompanied the Long Night in 990 YK. The finest [[druid]]s and [[wizard]]s of the [[Valenar]] joined together for the attack, shattering the fort's walls with earthquakes and storms. By the time relief arrived from [[Fort Zombie]], the fortress had been obliterated. The
new commander swore to rebuild the walls with the
bones of her enemies, and this was no idle threat.
Bones of humans and elves are embedded into the
pale stone and mortar of the restored fortress, and
they moan softly when enemies approach.

!! Fort Bones Today

Even within [[Karrnath]], many people despise the role
that the [[undead]] played in the war. [[Kaius I|Kaius ir'Wynarn I]] was forced
to use undead soldiers out of desperation, but many
of the warlords believe that his decision was a stain
on Karrnath's proud martial history—that [[Rekkenmark|Rekkenmark Academy]]'s finest could have found a way to overcome
the odds. Beyond this, heavy reliance on undead greatly increased the influence of the [[Blood of Vol]] across Karrnath, something that concerned [[Kaius III|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] and Regent [[Moranna]]. The decision to seal the
legions below [[Atur]] and to cease the mass production
of undead in the City of Night was a vital move to
strengthen Kaius's position both within and beyond
Karrnath's borders. However, Kaius isn't willing to
let this power go. Fort Bones is far from Atur and the
public eye. The fortress serves as a vital watchtower
against [[Valenar]] incursion, but it is also the primary
research facility for the [[Corpse Collectors]], the royal
necromancers of Karrnath.

[[Alinda Dorn]] is the military commander of Fort Bones.
