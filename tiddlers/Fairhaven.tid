''Population:'' <<ntls>>

The capital of [[Aundair]] is one of the most beautiful
cities in [[Eberron]]. Stunning displays of magical light
and other arcane wonders enhance the exquisite architecture. This is the seat of the [[University of Wynarn]], a
prestigious institution that draws students from across Khorvaire. As a noble, entertainer, or sage, you might
have your roots in the City of Lights.

!! Notable Features

Founded soon after [[human]]ity spread across [[Khorvaire]], Fairhaven is a city with a rich history. The capital features straight roads and tidy buildings,
with tree-lined neighborhoods, manicured parks, and
statues depicting great leaders and heroes. Grand
universities fill city blocks, teeming with students and
scholars. Great temples dedicated to the [[Sovereign Host]], mage towers, museums, and more give the city a refined atmosphere. The Royal Court of [[Fairhold]] dominates the metropolis’s impressive
skyline.

Fairhaven is also Aundair’s commercial crossroad. All the [[dragonmarked house]]s have [[enclave]]s here: the [[Aundair Enclave]] is the headquarters of [[Cannith]] West, and the prominent [[Demesne of Memory]] of [[Phiarlan]] exemplifies the written word. Caravans from all across the [[Five Nations]] arrive regularly. Overhead, elemental [[airship]]s drift through the clouds, descending to dock at the sky
tower, while [[elemental galleon]]s prowl the [[Aundair River]], laden with goods being conveyed to and from distant ports. Merchants and traders wheel and deal
with skeptical peasants from the surrounding farmlands in Fairhaven’s numerous marketplaces. The [[Distant Exchange]], a bustling market specializing in
foreign goods, provides silks, exotic consumables, and brilliant artwork from faraway lands, catering to the city’s elite.

Above all, Fairhaven is a city of learning. Schools
ranging from single classrooms to the sprawling [[University of Wynarn]] are home to students from all cultures and races. This crucible produces regular advances in philosophy, magic, sciences, and commerce. Fairhaven’s reputation for scholarship makes education its greatest industry.

Fairhaven is also home to the [[headquarters|Wayfinder Foundation Headquarters]] of the [[Wayfinder Foundation]] and home of its founder, Lord [[Boroman ir'Dayne]].

!! Shape of Fairhaven

Despite Fairhaven's long and storied history, the city has an orderly and geometric design, with brick- or stone-paved streets and stunning towers and minarets. Its grand style hints of something other than human thought, and its layout suggests careful planning. In fact, this orderliness extends to natural features within the area; trees here grow in neat rows without needing to be tended, rocks are situated in geometric patterns, and cattle graze in unison with their left sides facing [[Fairhold]]. All of these phenomena are due to the fact that the area surrounding Fairhaven is a [[manifest zone]] to the Perfect Order of [[Daanvi]], and some of that [[plane]]'s energy bleeds through into the Material Plane here.
