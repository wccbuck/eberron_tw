type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A wilder is someone who spontaneously develops [[psionic power|psionics]], much as a [[sorcerer]] spontaneously develops [[arcane power|arcane magic]]. Though well-trained savants may scoff at the crudeness of the wilders' techniques, they are well aware of how powerful an unleashed mind brimming with psionic energy can be.

Wilders can manifest almost any of the powers of a [[psion]] or [[ardent]], but they are most potent when they harness "psychic surges," brief flashes of psionic energy that ripple through their minds and temporarily heighten their abilities. However, all too often an untrained wilder loses control of a power barely held in check, with disastrous consequences.
