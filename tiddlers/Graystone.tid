Graystone, a [[Cross]] ward in [[Stormreach]], is the main corridor between the [[Marketplace]] and the [[Harbor]] district, and is dominated by the [[House Tharashk Refinery]] at its center. The ward has few residents, its main structures being the refinery and its storehouses and other support buildings, including dormitories for the refineryâ€™s [[human]], [[orc]], [[half-orc]], and occasional [[hill giant]] workers.

[[Havulak Prospecting]] can also be found here, as well as the casino [[Big Bronau's Boat]].
