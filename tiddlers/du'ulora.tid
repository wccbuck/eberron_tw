//This creature is a whirlwind of eyes, wings, and shadow. Dozens of eyes study you as the creature spins about in midair: human eyes, insect eyes, and a luminescent dragon's eye larger than your head. Its wings are an equally unlikely assortment, and it is difficult to see how they can possibly support its weight. A layer of smoky shadows wreathes the entire mass. Three dark tendrils reach out for you, and you feel a wave of hatred slam against your mind.//

Du'ulora [[quori]] are spirits of fury that feed on anger and inspire rage in mortals. A du'ulora can turn a victim's anger into manifested heat; in battle, it grapples its victims and burns them with their own fury.

//''Manipulating Fury.''// While they feed on anger and hatred,
du'ulora rarely act rashly. They are cunning and calculating
strategists who excel at inspiring fury in others and turning
it against them. In battle this can cause their victims to lower
their guard and even to strike their own allies in heedless rage.
As servants of the [[Dreaming Dark]], the du'ulora craft dreams
that stir buried anger and incite hatred; they excel at igniting
feuds and inspiring vendettas. So where a [[tsucora]] agent of the
Dreaming Dark manipulates peoples' fears and a [[hashalaq]]
employs seduction, the du'ulora excel at inciting violence.

//''The Fists of Dal Quor.''// The du'ulora are martial champions
of the quori. They thrive on conflict and love to personally
crush their enemies. While they enjoy fighting in the
vanguard, the du'ulora are also skilled strategists. In [[Dal Quor]],
the du'ulora command squads of [[tsucora]] and lesser [[quori]]. In
[[Riedra]], military commanders are typically [[Inspired]] bound to
du'ulora spirits. (See also [[Fists of Dal Quor]].)

//''Rage Against The Darkness.''// The du'ulora bound to the
[[kalashtar]] serve the light, but they still manipulate fury. Du'ulora
kalashtar learn to harness and channel their own aggression,
and are often fighters or [[barbarian]]s; others are dispassionate
[[monk]]s, who provoke rage in their enemies while never allowing
it to distract them from their goals.
