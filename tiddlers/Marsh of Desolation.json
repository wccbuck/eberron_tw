        "text": "The Marsh of Desolation sits near the base of the [[Skyfall Peninsula]] in northern [[Xen'drik]]. The bog is said to carry the taint of some great evil that lies at its heart, sapping the will of those who enter and consuming their minds like fire. Any metal that enters the swamp very rapidly corrodes, crumbling to dust over the course of a few days.\n\nThe festering marsh is home to uncountable swamp\npredators that hunt and feed on each other. Many of these are [[monstrosities|monstrosity]] not seen anywhere else on Eberron, including green-striped gray tigers with webbed paws. Of the fearsome creatures of the swamp, few\nare higher on the food chain than the [[hydra]]. Some hydras have laired in regions riddled with pockets of flammable gas; such creatures can inhale these gases and ignite them as they exhale, breathing jets of fire at their foes.\n\nThe ''Temple of Sondar Thaj'' lies in the heart of the Marsh of Desolation. In fact, some corrupted artifact or cursed entity within the temple is said to be responsible for the lingering malaise that seems to hang over that swamp. Legends\nsay that it is the resting place of  the [[Crown of Sondar Thaj]], an incredibly powerful [[draconic|dragon]] artifact from the [[Age of Demons]].",
