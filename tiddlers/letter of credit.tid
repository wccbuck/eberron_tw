House [[Kundarak]], the [[dragonmarked house]] that carries the [[Mark of Warding]], operates banks throughout central [[Khorvaire]]. A person who has funds on deposit in a Kundarak bank can request from the bank a letter of credit, which allows them to withdraw funds from a different branch. For many people, this system is a convenient alternative to carrying wealth around in the form of precious gems, jewelry, or coins. House Kundarak does not charge a fee for issuing letters of credit.

House [[Kundarak]] is the only organization that issues letters of credit. Occasionally, an employer secures a letter of credit for an employee—such as an adventurer—who is expected to incur large debts in the course of their work for the employer. The letter specifies a maximum amount available to the bearer, and any sum up to that total amount can be drawn from the issuer's bank account. When funds are withdrawn, the clerks at the bank update the letter to reflect the new available balance, notarizing the change to the letter or issuing a new letter.

Letters of credit are always notarized with [[Sivis]] [[arcane mark]]s, making them difficult to forge. Even if a document can be successfully reproduced, however, it is nearly impossible to acquire funds from House [[Kundarak]] using a forged letter of credit, since the house keeps records of every such letter it issues and makes those records available to all its banks. If a clerk at a bank has any reason to suspect that a letter is forged, it can be checked against house records to verify its authenticity.
