type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

There is only one safe harbor on the island of [[Dreadhold]], and there lies the garrison village of Gaolgate. Every building supports the prison in some way, from the massive smithy to the small brewery. A fleet of fishing boats brings in food for the villagers and the prison, as the waters around the island teem with fish. Gaolgate is not designed with the comfort of travelers in mind, but there is one large inn—The Gallows—which caters to the crews of support ships and prison transports. Most of the inhabitants of the island are [[Kundarak]] [[dwarves|dwarf]], but there are a few [[gnome]]s from House [[Sivis]] who manage the [[message station|speaking stone]]s of the island. There are also a handful of others, mostly being former prisoners who chose to remain on the island after serving their sentences.

!! Residents of Gaolgate

While most of the guards of [[Dreadhold]] prison live in the garrison town of Gaolgate, other island residents spend most of their time in town and are only called to the prison when their skills are needed or when working on a specific project. The inhabitants of Gaolgate have two things in common: Most are highly skilled in a specific trade or craft, assuring everyone has something to contribute to the community, and the vast majority are trained for combat, ready to grab a waraxe and join the fray should the island fall under attack or a prison break occur.

!! The Trench

A winding, 10-foot-wide and 15-foot-deep trench leads up from the village. Three gate stations stand along the way, each manned by two wand guards and a scout. While there are curves in the path, the final 400 feet of the trench is a straight line to the prison, ending smoothly in a path that winds around to the main gate.
