However, her coronation was not to be. Her\nbrother [[Thalin|Thalin ir'Wynarn]] of [[Thrane]] asserted that he should take\nthe throne. [[Kaius|Kaius ir'Wynarn I]] of [[Karrnath]] and [[Wroann|Wroann ir'Wynarn]] of [[Breland]] shared Thalin’s notion that succession of the eldest was\na worn-out tradition. Only [[Wrogar|Wrogar ir'Wynarn]] of [[Aundair]] stood\nwith Mishann and her rightful claim. Before the year\nhad ended, the [[Last War]] began. Galifar collapsed into\nhostile nations, with each ir’Wynarn sibling eventually\nclaiming rights to the Galifar crown.\n\nIn 908 YK, Mishann was assassinated by the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]]. Mishann was succeeded by her son Brusst ir'Wynarn.",
