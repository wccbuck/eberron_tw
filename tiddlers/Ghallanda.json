So good to see you again. Let me get your drink—blackroot tal with honey, yes? And then you have to listen to this story I've heard about the strange things going on in the Cogs.//\n\n<div align=\"right\">—Alara d'Ghallanda, halfling bartender</div>\n\nThe majority of inns, taverns, and restaurants in the\n[[Five Nations]] are either directly owned by House Ghallanda or licensed by its Hosteler's Guild. Most people\ngive little thought to House Ghallanda; when compared\nto the soldiers of House [[Deneith]] and the factories of\nHouse [[Cannith]], an alliance of innkeepers seems harmless and inconsequential. But Ghallanda's strength lies\nin charm and connections. A Ghallanda innkeeper hears\nmany things—if you want to know what's really going\non in a community, talk to the [[halfling]] bartender. The\nleaders of House Ghallanda don't sell information; they\nprefer to build friendship and deal in favors. But should\na Ghallanda baron ever truly need something, they likely\nhave a favor they can call in.\n\nGhallanda has a number of \"bound businesses\"—franchises run directly by the house. The [[Gold Dragon Inn]] is such a business, with Gold Dragon Inns being found in every major city, each serving a familiar menu and providing similar services. But many Ghallanda heirs take\npride in creating their own unique businesses. There are\nalso many independent restaurants, inns, and taverns\nlicensed by House Ghallanda. The [[blink dog]] emblem is\nan assurance that a locale meets Ghallanda standards of\nhealth and quality—but not every inn is run by a [[halfling]].\n\nHouse Ghallanda's mandate extends beyond providing\ncreature comforts to travelers. Every one of the house's\n[[enclave]]s—which are more numerous than those of any\nother [[dragonmarked house]]—is a sanctuary beyond the\nlegal reach of any government or [[dragonmarked house]].\nBaron [[Yoren|Yoren d'Ghallanda]] and his daughter [[Chervina|Chervina d'Ghallanda]] have greatly expanded the house's presence even in remote areas such as the edge of the [[Demon Wastes]], guided by their study\nof the [[Draconic Prophecy]]. \n\n!! History of House {{!!title}}\n\nMore than 2,600 years ago, the [[Mark of Hospitality]] started appearing\namong the nomadic [[halfling]] tribes of\nthe [[Talenta Plains]]. Those who manifested the mark tended to congregate\ntogether and eventually took the name\nGhallanda, meaning “helpful hounds.”\nMoving from oasis to outpost across\neastern [[Khorvaire]], the Ghallandas\noffered food and shelter to any fellow\ntravelers, and they were instrumental\nin quelling feuds, monster depredations,\nand other local concerns at each stop.\n\nWhen [[Karrn the Conqueror]] explored the [[Talenta Plains]], the other [[dragonmarked house]]s discovered the Ghallandas. After countless hours at\nthe bargaining table, the other houses recognized\nthe Ghallandas as a full-fledged house, and House\nGhallanda started spreading across [[Khorvaire]], first\nestablishing inns and taverns and then constructing\n[[enclave]]s from the [[Barren Sea]] to the [[Lhazaar Sea]].\n\n!!! The Last War\n\nWhen House [[Deneith]] mercenaries marched into battle early in the [[Last War]], they\nhad a contingent from House Ghallanda marching with them to provide food and shelter in the field. Other armies noticed how useful the magical creations of the Ghallandas were, and eventually all sides were hiring House Ghallanda to furnish provisions and supplies for their rear echelons. In the\nchaos of war, House Ghallanda sometimes found\nitself on the front lines, and its promises to remain a\nnoncombatant weren’t always kept. As a result, House\nGhallanda has more than a few capable veteran soldiers among its ranks today.\n\n!!
