type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This fine grey cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 3 feet in diameter. When unfolded, it activates the [[floating disk]] spell imbued within. The fabric circle then functions as the plane of force created by that spell, and lasts until you fold the disk or your attunement to this item is broken.
