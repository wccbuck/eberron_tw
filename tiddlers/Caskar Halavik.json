        "text": "Caskar Halavik ([[halfling]] councilor for [[Middle Menthis]]) was born in the [[Talenta Plains]]. When he first came to [[Sharn]], he worked as an enforcer for the [[Boromar Clan]]. He was also a remarkably skilled [[clawfoot]] racer, and in time he became a celebrity in [[Little Plains]]. [[Saidan Boromar]] helped him transform his fame into political cachet, eventually earning him a seat on the [[Council|Sharn Council]]. Caskar enjoys the prestige of his position, but he prefers to leave political maneuvering on behalf of the Boromars to [[Ilyra Boromar]] and [[Bestan ir'Tonn]].",
