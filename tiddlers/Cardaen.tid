Cardaen is a [[patron ancestor]] of the [[Tairnadal]], and is known as one of the greatest [[elf]] [[wizard]]s ever to have lived.

In the days of the [[Cul'sir Dominion|Cul'sir]] in the [[Age of Giants]], the elves were enslaved by the [[titan|giant]]s. But there was magic in their blood, a potential that the giants could not match... and when [[Cul'sir]] saw that potential in a slave, he raised him as one of his own. So it was with the arcane prodigy Cardaen. He was born in a high tower, and Cul’sir made sure Cardaen’s feet never touched the ground. Cardaen crafted mystic weapons for the [[giant]]s, never knowing that they were used against his own kind. 

Cardaen cared only for magic—until he met [[Vadallia]]. The Queen of Swords caught a glimpse of Cardaen through her crystal eye and knew that his magic could turn the tide of the war. And so she led her band into the heart of Cul’sir’s Throne and carried the [[wizard]] away with her. It was a dangerous move, and it allowed Cul’sir to place a [[scrying]] trace upon Vadallia. The giant then assembled his army for war.

As she prepared for battle, [[Vadallia]] urged Cardaen to fight at her side. Though her words touched his heart, Cardaen still thought of the [[giant]]s as his kin instead of his captors, and he refused to raise his hand against them. Vadallia pleaded with him, telling him that his true people needed him, and still he resisted. In the end Vadallia fought the battle without him, while he watched from afar. Her warriors battled without fear, and her strategies were brilliant. [[Drow|drow]] and [[giant]] fell before the united clans. Then [[Cul'sir]] unleashed a terrible weapon, a lingering curse that rotted the bones within the body. It was a spell Cardaen had created, and when he saw it used and realized the suffering he had brought to his own kind, he was filled with horror. He took to the battlefield and shattered the curse. His fury lent him strength, and he blunted every spell the [[giant]]s threw against him. For the first time in his life, the Titan King knew fear; he fled the battlefield, and his host was scattered to the far corners of the earth. Yet Cardaen’s revelation had come too late for Vadallia. He found her on the battlefield, mortally wounded by the curse he had made. No one knows what words passed between them before she died; when he left the battlefield there were tears on his cheeks, and he held her crystal eye in his hand. From that day forward he was a force for vengeance, and the giants feared his name.

When [[Aeren]] led the elves to their [[haven|Aerenal]], Cardaen remained behind. He remembered [[Vadallia]]’s vision—that the elves would never see peace while [[Cul'sir]] still lived. His final fate remains a mystery. But by the time the elves reached Aeren’s Rest, Cul’sir had fallen... and so their future was secured.

!! Cardaen's Chosen

Cardaen was an [[arcane|arcane magic]] prodigy, raised by [[giant]]s and taught to love magic above all else. In his early life, he was completely absorbed with study. He had no interest in how the rituals he crafted were used; he simply sought to push the laws of magic to their limits. After Vadallia’s death, he realized that magic was pointless if it did not have purpose. He dedicated his life to vengeance, hunting down and punishing those who brought suffering to his people.

Cardaen is widely considered to be one of the greatest [[elf]] [[wizard]]s of history, commanding respect from the [[Aereni]] and [[Tairnadal]] alike. [[Tairnadal]] chosen by Cardaen invariably develop remarkable arcane talent. Some Cardaens are cold and dispassionate, while others see beauty in magic, but all are known for their intellectual pursuits. Some Tairnadal say that to be a true [[revenant|Spirits of the Past]] of his, an [[elf]] must begin with an innocent love of magic and be hardened by a terrible loss. Following his legacy, Cardaen revenants may choose two very different paths—that of [[zaeltairn]] or [[zaelantar]], war or peace. Those who choose to be warriors tend to embrace Cardaen’s vengeful nature in defense of their people. But others choose the settled life and focus on arcane research in the few cities of the Tairnadal. While “peaceful” by comparison, such revenants are typically cold-blooded in their use of magic.

To date, Cardaen has never produced an [[artificer]], and an artificer who follows this path would stand out among their kin.

!! Artifacts

Cardaen died in Xen'drik before the exodus, and his [[spellbook]] has never been found; it’s possible it contains [[spell]]s he never shared with others. His staff was a powerful magical weapon, and it is also lost to time. Over the centuries, explorers and scholars have occasionally found [[spell scroll]]s written by this great wizard, and one might surface in [[Xen'drik]] or elsewhere.
