Sirens are a variety of [[merfolk]] that have adapted the ability to weave [[illusion]] and [[enchantment]] magic into their beautiful singing voices. Much like [[harpies|harpy]], sirens have a reputation for using this power to prey on unsuspecting explorers. However, the arrival of a [[Kalamer|Karakala]] siren to a village on the southern coast of [[Khorvaire]] is a celebrated event; even the [[Ghaal'dar]] welcome friendly sirens. These [[bard]]s bring news and stories of the sea—of ships in the area, storms, or even just gossip from the next village down the coast—combined with enthralling song.
