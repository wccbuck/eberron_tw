Olva ([[half-orc]]) is the local healer, augur, surgeon, and poisoner of [[Dhavin's Post]]. In her shop, she offers a variety of [[potion]]s, [[poison]]s, and other alchemical items. Additionally, the characters can order special poisons from her; the price
depending on the complexity. She is middle-aged and dyes her
hair blue with a special tincture she creates. She wears bones as
jewelry, like a necklace made of the bones of her forbears, and
tunnel earrings made of thigh bones. She is sly but no fraudster.

Her shop looks like a curiosity cabinet, at least to visitors from
distant regions. The characters see snakes, frogs, and other
vertebrates suspended in jars, shrunken heads arranged like
lampions, and many herbs that hang from the ceiling to dry.
