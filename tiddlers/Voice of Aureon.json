        "text": "The Voice of [[Aureon]] is a religious order within House [[Medani]] which trains those who can use their [[Mark of Detection]] to glimpse the past or future; once they have learned how to unlock the full power of their [[dragonmark]], these gifted oracles are known as [[Medani prophet]]s. \n\nThe headquarters of the organization is located in [[Wroat]] within the [[Tower of Inquisition]], and it is led by Seneschal [[Ruram d'Medani]]. The Voice has a loose structure, with three administrators (known as speakers) assisting Ruram in overseeing the operations of the order. Beneath the speakers, every prophet holds equal authority.\n\nFew can master the gift of prophecy, and while major [[Medani]] [[enclave]]s contain shrines to [[Aureon]], only a few of these are permanently tended by a priest or prophet of the Voice.",
