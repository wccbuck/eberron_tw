        "text": "[[Graywall]] is a young town that\nwas built to house thousands. The Hydra Halls are\nmass dormitories, and each is virtually identical in\nlayout and appearance to the others. The only distinctive feature of a hall is the unique icon painted above the main entrance. As such, an [[ogre]] knows\nthat he lives in the Eye or the Claw. Most of the halls\nare assigned to specific work crews, but a few have rooms available for monstrous travelers on a barter basis. The halls are spread around the two enormous [[grist]] mills, where the laborers go for food, drink, and [[harpy]] song.",
