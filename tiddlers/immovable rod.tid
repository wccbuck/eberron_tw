title: immovable rod
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place (in the frame of reference it is in when the button is pressed). Until you or another creature pushes the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall.
