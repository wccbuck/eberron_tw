This magic sword helps a [[bard]] more effectively add insult to injury. When you cast the [[vicious mockery]] spell while holding this weapon, any words you use to insult the creature appear written along the blade for 1 minute or until replaced by a new insult. If you strike that same creature while words are written on the blade, repeat the effect of the [[vicious mockery]] spell on that creature.
