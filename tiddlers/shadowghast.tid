A shadowghast is a [[ghoul]] imbued with overwhelming negative energy. Leaping out from the shadows and trailing tendrils of darkness, it closes in on its prey with nary a sound, then tears into a victim with its paralyzing claws and furious bite. Usually the only clue a victim has before being torn to shreds is a horrific stench of the grave.
