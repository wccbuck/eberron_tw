        "text": "Brilliant and charismatic, Kolas Verdgrin was one of [[Breland]]’s finest generals of the [[Redcloak Battalion]] during the [[Last War]]. As he served in the war, he became increasingly bloodthirsty and infamous for terror tactics, butchery, and the mistreatment of prisoners. His acts weighed heavily on the heart of King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]], who wished to win the war with a clean conscience. In 994 YK, Kolas finally went too far. After he massacred a peaceful monastic community in [[Cyre]], Boranel stripped the general of command. The king could not bear to execute him after so many years of service, but he was also aware of the dangers presented by Kolas’s fanatical followers. In the end, he shipped Kolas to [[Dreadhold]] and dispersed his soldiers among other units. \n\nKolas resides in the Golden Ward. Now in his early forties, he is a handsome and well-spoken man. He conceals his ruthless temperament beneath a façade of charm. Kolas still has loyal followers in [[Breland]] who believe his ruthless temperament is required to lead Breland to dominance.",
