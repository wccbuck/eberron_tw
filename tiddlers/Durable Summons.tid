''Prerequisite:'' [[Arcane Tradition]] ([[conjuration]]).

Any creature that you summon or create with a [[conjuration]] spell gains 3 temporary [[harm]] boxes. This extra durability can be represented by 3 additional segments on the creature's [[progress clock]], if that makes more sense for the scene.
