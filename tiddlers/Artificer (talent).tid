xpcost: 1

As an [[artificer]], you have studied the workings of magic and how to
channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained
the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don't appear
to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if
you're producing wonders using mundane items or outÂ­landish inventions. If you cast [[cure wounds]] using [[alchemist's supplies]], you could be quickly
producing a salve. If you cast it using [[tinker's tools]], you
might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds
wounds. When you cast [[poison spray]], you could fling foul
chemicals or use a wand that spits venom.

Choose two spells as per the [[Spellcaster]]/[[2|Spellcaster 2]]/[[3|Spellcaster 3]] talent rules. An [[artificer]] might choose from the following spells. //Recommended Spell: [[magical tinkering]].//
