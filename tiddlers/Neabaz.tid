The [[rakshasa]] Neabaz, the Voice of Chaos, the Herald of Lies, is the [[chosen servant|prakhutu]] of the [[overlord]] [[Eldrantulku]]. The [[Draconic Prophecy]] has revealed that Eldrantulku will rise again when a mighty empire tears itself apart from within. Neabaz helped instigate the elven uprising in [[Xen'drik]] during the [[Age of Giants]], and played a part in shattering the Empire of [[Dhakaan]]. Now he whispers in the shadows of [[Khorvaire]], hoping to bring down the last remnants of [[Galifar]]. His underlings encourage anti-monarchy groups (such as the [[Swords of Liberty]]) and those who wish to see the war begin anew.

In his preferred form, Neabaz appears as a smoothly polite, handsome, white-furred [[rakshasa]], with tiny pointed horns and transparent, housefly-like wings. But no matter what form he takes, he is almost always dressed impeccably, and has a special fondness for capes of silk and hats of rich, blood-red, fur felt. In addition to his considerable magical abilities, Neabaz can open his mouth and unfurl a foot-long proboscis from which he can suck blood.

Neabaz has a permanent telepathic connection to three of his primary servants, which he calls his "claws." One such claw is [[Thelestes]], the [[succubus|incubus/succubus]]. Beyond these, Neabaz also commands a great many [[chasme]] demons, and an untold number of tiny fiendish flies which serve as his eyes and ears.
