title: Interlude: Entering Starilaskur
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Arien and [[Dowin Lin Adredar]] go to [[Dragon's Crown]] to investigate it. Dowin takes a sample, says there's evidence it's connected to [[Lamannia]] and maybe [[Xoriat]] but it's not clear. Arien talks to a guy who 

Have a scene with a village elder talking about holding a "hallmote" to determine what the village will do. [[Nelview]] is about as big as Mistmarsh, they have a [[speaking stone]]; they probably will send word to ir'Clarn (maybe [[Hatheril]]?) and maybe also to the crown. But likely they'll hold the [[Prophet]] for a while before they execute him (or hand him off to higher authorities). Don't forget that the Prophet refused Arien's magical healing.

Make it to [[Heeson's Ferry]], get on the [[lightning rail]] to [[Starilaskur]]. Let's not do a lightning rail heist quite yet, save it for the second/third time Arien gets on the train.

Stuff that could happen on the lightning rail:

* A [[warforged]] quietly reads a book called //The Machine Manifesto//.
* A bored [[changeling]] child practices duplicating the faces of the guests. Not all of them are amused.
* A [[halfling]] leads a tiny pet dinosaur on a leash, tugging at it whenever it tries to examine something.

(These things didn't happen:)

* A human pickpocket circulates among the passengers, looking for another victim.
* An older human reads the [[Korranberg Chronicle]], loudly proclaiming outrage at every story.

Approaching Starilaskur, the lightning rail passes through several small farming villages. It also passes over the Runnels, a region of wetland with thick shrubs and beautiful wildflowers.

Make it to [[Starilaskur]]. Arien sees the smokestacks of Gorgon Gates pumping out thick grey smoke. Brick buildings of yellow and brown line the lightning rail line; strings of brightly-colored pennants are hung above the rail as they approach the station. The station is in the Weaversong district. [[Dowin|Dowin Lin Adredar]] takes a different cart than Arien; he's going to the Aureonaeum in Lorikur Heights, while she's going to the [[Martial Temple|Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]] in Faneside, but he says she should visit him whenever she likes. As she leaves the [[lightning rail]] station in a cart and rides through the streets, Arien can hear the rhythmic clicks of the industrial looms creating textiles; all of the looms across multiple factories seem to be in sync. She can also hear singing voices rise up from the factories to the beat of the looms.

The journey to the temple passes through "Little Cyre", the neighborhood formerly known as Kemble Ridge. She sees tents set up in parks and plazas.

Enter the Faneside neighborhood, and approach the [[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]]. The temple is actually more of a campus, with multiple buildings connected to a central cloister. But the main church is very impressive, located on the east side of the complex, with massive windows facing east to let in the light of the dawn. The main entrance has a quote: "Pray for peace. Prepare for war." Just inside is a dedication plaque, mentioning the [[liturgical council]], the "Vassal Assembly", dedicated this facility in 751 YK (247 years ago).

A guard at the gate takes Arien through the complex. She sees the main cloister, an open square with covered walks; there are lovely gardens and seating areas in the square, but also there are novices training and sparring with wooden swords.

The guard leads Arien to the school hall, where they find the Novice-master, [[Wroenna Lonn]], mopping the hallway beside several novices. Introductions. Wroenna gives a tour of the facilities as they talk. 

Wroenna explained the school and stuff, also Arien kept looking at her glowing chest, so Wroenna explained what that's about. After she took her paladin oath ([[Oath of Devotion]]), her heart began to glow brilliantly. She took it as a sign from [[Dol Arrah]] not to hide her light under a bushel. Wroenna had highly valued humility, but she realized it wasn't a positive ideal for her, but rather something she used to shirk responsibility. Her glowing heart reminds her that she is a burning torch for Dol Arrah, that she can perform miracles, that she is blessed and chosen to manifest Dol Arrah's light in the world.

Each divine-touched person at the academy (about 50 novices, clerics, paladins, and friars) has different gifts, so the academy does not train them to be part of the normal operation of the military, move in formation, etc. In general, the academy is focused on training individuals with signs of divine power to be "mavericks" or specially assigned knights. That said, they are still subjected to rigorous physical training and weapons training. And for the folks who are on a track to join the [[King's Swords]] or [[King's Shields]], special training is available, but generally special-forces training is done in [[Wroat]].

[[Wroenna|Wroenna Lonn]] tells Arien about the oaths of a [[paladin]], and how these oaths strengthen and focus one's divine magic. 

Wroenna says Arien needs to meet with Preceptor [[Belmin|Cadoc Belmin]] and Prior [[Aggan|Hemdoth Aggan]] before she can be formally admitted, but they almost certainly will accept her.
