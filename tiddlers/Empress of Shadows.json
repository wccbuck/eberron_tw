        "text": "The Empress of Shadows of the [[Amaranthine City]] of [[Mabar]] is the first and greatest of the [[Dark Power]]s.  Her defining principle is hunger,\nthe desire to consume all that is light, to expand her empire\nacross eternity. \n\nShe prefers an elegant [[fiend]]ish form, with\npolished horns and chitin plates engraved with arcane sigils,\nbut she can take the shape of any [[yugoloth]]. She spends much\nof her time presiding over the decaying pomp and grandeur of\nthe Amaranthine City, but also closely monitors the campaigns\nin the [[Hinterlands]] and occasionally takes time to torment\nher hostages. The sages of [[Syrania]] believe that the Empress\nof Shadows chooses which fragments of other planes will be\npulled into [[Mabar]], and planar emissaries sometimes dwell in\nthe Amaranthine City seeking to negotiate with her.\n\nThe [[Irian]] counterpart of the Empress of Shadows is the [[Dawn Empress]].",
