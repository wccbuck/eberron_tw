        "text": "Alben ir'Clarn, the youngest son of Lord [[Ruken ir'Clarn]], serves as the Count of [[Harkenwold]], a county in [[Breland]] which includes [[Harkenton]] and [[Mistmarsh]]. He has been a friend to the people of the county and is well respected, though they fear he does not pay enough attention to their warnings about the perils of the Mistmarsh Swamp. He splits his time between the town of [[Harkenton]], the seat of the county, and [[Wroat]], where he vacations and visits with his father. Whenever he is away, he leaves his majordomo [[Jonn Stockmer]] in charge, an aging man who has served as Harkenton Keep's steward for 45 years.",
