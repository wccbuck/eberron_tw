The [[dwarves|dwarf]] of the [[Mror Holds]] and the [[orc]]s of [[Jhorash'tar]] occupy this mountainous region that separates [[Karrnath]] from the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. The Mror call the entire region //tra Mroreln//, the Iron Roots. When [[human]]s first came to [[Khorvaire]] and settled the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], they called the foreboding range to the west the Hoarfrost Mountains.

Today, the Mror and most others refer to the entire region as the Ironroot Mountains. However, the people of the Lhazaar Principalities still call them the Hoarfrost, and some people use this term to refer to the mountains east of [[Mirror Lake]].

The Ironroot Mountains hold some of the richest mineral deposits on [[Khorvaire]], making the [[Mror Holds]] a primary source for iron, copper, gold, platinum, and other vital ores.
