type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The farming community of Wolf’s Paw, located in the northeastern farmland of the [[Eldeen Reaches]], is one of the relatively few permanent
[[shifter]] communities in the Reaches. Most shifters either
live among other [[humanoid]]s in their communities or
wander in small nomadic tribes in the [[Towering Wood]].

The leader of this shifter farming community is ''Slara'', a [[ranger]] who founded the thorp a decade ago. Spiritual guidance comes from the [[druid]] ''Lorgan'', whose ties
to the [[Wardens of the Wood]] have proved beneficial to the
community on more than one occasion.

In addition to farming, the townsfolk make periodic
trips into the [[Wolfwood]] near [[Havenglen]] to hunt for meat. These
hunts have an almost religious significance for the community, and many traditions and ceremonies dating back
to their time as a nomadic pack find outlets in the forest.

The community also possesses a secret that no one outside
its ranks is aware of. Slara’s grandsire, the ancient ''Thorntuft'', is actually a [[werewolf]] in hiding. Thorntuft rarely ventures far
from Slara’s homestead; he is content to sit in the sun and
enjoy his role as historian and advisor to the community.
Only occasionally does he desire to shift and do a little hunting of his own—always being
careful not to spread the curse during his hunts.
