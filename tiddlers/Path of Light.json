        "text": "* We live in an age of darkness. We must find the path that leads to the light.\n* Act with compassion and courage. Each noble act is a step on the path.\n* Hone your body and your mind. You are the tool you will use to change reality.\n\nPracticed by many [[kalashtar]], the Path of Light seeks to change reality by first bringing change within, using meditation to focus the mind and athletic discipline to improve the body. The next step brings light into the world, using courage and compassion to banish the darkness in the people around you. Mediate disputes. Extinguish hatred by guiding people out of darkness. Inspire people to be better than they are. Even the smallest change is a victory, yet lightbringers—the followers of this path—hope that this is merely a step on a greater journey.\n\nThe Path of Light teaches that this age is dominated\nby [[il-Lashtavar]], \"the great [[darkness that dreams|Dreaming Dark]].\" This\nforce poisons the world and promotes darkness. But all\nthings change. If enough light can enter the world, it will\nlead to a tidal shift: the age of il-Lashtavar will end and\nusher in the time of il-Yannah, the great light.\n\nSome followers of this faith believe that meditation\nalone is sufficient to change the path of the world, that\nmerely contemplating the light is sufficient to bring\nabout the change. Most believe that it is necessary to\ntake action, but that darkness must fought with light.\nViolence is never the answer, and the only way to defeat\nevil is to redeem it. Lightbringers seek to inspire those\nwho live in fear and enlighten those whose evil is driven\nby ignorance. The faith has followed this path for over\na thousand years, but now a splinter sect advocates\ngreater action. These shadow watchers believe that evil\nmust be fought, that sources of darkness that poison\ncommunities can and should be ruthlessly eliminated.\n\nThe Path of Light is taught to the [[kalashtar]] by the\nspirits bound to their bloodlines. It is widespread in the\nnation of [[Adar]] in distant [[Sarlona]], but in [[Khorvaire]], it is\nlargely unknown outside kalashtar communities. The\nshadow watchers champion a sect born in Khorvaire,\nand the elders of Adar have condemned its methods.\n\nIf you follow the Path of Light, you must choose your\nside. As a lightbringer, you seek to spread hope and\ngoodwill. As a shadow watcher, you hunt down and eliminate sources of darkness. Which path will you follow? \n\n!! Symbol\n\nThe symbol of the Path of Light is a shard of brilliant\ncrystal, carried or worn as an amulet. This crystal may\nbe used as a holy symbol; if it's worn as a necklace, the\npriest must place one hand on it to use it as a focus. The\nformal garb of a priest includes a headdress with curving horns and points made from a Sarlonan shell-like material called [[sentira]]. \n\n!! Rites\n\nPhysical and mental discipline are important virtues of\nthe Path of Light. Martial arts (see [[Path of Shadows]]) and guided meditation become a form of devotion and prayer. A [[kalashtar]] priest\nconducts services telepathically, using shrines designed\nto amplify psychic abilities and allowing them to share\nthoughts and images directly with the congregation. To\nan outsider, a service can appear silent and tranquil despite being an ecstatic experience for the faithful. \n\n!! Temples\n\nThe nation of [[Adar]] in [[Sarlona]] is home to vast fortress\nmonasteries devoted to the Path of Light. In [[Khorvaire]],\na mere handful of shrines appear in cities with large\nkalashtar communities. These shrines are calm and\npeaceful, the air scented with Sarlonan incense. The\nchambers are open, providing space for martial arts.\nLabyrinthine patterns engraved on the floors serve as\nan aid to meditation, while the walls hold crystals that\nfocus and amplify the psychic abilities of the priests.
