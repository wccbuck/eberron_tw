        "text": "The Unchained practice one of the most subtle and powerful forms of rebellion in [[Riedra]]. They dream. The founder of\nthe movement was a human named ''Sulaan'', a merchant\nwho was fascinated by the free dreams he experienced in\nother lands. Sulaan eventually learned about the [[dreamspace]]. He decided to spread free dreams to the people of [[Riedra]], believing that doing this was the key to change\nin the world.\n\nSulaan disappeared five years ago, and many assume\nthat he was taken by the [[Thousand Eyes]]. However,\nsome of the Unchained have received dreams of contact from Sulaan. None can say if these are truly the work of the enigmatic founder, or if the [[quori]] are masquerading as Sulaan and using this guise to manipulate his followers.\n\nThe Unchained are loosely organized, and most members know only others in their own communities. A few gifted dreamers use a [[dream of contact]] to maintain communication between distant villages, but the Unchained have no grand scheme. Members work to identify others who share their ideas and to teach the ways of the [[dreamtouched]]. In the eyes of the Unchained, dreams alone can win the battle.\n\n''Getting the PCs Involved:'' The Unchained can be\nuseful allies for the PCs precisely because of their passive\nstance. They can be hidden anywhere in [[Riedra]], and as\nfree thinkers, they can choose to help persecuted characters. They aren't willing to use violence and have limited\nresources, but they can provide advice and shelter, and\npotentially a [[dream of contact]]. \n\nSee also [[Ilaan]].",
