This whip is made from the tendrils of a [[roper]]. The wielder of this whip may use it to grapple an opponent. If successful, the tendrils wrap around the target, and the target's effective physical strength is cut in half until the tendrils are removed (as if under the effects of the spell [[ray of enfeeblement]]).
