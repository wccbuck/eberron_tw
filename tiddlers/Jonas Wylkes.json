But responsibility has been thrust upon him\ntoo soon. Lord Jonas has close ties to the [[Golden Lions]]; only a few years ago, he was an active member of this gang. Now he is a socialite, spending\nmore time at [[Shadows]] or the [[Red Ring]] than he does on\nhis familial duties. He is easily distracted by decadent\npleasures. In the meantime, the edifice carefully built\nby his predecessors is beginning to crumble. House\n[[Lyrandar]] (via Viceroy [[Calynden|Calynden d'Lyrandar]]) is already working on renegotiating its\narrangements with the city, and others are following\nsuit. The [[Aurum]] has extended an invitation to young\nJonas, though this is hardly public knowledge. Both\nhave offered to help him manage the family business, each hoping to turn the Harbor Lord’s domain into an extension of its own organization. For the\nmoment, the indecisive lord is stalling on any firm\nalliance, but he is swiftly becoming overwhelmed by\nthe insistent proposals.\n\nLord Jonas’s mother, [[Tulea Wylkes]], is horrified by\nwhat has become of her family, but she cannot bring\nherself to turn on her son.",
