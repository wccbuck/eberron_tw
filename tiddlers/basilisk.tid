Basilisks are predatory reptiles native to a variety of climates. They are not particularly fast on their feet, but they needn't chase prey. Meeting a basilisk's supernatural gaze can be enough to affect a rapid transformation, transforming a victim into porous stone. Basilisks, with their strong jaws, are able to consume the stone. The stone returns to organic form in the basilisk's gullet.

Some alchemists are said to know how to process the basilisk's gullet and the fluids contained within. Properly handled, the gullet produces an [[oil|basilisk oil]] that can return petrified creatures to flesh and life.
