Divine energy radiates from you, distorting and diffusing magical energy within 30 feet of you. The sphere moves with you, centered on you. For up to 10 minutes (or until your concentration breaks), each friendly creature in the area (including you) has [[advantage]] on when defending against spells and other magical effects. The circle also reduces [[consequence]]s/[[impact]] for spells that make it through.
