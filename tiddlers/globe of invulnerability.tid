An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for up to ten minutes (or until your concentration breaks).

Any [[spell]] of rare or lower [[spell tier]] from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.
