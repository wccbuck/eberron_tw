While the main offices are located in\n[[Korranberg]], the Chronicle employs chroniclers far and wide,\nand maintains field offices in every major nation. House\n[[Orien]] distributes each edition (the Chronicle appears three\ndays a week; [[Mol, Wir, and Far|Khorvaire calendar]]) along its mail and [[lightning rail]] runs, allowing the Chronicle to reach a huge audience. Indeed, almost everyone in the [[Five Nations]] knows the Chronicle slogan: “If it happens in the Five Nations, you'll\nread about it in the //Korranberg Chronicle//.”",
