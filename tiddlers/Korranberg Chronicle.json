The Chronicle is published by the [[gnome]] Cassia Lor­ridan Claddik, who is the public face of the publication and has close ties to [[Korranberg]]'s ruling Council of Nine.\n\nA typical edition of the //Korranberg Chronicle// features\nnews from around the [[Five Nations]], [[Zilargo]], and the [[Mror Holds]], as well as stories of adventurers and exciting expeditions, business solicitations, royal proclamations, and\nalmanac information. While the main offices are located in\n[[Korranberg]], the Chronicle employs chroniclers far and wide,\nand maintains field offices in every major nation. House\n[[Orien]] distributes each edition (the Chronicle appears three\ndays a week; [[Mol, Wir, and Far|Khorvaire calendar]]) along its mail and [[lightning rail]] runs, allowing the Chronicle to reach a huge audience. Indeed, almost everyone in the [[Five Nations]] knows the Chronicle slogan: “If it happens in the Five Nations, you'll\nread about it in the //Korranberg Chronicle//.”\n\n!!!
