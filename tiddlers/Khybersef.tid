''Date: '' [[21 Vult|Khorvaire calendar]]

On the longest night of the
year, when light and goodness seem to be at their
weakest, the Purified of the [[Silver Flame]] believe that the bonds holding the fiendish [[overlord]]s in [[Khyber]] are also at their
weakest and that the world is in its greatest danger.
Many quests and crusades are launched on Khybersef (a shortened, dialectical form of “Khyber’s Eve”).
