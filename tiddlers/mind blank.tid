You touch a creature and completely shield its mind from magic. Until the spell ends 24 hours later, one willing creature you touch is immune to [[psychic damage|damage type]], any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, [[divination]] spells, and the [[charm]]ed condition. The spell even foils [[wish]] spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target's mind or to gain information about the target.
