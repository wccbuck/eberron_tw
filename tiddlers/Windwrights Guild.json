Any job on\nan [[elemental galleon]] or an elemental [[airship]] is prized\nover one at the dry docks or in the warehouses.\n\nThe Windwrights Guild also allows independent\nshipping concerns to pay for the right to fly the House\n[[Lyrandar]] flag and to get shipping contracts directly\nfrom the Windwrights. Most independent ship captains consider the Lyrandar flag to be a deterrent to pirates. Some think that it wards off bad weather, too.\n\nThe headquarters of the Windwrights Guild is technically [[Stormhome]], but over the last four decades, much of the guild's administration has been transferred to the [[Lyrandar]] [[enclave]] in [[Taer Valaestas]].",
