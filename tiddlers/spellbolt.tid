Developed by House [[Cannith]] near the end of the [[Last War]], a spellbolt functions as a sort of magical grenade. Each spellbolt’s arcane payload is triggered by the kinetic
formula of a [[Cannith crossbow]] (Spark, Lightning, or Thunderbolt), allowing an archer to shoot a target and affect them with a spell. Effectively, a spellbolt is like a [[scroll|spell scroll]] or [[potion]]—a consumable [[magic item]] holding a single charge of a spell—with the advantage of delivering that effect at a longer range. 

These bolts are a recent innovation, and House [[Cannith]] has thus far
only created spellbolts using [[arcane|arcane magic]] [[spell]]s of up to [[uncommon tier|spell tier]]. Though spellbolts aren’t widespread in the [[Five Nations]], they have the same [[cost|money]] and [[rarity]] as a [[scroll|spell scroll]] of the same spell.
