type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In the [[Storyloom]] system, when player characters are injured, they mark boxes of [[harm]] on their [[character sheet|character sheet template]]. Ordinarily, each harm box requires one day of rest to recover, assuming the character has access to medical attention.

However, some [[spell]]s, such as [[cure wounds]] or [[healing word]], or items such as [[potions of healing|potion of healing]], can rapidly accelerate the recovery of injuries through the use of magic. Like other effects, these magical healing effects have an associated [[impact]] determined by the tier of the effect and other factors as determined by the GM. 

|![[Impact|impact]] |!Result of Magical Healing |
|1 (Low) |Clear the target's first (left-most) [[harm]] box; recover from other harm 50% faster for 24 hours. |
|2&nbsp;(Moderate) |Clear the target's first two [[harm]] boxes; recover from other harm 100% faster for 24 hours. |
|3 (High) |Clear the target's first three [[harm]] boxes; recover from other harm 150% faster for 24 hours. |

...And so on. Note that magical healing only affects specific harm boxes. Low-impact magical healing can only clear the target's first box; if other harm boxes are filled, they are out of reach of the effect. This means players should fill their left-most harm boxes first so that they can be quickly restored by magical healing.
