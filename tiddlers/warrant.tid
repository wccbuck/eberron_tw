In civilized [[Khorvaire]], the city guard, militia, constabulary, and all others charged with keeping the peace have the power to detain those they suspect of wrongdoing. However, this power is somewhat diminished if the suspect is a member of a royal family or a [[dragonmarked house]], or is sufficiently wealthy. This is especially a problem for rural officials and deputized citizens, whose authority could be questioned. A warrant is an official document stating that the bearer has the authority to arrest a specific individual or impound a specific item. A warrant includes identifying details of the person or item it covers, the reason it was issued, the signature of the local lord or magistrate, plus both a [[Sivis]] [[arcane mark]] and a wax or printed seal.
