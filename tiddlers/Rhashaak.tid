type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Rhashaak is an ancient [[black dragon]] and guardian of the wards that bind the [[overlord]] [[Masvirik]], in its prison in [[Haka'torvhak]]. Although he remains bound to that duty, he has been corrupted by his task, and serves as the [[voice|prakhutu]] of the archfiend. Today, dragon magic keeps the presence beneath the volcano quiet, but
Haka'torvhak is home to lesser [[fiend]]s that are subject
to Rhashaakâ€™s will.

The [[Poison Dusk]] has worshiped Rhashaak for millennia.
