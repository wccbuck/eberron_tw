        "text": "Queen Etrigani met her husband [[Kaius III|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] of [[Karrnath]] when she appeared before his court on behalf of the [[Sibling Kings]] of [[Aerenal]] during a diplomatic tour of the [[Five Nations]]. An intense courtship followed, and the two were married in 993 YK, on the second anniversary of Kaius's ascension to the throne. The queen has taken an active interest in the affairs of her adopted nation, and alongside Lady [[Moranna|Moranna ir'Wynarn]], performs most of the daily tasks of governing. She also acts as an emissary to foreign lands, since [[Kaius|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] rarely travels and almost never goes beyond his kingdom's borders. She is about 150 years old.\n\nEtrigani deeply loves [[Kaius|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]], and perhaps her work for the betterment of [[Karrnath]] is rooted purely in that love. But her true motives are a mystery. As one possibility, she may be part of the [[Deathguard]] of [[Aerenal]], and might have been instrumental in helping the nation break free from the [[Emerald Claw]] and the machinations of [[Lady Illmarrow]] in the 970's; now she is part of a long-term operation to locate Illmarrow's phylactery and eliminate her once and for all.",
