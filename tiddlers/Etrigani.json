An intense courtship followed, and the two were married in 993 YK, on the second anniversary of Kaius's ascension to the throne. The queen has taken an active interest in the affairs of her adopted nation, and alongside Lady [[Moranna|Moranna ir'Wynarn]], performs most of the daily tasks of governing. She also acts as an emissary to foreign lands, since [[Kaius|Kaius ir'Wynarn III]] rarely travels and almost never goes beyond his kingdom's borders.",
