title: levibubble gum
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This delicious gum comes in packs of 5 and can be blown into large, levitating bubbles 1 foot in diameter. You need to chew a piece of this gum for 1 minute before its magic can be used. Once it's been chewed for at least 1 minute, you can blow a single bubble with it. As long as you are still holding onto this bubble, you are under the effects of the [[levitate]] spell. You can also blow this bubble, remove it from your mouth, and attempt to stick it to another creature or object. The effect ends after 10 minutes, or early if the bubble takes any damage, allowing whatever it's attached to to gently float down to the ground if it's still afloat. The gum becomes nonmagical, albeit still delicious, once this bubble's effect ends.
