title: long corn
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This magical plant is one of the primary crops cultivated by settlers of [[Xen'drik]]. Long corn is imbued with supernatural qualities that slow its natural decomposition. Along with [[gurk'ash]] meat, it is the primary component of rations that never spoil, a boon for long voyages.
