Kalaashâ€™aarna is an independent [[inquisitive]] who runs a licensed agency called [[Information Acquisition]] in [[Underlook]], [[Sharn]]. He is part of the [['Aarna]] clan, which is a branch of the [['Aashta]] clan. 

Kalaash is a ruthless character who specializes in digging up dirt on behalf of corrupt politicians. He could cross paths with a party of player characters in a number of ways. One of the enemies of the party could hire Kalaash to track them down or spy on them. Alternatively, Kalaash could have come across interesting information during an investigation that he might be willing to share with the PCs for a price.
