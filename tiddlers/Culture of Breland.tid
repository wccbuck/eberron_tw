title: Culture of Breland
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The people of [[Breland]] have a strong tradition of independence and free thought. They are fiercely loyal to the kingdom and to the Brelish [[crown|Boranel ir'Wynarn]], but
at the same time they don’t want the law interfering with their daily lives. The Brelish are known for speaking their minds, and while they treat aristocrats and officers with the respect due to rank, they still consider themselves to be the equal of any other person. While the Brelish expect their voices to be heard, they also take the time to listen to others, and they are known for their tolerance. There is also a strong strain of skeptical pragmatism in the Brelish character; the Brelish always try to find the catch in every deal, question what others take on faith, and look for a personal advantage in any situation. This attitude has its dark side, and the major cities of Breland have some of the
highest crime rates in [[Khorvaire]].

Brelish tend to be loud, boisterous, and easygoing. They enjoy more personal rights and freedoms than seen anywhere else on the continent, and they carry an attitude that suggests they know this. They tend to be confident, liberal, and tolerant of others. Nothing seems to surprise or faze the Brelish. They love to engage in debate, especially regarding politics, though they enjoy conversations of all types. They have a rather special love of gossip, which is why the [[Sharn Inquisitive]] has such a strong readership throughout [[Breland]], but usually fares poorly beyond the Brelish borders, where it is seen as light and inconsequential.

!! Fashion

Brelish fashions tend to be simple and comfortable. Because of the heat, the Brelish prefer lighter fabrics and open, airy designs in casual dress. It is quite rare for Brelish clothes to cover the shoulders, and women often wear detached sleeves to keep their shoulders bare. The Brelish hate to be confined by rules, and aside from the demands of the weather, they follow few standards in dress. They do have one rule, however—cloth dyed with //sayda//. This rich sky-blue dye is made from shellfish found only in waters of the [[Dagger River]] near the Hilt. Sayda has become synonymous with Brelish national pride, making it more commonly known as “Brelish blue.” Natives of [[Breland]] traveling abroad make a point of always including at least a splash of Brelish blue in their clothes (unless traveling incognito). When the Brelish dress up, they are as likely to wear more elaborate versions of their normal garb as to adopt styles from across [[Khorvaire]]; there have even been times when [[Darguun]] [[hobgoblin]] clothing has been in vogue in cosmopolitan [[Sharn]].

Jewelry is common, even among the lower classes, with copper wire being used for many everyday adornments. Anklets and particularly armbands are the most common, although any sort of jewelry can be found among the wealthy.

!!! Armor

The Brelish are pragmatic people with no great desire to stand out on the battlefield. Thanks to their superior industrial capacity, they were able to field more soldiers in "medium" [[armor]] than their rivals during the [[Last War]]; and due to mass production, Brelish soldiers have nearly identical equipment. Brelish soldiers add personal touches, to be sure, but these are more related to comfort and functionality than to [[Aundair]]ian flair.

!! Cuisine

Brelish cooking utilizes meats, vegetables, and hearty sauces to create filling and comforting meals. Northern Brelish cuisine tends to be simpler fare, with a sweet and savory flavor. This is the food of farmers, designed to satisfy even the most ravenous appetites before and after a day of work in the fields. Here one can find beef boranel, a favorite of the [[king|Boranel ir'Wynarn]], that features a bread and mushroom stuffing roasted inside a full side of beef. Other hearty meals from the northern and central regions of Breland include borry spuds (fully loaded baked potatoes), farmer’s stew, thrice-poached eggs and sizzling pheasant, and kettle fried spider and redeye berries. 

Southern Brelish cooking is more adventurous, utilizing the spices and vegetables that grow in the more tropical clime. Food with a lot of heat dominates the menu, as do meals influenced by the diverse population of [[Sharn]] and then transported into the rest of the countryside. 

Traditional southern Brelish cooking is spicy and flavorful, and often too hot for those used to simpler fare. Fire-wrapped golden fish, spiced pork and orange peppers, and hot-spiced chicken in panya leaves are considered high cuisine in the best inns and restaurants throughout [[Breland]].

[[Sharn]] fusion, meanwhile, is a culinary experiment in combining traditional Brelish cooking with the exotic cuisine of the diverse people that regularly pass through or settle in the City of Towers. Taking ingredients and cooking styles from all over Khorvaire, the master chefs of Sharn combine these exotic dishes with their native presentation to make a totally new form of cuisine. Bold and exciting, Sharn fusion isn’t for everyone. But for those willing to try something new and a little different, this exotic culinary experience is worth the effort and expense (Sharn fusion tends to cost more than a traditional Brelish meal).

!! Religion

The Brelish have their share of priests and faithful. But [[religion]] is a private matter to most Brelish, not something to be shared or, worse, pushed upon others. Though tolerant and understanding of all things different, the Brelish have a tendency to show stronger emotions regarding king, country, and tangible things. “Gods and religion are all well and good,” [[Beggar Dane]] has written, “but get back to me when you see [[Dol Arrah]] walking the streets of [[Sharn]].”

The exception to the characteristic Brelish religious skepticism is [[Starilaskur]], the third largest city in [[Breland]], which is home to the [[Martial Temple of Dol Arrah]].
