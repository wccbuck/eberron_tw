Syla Syrralan d'[[Sivis]] is a gifted [[artificer]] who labors in the arcane workshops of the [[Ninth College]]. As part of her studies, she has spent a fortune crafting inks from the blood of rare and deadly [[aberration]]s. She has a great interest in the [[Draconic Prophecy]], and has become convinced that vital clues to understanding it can be revealed by the manner in which the [[kobold]]s of the [[Seawall Mountains]] use the [[Draconic]] language. Unfortunately, most kobolds have no great love for the [[gnome]]s of [[Zilargo]], and Syla is often looking for adventurers to protect her as she ventures into the depths to debate with scaled mystics.
