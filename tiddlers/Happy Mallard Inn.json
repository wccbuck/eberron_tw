It is a favorite haunt of the town reeve, [[Joherra]], who often conducts town business in the common room.\n\nThe Happy Mallard is owned by Onneth, an older [[half-elf]] man nearing retirement. Onneth is a good-hearted soul, but he is fretful, forgetful, and somewhat incompetent.\n\n!! During the [[Reavers of Harkenwold|The Reavers of Harkenwold]] Adventure\n\nOnneth also can't keep a secret. So, leaders in the resistance against the [[Iron Circle]] are careful about what they say around the old innkeep.",
