Demons are the embodiment of chaos and evilâ€”engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, these [[fiend]]s exist only to destroy. 

Most demons are immune to all forms of poison and disease (though they may appear diseased, and can certainly spread contagion), and possess [[blindsight]] and/or [[darkvision]].

While many demons are children of [[Khyber]], native to the [[demiplane]]s, they can also be found in [[Fernia]], [[Dolurrh]], [[Shavarath]], and other [[plane]]s, representing some destructive or savage aspect of those planes.
