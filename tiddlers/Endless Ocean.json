It's home\nto a vast array of fish and aquatic [[beast]]s, along with [[merfolk]]\ntribes and a wide range of water [[elemental]]s, from simple\nsentient currents to massive [[leviathan]]s and battling\nmegafauna. The Endless Ocean is where the [[gnome]] [[Tasker|Tasker Torralyn d'Sivis]]\nencountered an island that turned out to be a totem turtle. True\nislands are few and far between, and most are actually portals\nto other layers of Lamannia. There are many points in the\nEndless Ocean tied to [[manifest zone]]s (most located in ocean\ndepths) in the Material Plane.",
