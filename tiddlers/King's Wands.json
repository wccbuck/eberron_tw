Led by Captain Nebik, a [[gnome]] [[wizard]], the Wands provide magical support and undertake missions that require arcane talents. The agents of the Wands usually work as part of a task force that includes operatives from other divisions of the Citadel. However, their most significant work isn't in the field, but rather in the workshop. The King's Wands bring together the finest Brelish minds in arcane science, working to develop magical weapons, defenses, rituals, and more. \n\nThe squad of King's Wands in [[Sharn]] is led by [[Zaira Dane]].",
