If you are a wizard, you have a spellbook filled with arcane minutia and mysteries. If you are a [[warlock]], you have formed a pact with a powerful [[immortal]] who has granted you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. 

With this book of ancient secrets in hand, you may cast any [[common-tier|spell tier]] spell you know with [[advantage]] and without expending [[stress]], as long as you spend over an hour preparing and performing the ritual.

In addition, gain two [[common-tier|spell tier]] spells that you can ''only'' cast as one-hour rituals as described above.
