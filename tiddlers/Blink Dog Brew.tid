Blink Dog Brew (named after the House [[Ghallanda]] emblem beast, the [[blink dog]]), is an ale that can be found at any [[Gold Dragon Inn]] and any tavern licensed by the [[Hostelers Guild]] in [[Khorvaire]] and beyond. Those with refined palates may sneer at you for drinking Blink Dog, but it's cheap, reliable, and universally available. Guild-licensed taverns also often carry Swordtooth Ale, which is higher quality.
