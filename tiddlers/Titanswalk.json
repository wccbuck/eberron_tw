Local historians theorize that the gatehouse, called the Titanswalk (or simply the Walk\nto locals), was once the site of pomp-filled processionals during the [[Age of Giants]].\nThe statues themselves are awe inspiring, rising just high\nenough for their heads to be glimpsed over the high silver\nwalls. Each of the seven statues is believed to represent a\nsignificant figure in the history of the [[giant]]s, though not\neven giant historians know the figuresâ€™ names.",
