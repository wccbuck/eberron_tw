Eld’s family has served in the [[King's Citadel]] for generations, and for the most part he is simply following tradition; he has little ambition and usually waits for the [[Knight-Marshal|Banarak Tithon]] or [[Talleon|Talleon Haliar Tonan]] to provide him with orders. He has sixteen soldiers under his command.",
