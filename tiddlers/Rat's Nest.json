The customers of the Rat's Nest are more inclined to gossip than to\nviolence; the [[shifter]]s of [[Northedge]] are as industrious\nand honest as any other citizen of the ward. However,\nthe presence of [[Fathen's Shrine|Shrine of Fathen the Martyr]] hangs over the tavern\nlike a shadow, and the regulars have an unfriendly\nattitude toward any follower of the [[Silver Flame]]. \n\nShifters gain an [[advantage]] when gathering information in the Rat's Nest.",
