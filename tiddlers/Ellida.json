        "text": "The last time [[Thelanis]] was coterminous with the Material Plane, a faerie queen and her retinue passed through a [[manifest zone]] portal to [[Xen'drik]]. Transfixed by the wild beauty of the mysterious continent, the queen chose to stay for a time and enjoy this new place.\n\nEllida the [[nymph]] queen is an achingly lovely woman with silver hair like moonlight on water, eyes the color of violets, and lips the shade of ripe cherries. She cherishes beauty above all else, and handsome mortals especially fascinate her. Those who swish to gain her favor present her with pretty baubles and elegant trinkets. Ellida is flighty and selfish in the manner of most [[fey]], but she has a sweet disposition, and her court is infatuated with her.\n\nTioboid the [[satyr]] is Ellida's champion, and devotes himself to his queen's defense. Two other satyrs and a company of grasshopper-like [[pixie]]s make up the rest of the court.",
