This simple axe looks no different from a standard forester's tool. A single-edged head is set into a slot in the haft and bound with strong cord. The axe was found by a timber-hauling crew who disappeared into the shadows of a cave deep in an old forest. Retrieved in the dark of the cave, the axe was found to possess disturbing magical properties.

This weapon deals extra [[necrotic damage|damage type]] to anything it hits. Gain +2 [[impact]] when you strike a [[plant creature]] with the axe. While you carry this axe, you may cast [[darkness]] once per day.
