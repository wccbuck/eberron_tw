This simple axe looks no different from a standard forester's tool. A single-edged head is set into a slot in the haft and bound with strong cord. The axe was found by a timber-hauling crew who disappeared into the shadows of a cave deep in an old forest. Retrieved in the dark of the cave, the axe was found to possess disturbing magical properties.

This weapon deals extra necrotic damage to anything it hits. When you hit a [[plant creature]] with it, the target takes double damage. While you carry this axe, you may cast [[darkness]] once per day.
