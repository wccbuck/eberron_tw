''Population:'' <<ntls>>

With buildings surrounding the Galethspyre, a narrow
sliver of blue stone jutting up over 600 feet from the bank
of the [[Dagger River]], this large town is a major hub for barges
and ferries landing on the west bank of the mighty river.
Ferries run to [[Wroat]] on the other side of the Dagger
River four times a day. The dock area is always bustling
with activity, even at night, as Citadel agents check all
goods going into Wroat at Galethspyre before issuing
a permit to sail on the [[Howling River]].

Galethspyre specializes in textiles, with both bolts
of cloth and finished garments filling the marketplace.
The town is also home to the nation’s largest dyer.
The distinctive “[[Breland]] Blue” dye seen throughout
the country is crafted here in huge copper cauldrons.
The smell can be overwhelming for the new visitor,
as boiling dyes reek of fish, herbs, and rare earths.
The town also has several major lumberyards; timber
cutters at [[Woodhelm]] lash together rafts of logs and
ride them down the river to Galethspyre to be milled
or carved.

House [[Deneith]] maintains a large [[Defenders Guild]]
enclave in Galethspyre, because the town is a major
staging area for caravans journeying into [[Droaam]].
The town also boasts an enormous outdoor amphitheater, and House [[Phiarlan]] promotes grand festivals three times a year as the [[Artisans Guild|Entertainers and Artisans Guild]] fills the streets
with song and color. These festivals have become a
large enough part of [[Breland]]’s social calendar that
thousands make the short journey from [[Wroat]] to
attend, with more spectators coming from [[Sharn]] or
even as far away as [[Starilaskur]].
