Shudra, the Fleshrender, is a [[rakshasa]] and chosen servant of the [[overlord]] [[Dhavibashta]], who is bound beneath the ruins of [[Mel-Aqat]] in [[Xen'drik]]. Shudra was the original wielder of the Sunderer, a weapon today known as the [[Ramethene Sword]], and used it during the [[Age of Demons]] to fell many great [[dragon]]s.
