Originally part of the [[Arcane Order of Aureon]], they were split from the main order in 312 YK and charged with maintaining the mystic defenses of the [[Arcane Congress]]â€”and in replicating the abilities of the [[Mark of Warding]]. It was [[wizard]]s of the Golden Seal who first perfected the common [[glyph of warding]] spells used in the [[Five Nations]]. While small, this is an elite order whose members gained considerable prestige during the [[Last War]].",
