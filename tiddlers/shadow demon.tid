Shadow [[demon]]s all but disappear in the darkness, and they can creep about without making a sound. A shadow demon uses its insubstantial claws to feast on its victim's fears, to taste its memories, and drink in its doubts. Bright light harries this [[fiend]] and shows its distinct shape, resolving it from a blur of darkness to a winged [[humanoid]] creature whose lower body trails off into nothing, and whose claws rend a victim's mind.
