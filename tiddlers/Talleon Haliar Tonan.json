        "text": "Most of the members of the [[King's Citadel]] in [[Sharn]]\nare part of the [[King's Dark Lanterns]], the intelligence division of the Citadel. While [[Banarak Tithon]] oversees all Citadel operations in Sharn, the Dark\nLanterns are under the direct command of Captain Talleon Haliar Tonan. Talleon is devoted to the preservation of [[Breland]] and to the [[King|Boranel ir'Wynarn]], but he\nis utterly ruthless, and authorizes torture, theft, and assassination if a mission requires it. He has built up a network of [[Lower City|lower ward]] contacts, and has\nengaged in “friendly deals” with the [[Tyrants]], the\n[[Boromar Clan]], and even House [[Tarkanan]]. Talleon\ndoesn’t care about crime; he wants to expose and\neliminate foreign spies, saboteurs, or other threats\nto the kingdom. He is also interested in increasing his own personal authority; the more power he has, the more effectively he can do his job. If\nTalleon ever gets a chance to take command from\nKnight-Marshal [[Banarak|Banarak Tithon]], he will seize it. Until\nthen, he continues to form strategic alliances with\nguilds and power groups throughout the city. \n\nTalleon may approach the party for assistance with a\nproblem, but he is more likely to use blackmail to control the PCs instead of offering a reward—assuming that they won’t simply cooperate with the [[Citadel|King's Citadel]] to serve the needs of the kingdom.",
