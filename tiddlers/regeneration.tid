You touch a creature and accelerate its natural healing ability. For up to 1 hour, the target's physical wounds heal extremely rapidly. Any severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.
