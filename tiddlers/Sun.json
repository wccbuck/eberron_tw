They created the sun, Arrah, much as mortals might kindle a campfire. This fire remained even after their battle, and continues to provide light, heat, and comfort to the world.\n\nJust as the [[moon]]s of [[Eberron]] each have a connection to one of the [[plane]]s of existence, the Sun represents the Material Plane. It was the first object created in the Material Plane, and is the anchor from which reality radiates. \n\nIn the [[Sovereign Host]], [[Dol Arrah]] is the Sovereign of Sun and Sacrifice; her name is, essentially, “The Warrior Sun.”\n\n!! The Power of Sunlight\n\nLike [[Irian]], the sun also radiates positive energy that can harm or debilitate many kinds of [[Mabar]]an [[undead]] (such as [[vampire]]s and [[wraith]]s) by disrupting the negative energy that sustains them.\n\nThe power of sunlight can be captured in various [[magic item]]s. The most powerful such artifact is a globe of light known as the Summer Sun at the top of the [[feyspire]] [[Pylas Pyrial]].\n\n",
