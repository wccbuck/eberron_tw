        "text": "In the Progenitor Myth, the three [[Progenitor Dragons]] rested in the Material Plane after creating the [[plane]]s. They created the sun, Arrah, much as mortals might kindle a campfire. This fire remained even after their battle, and continues to provide light, heat, and comfort to the world. Like [[Irian]], the sun also radiates positive energy that can harm or debilitate many kinds of [[Mabar]]an [[undead]] (such as [[vampire]]s and [[wraith]]s) by disrupting the negative energy that sustains them.\n\nThe power of sunlight can be captured in various [[magic item]]s. The most powerful such artifact is a globe of light known as the Summer Sun at the top of the [[feyspire]] [[Pylas Pyrial]].\n\nIn the [[Sovereign Host]], [[Dol Arrah]] is the Sovereign of Sun and Sacrifice; her name is, essentially, “The Warrior Sun.”",
