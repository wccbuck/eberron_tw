Bethageh, also known as the Slug Lord, the Glistening Tyrant, the Dripping Dread, and other epithets, is a slug-like [[pit fiend]] worshiped by some [[cultists of the Dragon Below|Cults of the Dragon Below]], including those among the leadership of the [[Iron Circle]] mercenary band.

Through infernal pacts, [[warlock]]s can entreat Bethageh for great power, including the ability to summon [[tar devil]]s, horned humanoid soldiers who drip scalding black pitch from their skin. 

Bethageh is a [[fiend]] of [[Eldrantulku]], the Oathbreaker. It is one of the three "claws," or main servants, of the [[overlord]]'s [[speaker|prakhutu]] [[Neabaz]], and thus has a permanent psychic connection to the Herald of Lies. Despite its disgusting appearance, the Slug Lord inspires fierce loyalty in its followers. It is also dangerously cunning and calculating, and often schemes against its master and the other claws.
