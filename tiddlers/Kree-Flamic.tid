The people of [[Thrane]] embrace the tenets of the [[Silver Flame]] in all of their forms of expression. From fine art
to sculpture, the most popular artistic style remains
Kree-Flamic, a stylized form of rendering that uses
cubes and triangles to create all shapes and images.
Jesp Kree pioneered the style over 600 years ago; he served as the Church
Art Master for [[Keeper|Keeper of the Flame]] Traelyn Ghelios and helped
establish the principles of the Flamic style. From
stained glass in the great cathedrals that present stylized images of great moments in the faithâ€™s history to
the three-sided, stained-glass flame boxes found in the
homes of many followers of the [[Silver Flame]], almost
all Flamic-style art pays homage to the Church and its
significant figures.
