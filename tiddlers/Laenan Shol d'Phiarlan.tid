The [[Sylvan|Sylvan (theater)]] theater in [[Sylbaran]] is run by Laenan Shol d'[[Phiarlan]], an accomplished actor who is particularly fascinated with the [[Greensingers]] and the [[fey]] knack for [[enchantment]] and [[illusion]]. While [[Stillwater]] has never come to the Sylvan, Laenan has convinced a number of Greensinger initiates to perform there.
