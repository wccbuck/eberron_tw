This frosty armor is enchanted to keep its wearer at a constant, comfortable temperature. While wearing this armor, you have resistance to extreme cold and heat, and have no trouble walking through thick snow or over slippery ice. In addition, while wearing the armor, you can cast the [[ice storm]] spell from it, centered on your location. When you cast the spell in this way, you are immune to its effects. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
