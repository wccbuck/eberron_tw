Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within 90 feet for up to 1 minute.

When a creature enters or spends a few seconds inside the affected area, they must dodge the tentacles or else be struck and restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends or until they fight their way out.
