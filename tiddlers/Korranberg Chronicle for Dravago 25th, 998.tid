!! Shipwrecks May Mark Pirate Escalation

[[TROLANPORT|Trolanport]]—The //Lucky Larkspur// washed ashore on the [[Zilargo]] coast last week. The bodies of its crew had been mutilated almost beyond recognition, and its cargo was missing. The //Lucky Larkspur// is the third ship to suffer such a fate in the last two months, and port officials speculate that a new band of pirates may be responsible.

"Pirates revel in the fear they cause, but this sort of ritualistic murder goes far beyond the pale. These pirates, whoever they may be, are by far the most bloodthirsty madmen I've ever come across," said Parlo Garrelspan, the [[Trolanport]] harbor administrator. Garrelspan asserted that most of the merchant ships plying the [[Thunder Sea]] are hiring extra marines to guard their vessels against the pirates. Thus far, the marauders have left no survivors, and no calling card other than the dismembered bodies of the crew.

"While this new band of pirates is bloodier than others, they represent only a new incident in a worrisome trend," said Garrelspan. "We've seen a real influx of pirates on the [[Thunder Sea]] recently. The conclusion of the [[Last War]] left too many war-trained sailors and not enough peacetime ships for them to crew. Unfortunately, a lot of them turned to piracy."

Thus far, all the stricken ships have been owned by smaller merchant companies, but House [[Lyrandar]] and the navies of both [[Breland]] and [[Zilargo]] are taking the matter quite seriously. A House Lyrandar captain, however, speculated that pirates might not be to blame. "The [[sahuagin]] dwelling in the [[Straits of Shargon]] have some appalling sacrificial rites," Captain Derenver d'Lyrandar said. "If a sahuagin tribe has migrated into a shipping lane, its members could easily produce this sort of damage."

"I know what the [[gnome]]s think," d'Lyrandar continued, "but pirates are too smart to just butcher everyone. They want their victims scared enough to surrender, not so certain of their impending doom that they're willing to fight to the death."

!! Breland Apologizes for Arrest of Orien Scion

[[VATHIROND|Vathirond]]—General Jorekk Blandra, commander of the [[King's Shields]] 4th Border Army, apologized on Sar for the day-long detention of a high-ranking member of House [[Orien]] traveling to [[Sharn]] on House business.

“In our zeal to protect the borders of this fair nation from interlopers and criminals, we misinterpreted some sensitive intelligence,” he said in a written statement issued from the army’s keep northwest of the city. “Our sincerest apologies go out to Jarla d’Orien and members of her entourage for the delay.”

Jarla d’Orien oversees the house’s caravan operations throughout western [[Khorvaire]]. Her detention in [[Vathirond]] last week brought a swift response from House [[Orien]], which briefly suspended [[lightning rail]] service to [[Breland]] destinations in response to the arrest. She was freed last Sul.

General Blandra’s statement did not mention the specific charges that resulted in d’Orien’s arrest, nor the nature of the intelligence that his staff misinterpreted. Staff officers of the King’s Shields 4th said the general was traveling back to [[Wroat]] and unavailable for further comment.

!! Orien Offers Bounty on Lightning Rail Raiders

[[VULYAR|Vulyar]], [[KARRNATH|Karrnath]]—House [[Orien]] has announced a bounty of [[500 crowns|money]] on a gang that has been sabotaging [[lightning rail]] service between the [[Karrnath]]i cities of [[Vulyar]] and [[Irontown]]. The gang, known by the "Three Fingers" moniker, has robbed the lightning rail three times in the last six months, eluding House [[Orien]] guards each time.

Three weeks ago, House Orien blamed the Three Fingers gang for the temporary suspension of rail traffic between [[Vulyar]] and [[Irontown]]. The shutdown lasted for three days, then additional delays extended it for two days beyond that.

Citing security concerns, the leaders of House Orien refused to discuss the exact reason for the shutdown. But a villager in [[Yellow Pass]], a hamlet near the rail route, stated that a [[lightning rail]] carrying ingots from the [[Mror Holds]] derailed after dozens of [[conductor stone]]s were removed from its path. "The officials grabbed every horse and every able-bodied worker in Yellow Pass to help with the cleanup," said the villager, who asked that his name not be used. "Several rail cars were tipped over, and some of them were still on fire, but no ingots remained as far as I could tell."

The villager refused to speculate on how the ingots might have been removed. "If it took dozens of horses and a second lightning rail to haul off the wreck," he said, "I don't know how the Three Fingers could have gotten items as heavy as ingots away from the wreckage."

The bounty should substantially improve the chances of bringing the perpetrators to justice. If would-be bounty hunters don't capture the gang, one of the national armies or [[dragonmarked house]]s still might. [[Karrnath]] has dispatched extra patrols, including the [[Adamant Fang]] order, into the area to search for the raiders.

In addition, several [[dwarf]] [[clan|Mror clan]]s within the [[Mror Holds]] are negotiating with [[Korth]] to provide pursuit parties. "That [[lightning rail]] line is our primary connection to the rest of [[Khorvaire]], and we take threats against it as threats against the holds themselves," said Baron Juri Deepspring of Mror.

Meanwhile, House [[Deneith]] has offered the services of its [[Sentinel Marshals]] to protect the rail line. House [[Orien]] officials have assured the public that the [[lightning rail]]s running the Vulyar-Irontown route now have "unparalleled security."
