But some within\nthe house are still bitter about Haruuc\u2019s\ninsurrection; the [[enclave]] in Darguun is\na tense place to do business.\n\nThis fortress [[enclave]] sits just outside the city of [[Rhukaan Draal]], and serves as a staging area for [[goblin]] mercenaries who wish to work\nfor the house. It provides a stable and secure haven for\ntravelers passing through the region, provided you're on\ngood terms with House Deneith. Many [[Blademarks|Blademarks Guild]] receive their initial training in large-unit tactics here.\n\nThis fortress is one of two parts of the [[Rhukaan Draal]] enclave. The other is a diplomatic stronghold within Rhukaan Draal called Fort Cail, named after Lord Cail d\u2019Deneith, who first recruited goblins to fight under the Deneith banner more than a century ago.\n\nThe Gathering Stone has been considered a holy site by the [[Kurmaac]] [[druid]]s for thousands of years.", "modified": "20210727192009808", "tags": "Darguun fortress enclave Deneith", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "article": "the ", "category": "location", "color": "#A3DB62", "points": "27.997,1.15", "style": "{\"color\": \"#732873\"}"}
