title: oil of shadow armor
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This metallic oil can cover a human-sized or smaller creature, and takes 10 minutes to apply. The affected creature appears to be wearing ornate plate armor, though this armor is only semi-real and provides protection equivalent to that of leather armor (as the spell [[mage armor]]). The effect lasts for 1 hour.
