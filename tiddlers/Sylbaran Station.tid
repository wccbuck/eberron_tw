The [[Wardens of the Wood]] have refused to allow House [[Orien]] to extend the [[lightning rail]] into [[Sylbaran]], but they allow the [[house|dragonmarked house]] to maintain the [[trade road|Orien trade roads]] and run caravans and long coaches through the town. Sylbaran Station is built to support this traffic and to store freight being transferred to or from these caravans; the [[enclave]] is surrounded by silos and warehouses. Station manager [[Husker d'Orien]] dreams of seeing the lightning rail in Sylbaran, and is constantly working to win the favor of members of the town council.
