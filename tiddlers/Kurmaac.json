        "text": "Thousands of years ago, the Empire of [[Dhakaan]] was shattered by the [[daelkyr]]. In the end, it was the [[orc]] [[Gatekeepers]]—[[druid]]s considered to be superstitious savages by the Dhakaani—who brought an end to the [[Xoriat]] incursion. As the crippled kingdom collapsed into chaos, a new tradition arose among the [[goblinoid]]s: the druidic path of the Kurmaac. Although inspired by the orc mystics, the Kurmaac were also influenced by the [[daelkyr]] and their creations, intertwining lessons from the [[Realm of Revelations|Xoriat]] with the [[primal power|primal magic]] and [[beast spirits|fey]] of the Material Plane.\n\nFor millennia, the [[Gathering Stone]] remained under the guardianship of the Kurmaac druids. They were slain and scattered during the raids of [[Malleon the Reaver]], but maintain their traditions and practices to this day, and still consider the Gathering Stone to be a holy site.",
