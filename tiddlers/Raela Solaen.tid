The story of the Queen of the Burning Sky is still told in parts of [[Breland]] even though she predates their nation. Raela Solaen was an [[Aereni]] [[wizard]] who opposed the [[Undying Court]] during the destruction of the line of [[Vol]] and chose exile rather than death. Making her way west, she married [[Breggor Firstking]] of [[Wroat]]. Her arcane might was a key element of Breggor’s success; in the tales of Breggor’s siege of Shaarat (before it was known as [[Sharn]]), Solaen devastated the defenders with massive waves of fire. 

These stories may be exaggerated; Raela may have just been using the equivalent of [[fireball]]s and [[flaming sphere]]s. On the other hand, it’s possible that the Queen of the Burning Sky developed unique war rituals—spells that inflicted less damage than a fireball, but with a far greater range and area of effect. As she had no interest in sharing her knowledge with others, her secrets died with her. But if Solaen’s [[spellshard]]s were found today, her war rituals might be a boon to the nation that obtained them.
