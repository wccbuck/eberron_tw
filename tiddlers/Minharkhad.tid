Minharkhad, an [[Inspired]] [[psi warrior]], is the commander of the guard at the [[Riedra]] [[Embassy|Riedra Embassy (Sharn)]] in [[Sharn]]. The embassy guard is comprised of 12 highly trained [[human]] soldiers. To date, the embassy guard has never been called into service, so the people of Sharn know nothing about the extent of their skills. Minharkhad himself is cold and cruel. Unlike [[Helkashtai]] and [[Jorasesh]], Minharkhad has trouble concealing his disdain for humanity, and as a result he is rarely seen outside of the embassy.
