The [[greatwyrm]]s of the Thousand inhabit\nlairs hewn in the [[Age of Demons]], and the cries of soaring dragons fill the air. Dragons have lived here for tens of thousands of years; the territory is replete with monuments to wise wyrms and legendary prophets, shrines to the [[deities|Dragon Gods]] of [[Thir]], and wondrous locations created by the greatest [[flames of the forge|flame of the forge]]. Crafted through pure magic by colossal artisans, these edifices tower over the landscape. Flying across the Thousand is a breathtaking experience, but one few nondragons ever experience; intruders find scant welcome in the land of the Thousand.\n\n!!

Industries\n\nSome [[dragon]]s of the Thousand trade with the dominion lords of the [[Vast]], bartering for servants or treasures produced in that land. [[Flames of the forge|flame of the forge]] wander the land, using their skills as architects, [[artificer]]s, and\nengineers in exchange for treasures or useful information. Beyond this, the dragons are self-sufficient and self-involved; few real industries exist within the Thousand.\n\n!! Life and Society\n\nThe [[dragon]]s of the Thousand are organized into extended family groups known as flights. Each flight controls a large domain within the Thousand. Every adult dragon has their own lair, which they share with their mate and children. Some flights spread out across their domain, with miles between lairs. Others prefer to live in close proximity. These flights use [[epic-tier|spell tier]] magic to draw vast pillars of volcanic rock up from the earth, and then carve tunnels into these massive monoliths; a single pillar can be over a mile in height, serving as a home for up to a dozen dragons.\n\nThe flights of the Thousand are grouped by color. Many flights are surrounded by neighbors of the same color, creating patchwork patterns across the land. Most dragons of the Thousand prefer the company of their own kind, and groups of aligned flights form distinct cultures. For example:\n\n* A [[magebreeding]] culture which created the [[bolatash]]i, and perhaps created many other species found across [[Eberron]].\n* A culture led by [[children of Eberron|child of Eberron]] that employs [[primal magic]]; this is the birthplace of [[Vvaraak]].\n* A culture that studies the [[plane]]s and [[demiplane]]s, and which created the [[planar orreries|orrery of the planes]] and [[planar observatories|planar observatory]].\n* A culture dedicated to the study of [[immortal]]s, who deal with [[elemental]]s and [[celestial]]s and are the foremost experts on the [[overlord]]s; many [[warlock]]s can be found among these flights.\n\nA few flights still cling to the antichromatic philosophies of [[Ourenilach]], and some tension arises between [[white dragon]]s and other flights, largely based around the argument that the less intelligent whites are little better than [[wyvern]]s. Although this can result in\nheated debate, violence between dragons is rare. Formal\nduels or staged battles are accepted by some flights as a\nway of settling disputes, but most insist that members go\nto the [[Vast]] if they intend to do battle. Crimes between\ndragons are handled by the servants of [[Lendys]], the\n[[Dragon God|Dragon Gods]] of Justice.\n\n!! Government and Politics\n\nWith a few exceptions, flights are ruled by the oldest [[dragon]] of the line. The clan might debate important issues, but the eldest has the final say. He decides who represents the flight in the [[Conclave]] of [[Argonnessen]], and who guards the great treasures of the flight. He appoints the servant of [[Lendys]], who investigates and punishes crimes committed by or against members of the flight; if necessary, a servant of Lendys can call upon the [[Eyes of Chronepsis]] for assistance. Beneath the elder, status within a flight is based on age and hoard.\n\nThe [[Conclave]] of [[Argonnessen]] is based in the Thousand. Dragons who speak in the Conclave are treated with great respect, regardless of their rank within a flight.\n\n!! Nondragons in the Thousand\n\nMost non[[dragon]]s in the Thousand are retainers attached to a particular flight of dragons. Some have served their flight for generations; others are recent acquisitions brought over from the [[Vast]]. Categories of nondragon retainers include:\n\n* ''Factory workers and custodians:'' While most menial labor in [[Argonnessen]] is accomplished or made trivial by the use of magic, certain tasks, such as the maintenance of arcane ley lines, require physical work. [[Humanoid|humanoid]]s are often dispatched for these jobs, especially with arcane systems or [[manifest zone]]s which have dangerous long-term effects on a [[dragon]]'s health—but a [[human]]'s natural lifespan is too short to be negatively affected.\n* ''Companions:'' Just as a humanoid keeps a small beast as a pet, some dragons keep humanoids. This could be a direct relationship, or more like the maintenance of a garden or an ant farm; the dragons remain aloof, but enjoy providing for and observing their humanoid community.\n* ''Valets:'' A role between a companion and a custodian, a valet is a respected servant with a direct relationship with a dragon or flight, and is dispatched for specific tasks. For example, a dragon sage may keep a group of humanoid [[magewright]]s in a [[planar observatory]], and task them with tracking specific signs.\n* ''Lab rats:'' Humanoids and [[giant]]s are sometimes used by flights of dragons in magical experiments. In some cases, new forms of [[arcane magic]] are aggressively tested on humanoid populations. In another experiment, a line of dragons studying [[divine magic]] may have invented a religion, and are testing whether their community of humanoids will eventually, over centuries, develop the ability to cast divine spells though their belief in this artificial faith.\n* ''Artwork:'' A nondragon community might serve as a palette for a dragon artist—something like a living poem, or concept given form. Such a society might be kept stagnant to preserve the artistic vision, or perhaps it's a short-term project, and the artist plans to clear their canvas and start again in a century or two.\n\nMany [[dragon]]s dislike the presence of nondragons. Some of these dragons use [[construct]]s as retainers, such as iron [[golem]]s. Others feel that nondragons have no place in [[Argonnessen]], and any such creature who crosses the domain of such a dragon is killed on sight. Nondragons have no rights in the Thousand. Killing a humanoid bearing the mark of a friendly flight is an insult to the owner, but many dragons consider the life of a single lesser creature to be trivial and pay this no mind.\n\n!! Important Sites\n\nThe Thousand is an enormous territory, filled with shrines, monuments, and magical locations. The land is studded with dragons’ lairs, and a dragon is almost always visible in the sky. Here are just a few of the important sites of the Thousand.\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[location]sort[title]]:filter[get[text]length[]compare:integer:gt[200]]\">>\n\n!! Adventure Seeds\n\nThe Thousand is a dangerous place for adventurers. Nondragons are often killed on sight, and the area has the highest concentration of dragons in [[Argonnessen]]. Of course, lots of dragons means lots of treasure... although stealing from a dragon of the Thousand likely incurs the wrath of the entire flight.\n\n''Seed of Vvaraak:'' After a deadly adventure, the PCs acquire a large golden seed, said to be one of the last treasures [[Vvaraak]] gave to the [[Gatekeepers]]. The seed radiates an overpowering aura of universal magic, but it will not bloom. A prophet tells them that the plant grows only if nourished with a handful of soil from the base of the [[Face of Eberron]]. Can the adventurers acquire this potent soil? And what will spring from the Seed of Vvaraak?\n\n''Looming Threat:'' The adventurers’ patron—a [[dragonmarked house]], the [[King's Citadel]], or a similar organization—believes that the dragons of [[Argonnessen]] are preparing to launch a devastating attack. The PCs must penetrate the [[Great Aerie]] and eavesdrop on the next session of the [[Conclave]]. If the rumor is true, are they bold enough to speak for [[Khorvaire]] and prevent devastation?",
