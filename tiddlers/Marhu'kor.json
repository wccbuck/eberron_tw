        "text": "According to the records of the [[Kech Volaar]], the Marhu'kor (//Crimson King// in [[Dhakaani]]) was a powerful [[red dragon]] who dominated a large region in central [[Khorvaire]] before the rise of the [[Dhakaani Empire|Dhakaan]]. His mountain lair was filled with countless treasures, a combination of tributes collected from subjugated peoples and artifacts of ancient times that he jealously hoardedâ€”artifacts from the [[Age of Demons]], relics of the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]]. This dragon is likely one and the same as //Jharaashta//, a legendary red dragon that features prominently in old [[Gaa'ran and Gaa'aram|orc]] folktales.\n\nThe great [[dirge singer]] [[Jhazaal Dhakaan]] negotiated a peace between the Marhu'kor and the young empire, at a considerable price. Jhazaal also convinced the dragon to surrender the horn that she later crafted into the artifact [[Ghaal'duur]].\n\nThe Marhu'kor hasn't been seen in over five millennia. He is almost certainly long dead of old age. Likewise, his lair was probably looted thousands of years ago, but hidden portions of his hoard could remain intact, holding artifacts of incalculable value.",
