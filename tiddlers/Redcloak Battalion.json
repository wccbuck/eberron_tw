        "text": "The soldiers of the Redcloak Battalion are among the deadliest warriors in [[Breland]]. When a situation calls for extreme military force, both the [[Sharn Watch]] and the\n[[King's Citadel]] turn to the Redcloak Battalion. This elite unit fought in the forefront of the [[Last War]], and the bards in [[Menthis|Menthis Plateau]] today sing of the exploits of [[Khandan the Hammer|Khandan Dol]] and Meira the Huntress. At the end of the war, the battalion was split up, and one unit was assigned to [[Sharn]]. Its [[headquarters|Talain Garrison]] is located in the [[Daggerwatch]] district of [[Upper Dura]], and is led by Captain [[Khandan Dol]].\n\nMany of the members of the Redcloak Battalion resent\nbeing relegated to mere law enforcement, and there is a strong rivalry between the Redcloaks and the [[King's Swords]] of the [[Citadel|King's Citadel]], who generally have less military experience even though they enjoy far greater authority and prestige.\n\nAs veterans and heroes of the Last War, many of the\nRedcloaks are unfriendly toward travelers from other\nnations. As far as the Redcloaks are concerned, the\n[[Treaty of Thronehold]] is merely an intermission, and\nsoon King [[Boranel|Boranel ir'Wynarn]] will come to his senses and finish\nthe job that [[Wroann ir'Wynarn]] began. \n\nThe Redcloaks are absolutely faithful to [[Breland]]: they are willing to lay\ndown their lives in the service of their nation. Trying\nto bribe a Redcloak is a good way to lose a hand.",
