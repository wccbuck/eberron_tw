        "text": "The Lucky Dragonshard Cardhouse is a massive casino located in the lower levels of [[Lyrandar Tower]]. The decor is exotic, with several rooms designed to evoke distant lands. One room, designed in a [[Xen'drik]] motif, has a mural of a vast jungle covering its walls, with a massive pyramid rising above the forest canopy. Another room is adorned with life-like statues of mighty [[hobgoblin]] warriors, and the murals on its walls reflect a [[Darguun]] theme.\n\nIn addition to [[Three-Dragon Ante]], [[Zilargo Darts]], and a variety of other games of chance, patrons of the Lucky Dragonshard can wager their money on boxing matches, which are held every weekend.\n\nThe Cardhouse also contains a small theater, which is most often used for illusionist dramas and exhibitions.\n\nThe owner of the Lucky Dragonshard is a wiry man named ''Rilfar Smas''.",
