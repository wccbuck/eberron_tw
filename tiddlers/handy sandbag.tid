title: handy sandbag
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This small leather pouch appears empty, though sifting sand can be heard from within when shaken. While holding the sandbag, you can turn over the pouch and cause up to 1 pound of sand to pour from it.

Once a total of 1 pound of sand has been produced, the
magic ceases to function until the next dawn.
