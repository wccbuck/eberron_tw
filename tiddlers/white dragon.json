        "text": "The smallest and most animalistic of the dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. Their bestial nature and mastery of their environments make them keen hunters.\n\nA white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.\n\n!! Magic and Breath Weapon\n\nThe white dragon can exhale a powerful icy blast. As innate spellcasters, adult white dragons can cast spells such as [[ice storm]], [[wall of ice]], and [[fog cloud]], but may generally be less magically gifted than other true dragons. \n\nA white dragon's magic can also manifest in other ways. For example, a white dragon can create clouds of freezing fog, or cause jagged ice shards to fall from the ceiling of their lair.\n\n!!! Regional Effects\n\nOld and powerful [[dragon]]s of all colors exert a magical influence over the land surrounding their lairs, spontaneously creating anomalies as far as 6 miles away. The dragon cannot control or suppress this effect; it is an arcanobiological phenomenon tied to the color of the dragon, and only gets more powerful with age.\n\nRegional effects of white dragons include a deepening cold, obscuring fog, freezing precipitation, and the spontaneous formation of icy walls.\n\n{{$:/DragonAgeCategories}}",
