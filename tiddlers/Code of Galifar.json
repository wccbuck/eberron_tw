        "text": "The [[Galifar]] Code of Justice (or \"Code of Galifar\") was the intricate system of\nlaws, rights, and regulations that defined the legal structure of the unified kingdom of Galifar before the [[Last War]].\nThe Galifar code survives intact in [[Breland]] and [[Aundair]].\n[[Karrnath]]’s [[legal code|Code of Kaius]] is more rigid and less forgiving than\nthe Galifar code on which it was based, and [[Thrane]]’s\ntheocratic government has replaced the code with a\nmore stringent set of religious laws. The other nations of\n[[Khorvaire]] use their own systems of laws and justice that\ntrace their ancestry in varying degrees back to the Code\nof Galifar.\n\nThe laws presume innocence, provide for judgment by\npeers, and establish a complex legal system. If someone\nwinds up in trouble with the law, it is highly recommended\nthat the subject obtain the services of a solicitor or councilor\nskilled in the Code of Justice. Even with laws and enforcers,\nthe Code leaves enough loopholes and gaps in the system\nfor experienced criminals to take advantage of.",
