Bebiliths are enormous arachnid [[demon]]s that hunt weaker [[immortal]]s, but they tend to favor other [[demon]]s. A bebilith's forelegs span more than 14 feet and end in wicked barbs, and globs of foul goo drip from its fanged mouth. Bebiliths understand but do not speak [[Abyssal]]; their telepathy allows them to communicate silently with one another.
