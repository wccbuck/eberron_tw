In Aerenal, you might...

* Consult an [[elven|elf]] [[archmage|wizard]] who's been dead for twenty thousand years.
* Battle sinister forces that have crawled into [[Eberron]] from a realm of eternal night.
* Learn secrets of magic unknown in [[Khorvaire]].

The massive island of Aerenal ("[[Aeren]]'s Rest") is the ancient kingdom
of the [[elves|elf]]. Its jungles provide strange and valuable
lumbers: [[soarwood]] used for the hulls of [[airship]]s, tough
[[bronzewood]], and trees that remain alive after being felled.

The island's proximity to the planes of [[Irian]] and
[[Mabar]] allows the lines
between life and death to become blurred. Dangerous, dark forces creep in from the plane known as the
Endless Night, but that planar resonance also enables
the elves to perform feats of [[necromancy]] unmatched
elsewhere in [[Eberron]]. Among the [[Aereni]] elves, the
honored dead walk among the living. Heroes who died
in glorious battle return to serve the [[Sibling Kings]]. And
in the depths of [[Shae Mordai]], the deathless lords of the
[[Undying Court]] study the shifting balance of the planes
and the path of the [[Draconic Prophecy]]. 

[[Necromancy|necromancy]] is a pillar of [[Aereni]] society, distinct from
the sinister power most adventurers encounter. Positive
energy sustains the [[deathless]] [[undead]] of Aerenalâ€”both
the light of [[Irian]] and the devotion freely given by their
descendants. The elves of Aerenal despise necromancy
that draws on the negative energy of [[Mabar]], and agents
of the [[Undying Court]] embrace their mandate to seek out
and destroy [[vampire]]s, [[lich]]es, and other such undead.

Aereni civilization is over twenty thousand years old.
Secure in their island sanctuary, the [[elves|elf]] watched nations of [[goblin]]s and [[human]]s rise and fall. The Aereni
possess secrets and powers the rest of [[Khorvaire]] has
yet to discover, but they are more interested in perfecting their ancient traditions than in innovation and discovery. An [[Aereni]] [[wizard]] might spend a decade refining
the pronunciation of a single [[spell]]'s incantation. For
now, [[humanity|human]] can't match the power of the elves. If that
balance changes, will Aerenal take action?

!! {{!!title}}'s Influence in Khorvaire

In [[Khorvaire]], you might...

* Team up with an agent of the [[Undying Court]] to bring down a powerful [[vampire]].
* Be summoned by a deathless sage who needs your help to fulfill an ancient prophecy.
* Bargain with a merchant offering rare [[magic item]]s.

Few [[Aereni]] elves are interested in the world beyond
their island. The Aereni see [[Khorvaire]] as a primitive
backwater, and [[human]]s as dangerously impulsive. Aereni who travel to Khorvaire have a concrete purpose for
the journey, which could drive an adventure.

The [[magewright]]s and [[artificer]]s of Aerenal are more
advanced than those of Khorvaire. Aereni artisans
fashion rods, staffs, and wands, and other rare or even
legendary items may come from Aerenal. However, the
nation is less industrialized than Khorvaire. Legendary items aren't mass produced; some are personally
crafted by members of the [[Undying Court]].

Aereni goods make use of exotic plants and woods.
[[Bronzewood|bronzewood]] has the density and even some of the properties of steel; an Aereni [[cleric]] might wear a
bronzewood breastplate, while a [[paladin]] of the [[Undying Court]] could wear a suit of elaborated engraved bronzewood plate armor. Bronzewood leaves are remarkably
tough, and the Aereni craft "leaf weave" armor functionally equivalent to leather, studded leather, or chain mail.
Bronzewood can also be crafted into weapons, and Aereni warriors use spears or swords made from a single
piece of bronzewood.
