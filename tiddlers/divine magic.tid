Unlike [[arcane magic]], there's no logic to divine magic, no pure science that can
explain exactly how it works. An acolyte might spend years meditating and praying, performing virtuous deeds, and tending their flock, and still never gain the power of a [[cleric]]; meanwhile, a smith who can't even read might feel [[Onatar]]'s guiding hands and cast something like [[magecraft]]. Divine magic requires two things: transcendental faith and a connection to a divine power source.

Faith is about conviction. It can't be something you
approach rationally. You need to know in your heart that the
magical effect you seek to produce with your spell should
and will happen. Whether you're smiting an enemy or
healing an ally, you know that the enemy will fall and that
you will save your friend. This doesn't mean that you have
to be a zealot with no doubts whatsoever; you can question
your overall course of action. But you can't think about your
doubts in the moment of casting the spell; in that instant,
you must have pure and absolute certainty that the spell
will come to pass.

But faith alone isn't enough; you also need a connection
to a source of divine power. In Eberron, no one can prove
whether the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]] or other deities existâ€”if [[Onatar]]
actually guides all artisans or if [[Dol Dorn]] and [[Dol Arrah]]
truly watch over every battlefield. But whether or not Dol
Arrah exists, when her [[paladin]] smites a foe, they draw that power from something. The paladin believes it to be Dol Arrah granting her favor, and maybe it is. Or maybe the shared faith of the tens of thousands of people who believe in the Sovereigns has created wells of power in the collective unconscious, and the paladin draws on this powerful force instead. In a practical sense, the truth is irrelevant; regardless
of its nature and source, the power exists. And this is where
science fails. The [[Silver Flame]] is a source of divine power,
a force that has held [[demon]]s at bay for millennia. Those
who seek to defend the innocent and fight supernatural evil
can draw on its power. But why does one templar become a
paladin over another of equal faith? Why does an illiterate
farmer gain the gift of divine magic when a religious scholar
who's spent decades studying texts doesn't? People of faith
usually respond that it's because the farmer was chosen by
[[Arawai]], or because one templar was more open than the
other to the [[Voice of the Flame|Tira Miron]]. Maybe that's true, or maybe
it's all just luck.

[[Magewright|magewright]]s who channel divine magic are called [[adept]]s.
