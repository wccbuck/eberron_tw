This translucent shield can be used to defend against attacks from both corporeal and incorporeal creatures, such as [[spirit]]s or creatures in the [[Ethereal Veil]]. Both corporeal and incorporeal creatures can touch, pick up, and otherwise physically interact with this shield. Incorporeal creatures carrying a ghost touch shield can still pass freely through solid objects with the shield.
