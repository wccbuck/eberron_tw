Recognized as a single allied nation\nunder the [[Treaty of Thronehold]], the principalities are\nmore of a loose alliance. Each island domain has its\nown values, goals, and feuds with other domains.\nThe Lhazaar are the finest sailors in Khorvaire. During\nthe [[Last War]], they served all nations as privateers and\nengaged in piracy on the side. When the war ended, they\nreturned to the merchant trade, but pirates still hunt on\nthe open seas.\n\nThe Lhazaar value their independence. Here, anyone\ncan rise to captain a ship or even seize a principality.\nLeadership is earned, not given. Nevertheless, High\nPrince [[Ryger ir'Wynarn]] of [[Regalport]] seeks to forge the\nprincipalities into a unified force. He has the finest fleet,\nand his efforts ensured that the principalities gained recognition at [[Thronehold]], after which he awarded himself\nthe title of High Prince. So far, the other princes have\nrejected his proposals for a stronger union.\n\nSome principalities are devoted to the [[Blood of Vol]]\nand a few favor the [[Sovereign Host]]. Beyond these, the\nLhazaar show little enthusiasm for religion, though\nmany curse the [[Devourer]] when a storm comes. \n\n!! Interesting Things About {{!!article}}{{!!title}}\n\n* Rulership of the principalities is so fluid that it's possible for someone to start the day as a sailor and end it as a prince. A campaign could easily be based around a party of adventurers gaining a principality.\n* The [[Wind Whisperer|Wind Whisperers]] principality includes a number of [[half-elves|half-elf]] with the [[Mark of Storm]] foundlings with no tie to House [[Lyrandar]]. The Wind Whisperers want to obtain [[airship]]s by any means necessary.\n* The Lhazaar Principalities have the largest [[changeling]] population in [[Khorvaire]]. Many of them congregate in the [[Gray Tide]], a domain founded by changelings. \n* The hunting of [[drake turtle]]s is a major part of the Lhazaar economy, and most armor is made from drake turtle scale or bone. \n\n!! Lhazaar Characters\n\nAs you develop a Lhazaar character or NPC, consider the following:\n\n* ''Seafarers and Swashbucklers.'' Most Lhazaar spend more time at sea than they do on land. Sailor is an appropriate background for any Lhazaar, but you can ask your GM if you can switch a tool proficiency for vehicles (water) proficiency. Lhazaar are flamboyant people with little concern for the law, so charlatan, entertainer, and folk hero are all appropriate backgrounds.\n* ''Local Customs.'' Each principality has its own martial traditions, fashions, and slang. Think about how your choices reflect your principality and work with your GM to develop one that fits your character. \n* ''Big Dreams.'' Whatever their circumstances, the people of the principalities always look to the future. What do you want? To find a forgotten treasure hoard? To command your own ship? To take your place as a prince? Think big and chase your dreams. \n\n!! Cities and Sites\n\nAmong the myriad ports and pirate redoubts of the\nLhazaar Principalities are ancient ruins from forgotten\ncivilizations that predate even the [[Dhakaan]]i Empire, as\nwell as tombs built by wealthy pirates and sea lords to\nhouse their treasures and earthly remains.\n\n!!!

Principalities\n\n<<list-links-article \"[tag{!!title}category[organization]sort[title]]\">>\n\n!! Aftermath of the Last War\n\nDuring the Last War, the Lhazaar served as privateers\nand pirates. Outsiders wonder if the principalities can\nadapt to peace, or if their thirst for gold and adventure\nwill lead their subjects to ruin.\n\nMost of the princes are content with their domains,\nbut ambitious rulers such as Prince [[Ryger|Ryger ir'Wynarn]] of [[Regalport]]\nand Prince [[Kolberkon]] of [[Port Verge]] could shatter the\nstatus quo. Kolberkon seeks to expand his personal\npower, while Ryger wants to forge a stronger unified\nnation. Both pursue dangerous alliances in their campaigns. In addition to agreements with the [[dragonmarked house]]s, rumors abound of bargains with [[dragon]]s, [[fiend]]s, and the distant Empire of [[Riedra]]. Will the\ndreams of these princes lead to a new war? ",
