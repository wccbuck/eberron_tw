An imposing red-skinned [[hobgoblin]] with flashing fire-red eyes, "Brimstone" Brakker gets
his nickname from his penchant for using [[noxious smokestick]]s and [[thunderstone]]s when conducting his violent business. Originally from [[Darguun]], this fearsome hobgoblin has made a name for himself since immigrating to [[Sharn]], and he is wanted by the [[City Watch|Sharn Watch]] for a long list of crimes.
