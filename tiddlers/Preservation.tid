tooltip: universal property: incapacitated creatures are stabilized and preserved in ice
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While on a [[plane]] with this property, creatures that are incapacitated are stabilized and enter a state of suspended animation. If an unconscious creature remains in contact with the ground for more than one minute, it's drawn below the surface and encased in an ice-encrusted stasis. While encased in this way, time ceases to flow for the creature and it doesn't grow older.
