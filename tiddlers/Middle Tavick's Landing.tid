''Representative on the [[Sharn Council]]: [[Dalaina Ironhand]]''

Unlike the [[upper ward|Upper Tavick's Landing]], Middle Tavick's Landing welcomes travelers and tourists. The ward features a host
of lively taverns and excellent inns. The [[Cornerstone|Cornerstone (arena)]] is
a huge arena that hosts events ranging from circuses to aerial jousting. The [[Deathsgate]] district caters to adventurers, much as the [[Clifftop]] district of Upper Dura does.
Like Clifftop, the district has an adventurer's guildâ€”though the [[Deathsgate Guild]] has a dark reputation, and
its members often pick fights with Clifftop adventurers. House [[Jorasco]] has a large house of healing in the
ward, and House [[Deneith]] maintains a recruiting station
for would-be mercenaries.

The [[Grawand]] district has deep roots in [[Karrnath]]i
culture that predate the [[Last War]]; [[Slogar's]] and the
[[Bloody Mug]] are places where homesick Karrns can
enjoy blood sausage and Nightwood ale. The district is a
haven for Karrnathi soldiers who want to avoid Brelish aggression and a place where followers of the [[Blood of Vol]] can practice their faith.

[[Tavick's Market]] is one of [[Sharn]]'s major market districts; located directly above the [[Terminus]] [[lightning rail]] station, it's filled with stands selling produce and goods brought in by local farmers.
