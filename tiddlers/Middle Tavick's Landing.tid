type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Unlike the [[upper ward|Upper Tavick's Landing]], Middle Tavick's Landing welcomes travelers and tourists. The ward features a host
of lively taverns and excellent inns. The [[Cornerstone|Cornerstone (arena)]] is
a huge arena that hosts events ranging from circuses to aerial jousting. The [[Deathsgate]] district caters to adventurers, much as the [[Clifftop]] district of Upper Dura does.
Like Clifftop, the district has an adventurer's guildâ€”though the [[Deathsgate Guild]] has a dark reputation, and
its members often pick fights with Clifftop adventurers. House [[Jorasco]] has a large house of healing in the
ward, and House [[Deneith]] maintains a recruiting station
for would-be mercenaries. 

The [[Grawand]] district has deep roots in [[Karrnath]]i
culture that predate the [[Last War]]; [[Slogar's]] and the
[[Bloody Mug]] are places where homesick Karrns can
enjoy blood sausage and Nightwood ale. The district is a
haven for Karrnathi soldiers who want to avoid Brelish aggression and a place where followers of the [[Blood of Vol]] can practice their faith.

[[Tavick's Market]] is one of [[Sharn]]'s major market districts; located directly above the [[Terminus]] [[lightning rail]] station, it's filled with stands selling produce and goods brought in by local farmers.

** The [[Cornerstone|Cornerstone (arena)]]. A massive arena that hosts a wide array of sporting events. These include jousts and races, both on foot and through the air. The ''Stone Trees'' is an offshoot of the Cornerstone that serves as the playing field for [[hrazhak]] competitions.

* [[Dancing Shadows]]. This district offers middle-of-the-road accommodations to the many people who arrive in Sharn every day.
