title: boulder seed
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This small pebble-like seed can be thrown. When it strikes the ground, it suddenly grows into a boulder up to 20 feet in diameter, shoving or bludgeoning anything in its way as it grows. However, the boulder will only grow as large as the surrounding space allows.
