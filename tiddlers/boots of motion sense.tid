title: boots of motion sense
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

These boots are made from red leather with thin soles. While wearing these boots, the user becomes highly sensitive to ground vibrations. If their feet are touching the ground, they can sense any movement within 60 ft, and it becomes almost impossible to sneak up on them.
