The warlord [[Duul Hashraac]] leads the [[Kech Hashraac]] of the [[Heirs of Dhakaan]]; he is
noteworthy both for being a "daashor" [[artificer]] as opposed to a common warrior, and for using his clan name instead of “Dhakaan” as his sobriquet. Duul is proud of what his people have achieved; whether he seeks the throne or serves as kingmaker, he believes the "Keepers of Thunder" hold the keys to Dhakaani victory.
