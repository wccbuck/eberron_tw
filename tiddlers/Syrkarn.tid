''Population:'' <<ntls>>

Five thousand years before the arrival of the [[Inspired]] and the present age, the nations now known collectively as Syrkarn were the jewels in the imperial crown of old
[[Sarlona]]. Today, only ancient stonework and half-forgotten
legends mark the fall, passing, and rebirth of this land.
Still, to those who have inherited this seemingly inhospitable kingdom, Syrkarn offers a gift denied to both the warring nations of the past and the Inspired-dominated
lands of the present. To its [[people|Syrks]], Syrkarn is the promise of freedom.

Syrkarn is a vast expanse of arid plains where four nations
of old once stood. Its history is rich with conflict and
conquest, and it is one of the few places in [[Sarlona]] where
the devastating effects of the ancient [[magewars|Sundering]] can still
be seen, untouched by [[Inspired]] reconstruction. A land
surrounded by [[Riedra]] yet distinct from it, Syrkarn has
long been left to its own devices for reasons that none but
the Inspired understand.

Nearly all settlements in Syrkarn are agricultural centers—communal farmsteads (//daabi// in the [[Giant]] tongue) that trap the windblown soil of the steppes
behind vast networks of berms and stone walls. However,
nearly a third of Syrkarn's population lives on the open
steppes. Though most are nomadic herders or hunters, a
distinct class of traders (mostly [[eneko]]) are the lifeblood
of commerce across the nation. Regular trade roads
carry goods, laborers, and knowledge between the larger
settlements, allowing the [[Syrks]] to maintain a social
infrastructure that belies the land's isolation.

!! Land of the Far Horizon

Syrkarn is an arid landscape of harsh deserts, lush grasslands, and endless steppes sloping up from the southern extent of the [[Sea of Rage]]. Its population consists of an
almost equal mix of Sarlonan [[human]] clans and tribes of [[eneko]]—the "Children of the Sand" who trace their lineage back to the nation of [[Borunan]].

Though the climate and the isolated life of this
land are never easy, the coastal steppes and inland
savannah of Syrkarn offer limitless range for animals
and agriculture. Herds of wild bison and domesticated
goats, deer, and horses roam the grasslands, while
cultivated fields of oat grass and flax spread across the
[[Itzaina|Khunan]] plains and the steppes of the [[Lamecha]] lowlands.
The natives grow a range of vegetable crops, including the gnarled root known as [[sepse]], native to Sarlona and prized for its high nutritional value. Exotic spices
found nowhere outside Sarlona thrive in the heat of
the savannah, as does [[dreamlily]]. Use of the drug is
rare among the [[Syrk|Syrks]] humans, but the [[eneko]] (who are
immune to dreamlily's narcotic effects) grow it for its
medicinal value. Harvests are hard in some years, but
the clans and tribes of Syrkarn know bounty more often
than not.

Though the ruins of great cities dot the landscape, modern-day Syrkarn is predominantly a land of hamlets, villages, and nomadic town sites. The remnants
of [[human]] cities are common in the former lands of
[[Mae-Kree]], [[Sunyagir]], and [[Lamecha]], but the plains
and savannah that were once [[Khunan]] are marked exclusively by the ruins of the [[yuan-ti]]. [[Shulatlaca|shulatlaca]] and yuan-ti ruins are especially common on the [[Hailana Islands]], said to be the site from which the yuan-ti launched
their desperate voyage to [[Argonnessen]] and left their
homeland behind.

[[Wild zone|wild zone]]s linked to [[Fernia]], [[Risia]], and especially [[Lamannia]] are found throughout this land. Like all of [[Sarlona]], Syrkarn is beset by storms whose force borders on the unnatural, and
planar disturbances flare and flood across the steppes
like unnatural wellsprings. Still, these rifts are seldom
as haunting or destructive as the [[reality storm]]s of the
[[Tundra|Tashana Tundra]]. The prominent planar connection in Syrkarn
is the [[Whitewater]], the crystal-clear lake believed to
mark a [[manifest zone]] linked to [[Lamannia]].

A few [[rogue dragon]]s roam the savannas and deserts of Syrkarn, most notably [[Qataakhast]] the Bright-Eyed.

!! Getting There

As with any other destination in [[Sarlona]], travel to
Syrkarn is never undertaken lightly. The direct sea route
from eastern [[Khorvaire]] covers the entire length of
the [[Sea of Rage]]. Ships embarking from Khorvaire's western shores must ply the [[Barren Sea]] and the [[Sea of Lost Souls]]. In either case, the journey is long, and ships
must pass through the waters of unwelcoming [[Riedra]].
Most ships traveling to Syrkarn are privateers from
the [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] isles making trade runs, and the majority
of adventurers arriving in Sarlona take passage on a
Lhazaar ship. The privateers' destination is almost always the
southern port of [[Ardhmen]].

Attempting to land an unauthorized ship in [[Riedra]]n-controlled
territory is extremely dangerous. As a result, travelers
who have secret dealings often enter Riedra across the
Syrkarn frontier. Likewise, [[kalashtar]] pilgrims and
refugee Riedrans seeking to escape the gaze of the
[[Thousand Eyes]] usually make their way to [[Khorvaire]] by
way of Syrkarn.

Khorvairian ships traveling east often stop at
[[Stormreach]] before returning to [[Sharn]], seeking to maximize their profits on the long voyage with a quick pickup of [[Xen'drik]] goods. Those [[eneko]] who leave Syrkarn
typically book passage on that route, seeking to experience the lands of their forgotten [[giant]] explorers.

!! Five Common Syrkarn Legends

# ''Syrkarn is free.'' Though nominally a protectorate of [[Riedra]], Syrkarn and its people owe no fealty to that land or its [[Inspired]] overlords. When occasional muttering chalks this fact up only to Riedra's apparent lack of interest in Syrkarn. a pint or two of [[ustah]] and a toast to the past will drown it out.
# ''In the past, greatness lingers.'' The [[eneko]] are descendants of [[ogre]]s and [[giant]]s, the latter thought to be explorers from ancient [[Xen'drik]]. From this lineage, the tribes believe that the blood of both the mighty titans of Xen'drik and the former [[oni]] [[sorcerer]]-kings of [[Sarlona]] flows in their veins.
# ''The yuan-ti once held this land in the iron grip of dark magic—and seek to do so again.'' The [[yuan-ti]] empire that rose in the ruins of [[Khunan]] is one of the few pieces of old [[Sarlona]]n history still predominant in the age of [[Riedra]]. Some speculate that this is so because Riedra wants it that way, and many Syrks question whether the yuan-ti are a force to be fought along with the [[Inspired]], or a potential ally in the fight against Sarlona's masters.
# ''The giant-based faiths of the eneko hide dark secrets.'' The [[eneko]] tribes follow religious traditions drawn from the faith of ancient [[Xen'drik]], [[Rushemé]]. However, it is said that dark cults among the "Children of the Sand" use the veneration of [[Karrak]] (thought to be an aspect of the [[Keeper]]) to conceal the practice of dark magic.
# ''Beneath the beauty of Syrkarn, dark things abide.'' No one who has ridden the [[Itzaina|Khunan]] range or spent a night within sight of the [[Whitewater]] can deny the natural splendor that is Syrkarn. At the same time, whispered rumors speak of a nameless darkness in the desert, and of voices that call to those who walk the plains alone. Some who seek to define this darkness speak of connections between the fragmentary legends of the [[yuan-ti]] and the lore of the [[Age of Demons]]. What the truth is, none can say.

!! Who Rules Syrkarn

According to the [[Unity]] of [[Riedra]], Syrkarn is a protectorate of that nation, and ostensibly owes fealty to Riedra and the [[Inspired]]. In truth, however, the Inspired's last act of governance in Syrkarn was to order the land emptied of its [[human]] population in the aftermath of a victorious purge of the [[yuan-ti]] more than twelve centuries ago.

"Sahar" is a general term of leadership common among both humans and [[eneko]], but it can cover a wide range of power. The sahar of a nomadic tribe might rule only two dozen people, half of them her immediate family. The sahar of a large settlement might rule a mixed population of a thousand humans and eneko, and have ultimate authority over security, trade, and commerce in a wide region.

In larger settlements, sahar are usually elected to
fixed-year terms, the exact length of which is set by
tradition. Among the tribes and clanholds, leadership is a matter of strength or will, with warriors, spellcasters, or manifesters of [[psionics]] often taking up the mantle of power.
Whether by social accident or design, no central leadership exists in Syrkarn, though the sahar of [[Nderitese]]—the territory's largest settlement—is
sometimes asked to broker disputes between other settlements and larger clans.

Smaller disagreements on trade, tariffs, and power
sharing are typically handled by the time-honored tradition of threats and force, but the reality of Syrkarn means that its people typically have little reason to fight.
Resources and land are plentiful, and the common culture
forged by [[eneko]] and [[human]] has created social customs and
a rule of law unheard of in agrarian tribal societies.

However, those Riedran exiles who monitor the
activities of the [[Inspired]] in Syrkarn often claim to see
signs of subtle manipulation of the clans and tribes that
hint of [[psionics]]. Rival chieftains who have long histories
of being at each other's throats will suddenly declare a
mutual commitment to peace and allegiance. Smaller
factions will suddenly gain tactical sophistication that
allows them to thwart the expansionist plans of more
powerful nomadic tribes, or force the larger settlements
into a defensive stance.

The least populous (and most mysterious) residents
of Syrkarn are the [[yuan-ti]]. Descended from the few of
their kind who did not flee to [[Argonnessen]] when their
nation was overthrown, these serpentfolk keep themselves well hidden. Even after twelve hundred years, the utter destruction of the yuan-ti at the command of the
[[Inspired]] remains a potent reminder of the power the
lords of [[Riedra]] can bring to bear.

!! Foreign Relations

[[Syrks]] are content to leave others alone and hope for the
same in return. For all intents and purposes, [[Riedra]] is
the nation's only neighbor, and the monolithic and isolationist bent of that land means that Syrks frequently
define themselves as its antithesis.

!!! Riedra

The [[Inspired]] in [[Riedra]] clearly have the resources and the
military might to take Syrkarn in a heartbeat, driving
its people into the sea if they so chose. Although desert
and mountain marks much of Syrkarn's inland frontier,
unlike [[Adar]], no natural or mystical defenses protect this
land from invasion.

The fact that the Inspired have chosen not to invade
suggests that they have strong reasons to leave Syrkarn
as it is. The [[Thousand Eyes]] has agents throughout the land, but these seem primarily focused on maintaining the status quo among the tribes and clans. Isolated skirmishes are sometimes made against the human exiles, but clear benefits can be seen in Riedra's allowing the exile clans to survive as a beacon to the like-minded. No matter how many exiles swell its population, vast Syrkarn
will never have the resources or the population to challenge
the [[Inspired]]. Better to have those who oppose Inspired rule
flee for the "freedom" of the barbarian frontier than to
disturb the Riedran peace.

Riedran agents harass the [[eneko]] tribes with
greater frequency than they do the [[human]] clans. Some
speculate that this behavior marks a fear that the Children of the Sand are more apt to pursue dark magic, as has been seen in the recent rise of the [[Karrak]] cults. It is known that the
[[Horned Shadow]] has sought to recruit eneko from Syrkarn in recent years, but whether any connection exists between the rebellious [[oni]] and
the cults remains to be seen.

More than anything else, [[Inspired]] agents seek signs
of magic use in Syrkarn. They are especially watchful
for any sign of the [[Heirs of Ohr Kaluun]] in the steppes
and the [[yuan-ti]] ruins. When it is found, the [[arcane|arcane magic]] is
exterminated. Riedra is intent on seeing that Syrkarn's
lost lore stays that way.

Sharing a desert border as it does with [[Borunan]],
Syrkarn has a more open relationship with the former
[[ogre]] kingdom than with the other Riedran provinces.
Just as the ogres made their way south centuries ago,
more than a few [[eneko]] make the trek north today. The
eneko in the [[Savage Legion|Taskaan Legion]] are drawn from the ranks
of such Syrk exiles.

!!! Adar

The lands of the mountain refuge of [[Adar]] border Syrkarn to the
southeast, and the outposts of that frontier are firmly in
[[Inspired]] hands. For the Syrks of the border territories,
the land along [[Jahara Sound]], guarded by a series of
coastal forts, is merely another part of [[Riedra]], and that
nation's business with the folk of the distant mountains
is none of their concern.

However, for those Syrks who actively oppose the rule
of the [[Inspired]], the [[Adarans]] are brothers in arms. The
treacherous seas and inhospitable cliffs of [[Adar]] channel
those seeking to enter the mountain refuge to Syrkarn,
where they land at [[Ardhmen]] or the smaller fishing villages of the western coast. They then make their way
inland, crossing into Adar between Riedran outposts
and patrols.

Syrkarn is also the departure point for the goods that
[[Adarans]] trade to [[Khorvaire]], and a steady flow of couriers
passes along the [[Summit Road]] throughout the year.

!!! Other Nations

Outside of academic circles, few non-[[Sarlona]]ns even
know of the existence of Syrkarn. Unlike the [[Adar]]an
monks and the [[kalashtar]] who have established enclaves on
[[Khorvaire]], [[Syrks]] have little reason to leave their land.

Since the end of the [[Last War]], [[Lhazaar|Lhazaar Principalities]] traders have
made their way to [[Ardhmen]] in order to barter for spices
and [[dreamlily]]. However, with the [[Inspired]] now actively
directing trade between [[Riedra]] and [[Khorvaire]], Syrk
merchants are seeking contacts among the Riedrans,
hoping to broker more profitable trade in mainstream
Khorvaire. The merchants of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]
have largely turned their own trade to Syrk art, antiquities, and textiles—their quality as high as Riedran goods, but their design incorporating an old-Sarlonan aesthetic
lost to Riedra.

!! The Syrkarn Overlord

From fragments of [[yuan-ti]] lore and contemporary
human records, some scholars assert that a demonic [[overlord]]
exists in Syrkarn, possibly beneath the ruined yuan-ti
city of [[Sustrai Mor]]. The [[eneko]] [[Karrak]] cults are said to
be numerous within the wasted plain that surrounds the
ruins. Among the Syrk nomads, the city has a reputation
for being haunted or overrun with secret sects of yuan-ti.

Whatever the truth, the Syrks avoid the place.
Whether the [[Inspired]] or the [[Dreaming Dark]] have
reason to fear the might of a bound [[overlord]] is an open
question. It seems likely, though, that the Inspired's
unwillingness to risk the resources necessary to destroy the Syrkarn [[fiend]] drove the decision to simply empty that
land—denying the fiend (and its inevitable [[Lords of Dust]]
allies) the followers it would inevitably seek.

At the same time, the Inspired show little of the same
concern for the overlords thought to be trapped in the [[Tashana Tundra]]
and [[Adar]]. Perhaps the lords of [[Riedra]] have some plan for
keeping these other fiends in check, either before, or
preferably after, they run rampant in those lands. At the
same time, the fall of [[Khunan]] and the subsequent rise of
the yuan-ti suggests to some that the Syrk overlord was once
unbound—and that whatever act saw it put down might not
have bound it as strongly as the Inspired would like.

Abel Varmanc, patron and leader of the [[Korranberg]] expedition that bore his name, has gained recent notice for his attempts to collect the fragmentary lore of old Sarlona
from Riedran merchants engaging in trade with [[Khorvaire]].
In academic papers and private debate, he has suggested
that some lingering power from the [[Age of Demons]] was not
only involved in the creation of the [[yuan-ti]], but also in the
destruction of [[Khunan]] that preceded that genesis. In his
view, oral traditions describing the legendary devastation of
Khunan bear an eerie similarity to the events in [[Thrane]] of
299 YK, when the rising of a terrible [[force|Bel Shalor]] bound since the
[[Age of Demons]] gave birth to a manifestation of [[Silver Flame]] through the
sacrifice of a [[couatl]] and the [[paladin]] [[Tira Miron]]. Whether
the destruction of Khunan was the result of a bound [[fiend]]'s
stirrings or of potent magic wielded by the Khunani in their
attempts to confine it once more, "Syrkarn" is the name the
legends give to that dark presence.
