Korlass, or "dream stone", is a substance used by the [[sahuagin]] of the [[Eternal Dominion]] as an industrial material. It is formed from the biomass of the [[kar'lassa]], the gargantuan beasts that form the foundation of their cities at the bottom of the [[Thunder Sea]]. Korlass can be sculpted like clay, then fixed in its shape by a [[magewright]] ritual. It has the strength of steel, with a texture similar to shell, though its appearance varies depending on which [[kar'lassa]] itâ€™s drawn from.
