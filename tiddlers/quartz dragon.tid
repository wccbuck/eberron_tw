Shimmering with radiant energy and brimming with life, quartz dragons (or "crystal dragons") enjoy an innate [[psionic|psionics]] connection to the [[plane]] of [[Irian]] that suffuses their bodies as well as their personalities with light. Though they prefer to live in desolate, frigid regions, many of them are among the friendliest of dragonkind, nurturing and optimistic. Many quartz dragons study the stars, recording their observations of the night sky and tracking the signs written in starlight. They read these signs as omens, giving them glimpses of what is to come, and they eagerly examine the potential futures of any creatures who come to them in peace.

When they hatch, quartz dragons have dull gray scales, with a few white or clear crystalline points, allowing the wyrmlings to blend in to rocky terrain
in the face of danger. As they age, their scales turn snow white, then slowly fade to transparency. The oldest quartz dragons have scales of perfect
clarity that bend and refract light, sometimes making them difficult to see clearly.

The radiant energy of the [[Eternal Dawn|Irian]] shimmers in quartz dragons’ scales. It glows like starlight between their bodies and the spines and horns
that hover close to their heads and backs. These horns shift with the dragon’s mood: bristling with anger, lying back with fear or suspicion, and
rippling in side-to-side waves with amusement or joy.

!! Magic and Breath Weapon

The quartz dragon can exhale a scintillating burst of brilliant radiance, causing radiant damage. In addition, adult quartz dragons can manifest [[psionic powers|psionics]] such as [[dancing lights]], [[charm]] [[command]], [[divination]], [[restoration]], [[hypnotic pattern]], and [[invisibility]].

Quartz dragons can also cast [[clairvoyance]] at will as long as they have access to a large surface of ice or quartz as the focus for that spell.
