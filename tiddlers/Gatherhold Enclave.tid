type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The [[Ghallanda]] headquarters is a great stronghold on the eastern shore of [[Lake Cyre]], located in the cliff dwellings of [[Gatherhold]]. The enclave is the jumping-off point for many an adventure in eastern [[Khorvaire]]. The ramps that connect one cliff
dwelling to another are always teeming with nomadic
[[Talenta|Talenta Plains]] tribesmen, caravans en route to [[Valenar]] or
[[Q'barra]], or adventurers embarking on expeditions
into the eastern [[Mournland]]. The houseâ€™s baron,
[[Yoren d'Ghallanda]], has his personal domain deep in
the cliff-tunnels.

The [[enclave]] is largely dug into the cliffside, and is generally cozier than the subterranean structures of [[dwarves|dwarf]] or [[goblin]]s. Outsiders aren't often invited into the heart of the enclave, and it's not built to accommodate creatures as large as [[human]]s.
