The mountain has been carved and shaped to create a bas-relief sculpture over 1,000 feet high. Rising from the smooth stone face are the images of the [[Six Kings|Jhazaal Dhakaan]], [[hobgoblin]] warlords who came together to create the empire that once ruled the continent of [[Khorvaire]]. The second and third figures have been damaged, either by the passage of years or some forgotten act of vandalism. The valley at the foot of the monument has been a campsite of many monstrous war parties through the ages, and it must be acknowledged that many [[goblinoid]] commanders who stopped to pay their respects to the lords of old found great success in the campaigns that followed. Caves pierce the mount at the base of the carvings, and it is said that an ancient armory of [[byeshk]] weapons is hidden within the caves, and that the [[ghost]]s of Dhakaani champions test those who would enter, allowing those found worthy to emerge with a single weapon to carry into battle.",
