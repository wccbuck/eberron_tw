title: Berserker Rage (talent)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You enter the rage of the berserker, perhaps channeling [[primal magic]] through your body and embracing a wild state of untrammeled fury. While in this frenzied state, you cannot take any action that requires delicacy, calm, or patience; but any physical action you //do// take is performed with [[advantage]]. Feats of strength or athletics, heavy attacks, or intimidating shouts are all enhanced for the duration of the rage.

The rage lasts for 1 minute, but ends early if you are knocked unconscious or you haven't taken an aggressive action or suffered [[harm]] in the last 10 seconds. When the rage ends, suffer 3 [[stress]]. You can enter a rage twice per day.
