He is a [[cleric]] of the [[Order Domain]], but his [[divine magic]] manifests in subtle ways. As second-in-command under Preceptor [[Cadoc Belmin]], Hemdoth manages routine business of the Temple, handles the Temple's finances, and teaches a few classes including Military History and Ethics in War.\n\n!! Appearance and Personality \n\nPerhaps Prior Aggan's most noticeable feature is his complete lack of hair over his entire body. His voice is rather loud, and his conversations can frequently be overheard from the opposite end of the Martial Temple's long hallways. Prior Aggan is extremely driven and calculating, especially under times of stress. He insists on learning every side of a story before expressing an opinion.",
