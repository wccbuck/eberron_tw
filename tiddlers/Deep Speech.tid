Deep Speech or "Undercommon" is the twisted [[language]] of [[Xoriat]], and is spoken by [[daelkyr]] and most [[aberration]]s that have a connection to the Realm of Madness. The language was named "Deep Speech" by the [[Mror|Mror Holds]] [[dwarves|dwarf]], as it is the language of the creatures who dwell in the [[Realm Below]]. 

Unlike other [[immortal]] languages, Deep Speech seems to constantly evolve, but anyone who understands it understands the current form of it. There is something inherently unnatural and supernatural about Undercommon, and knowing it changes your brain.

Curiously, this evolution means that ancient inscriptions in Deep Speech can actually take on new meanings when read in the modern day.
