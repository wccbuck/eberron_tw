In [[Droaam]], the city of [[Graywall]] is governed by Xorchylic the Old, a [[mind flayer]] of great might. A cold and unsettling individual, Xorchylic is extremely old, with wasted, withered flesh. But its mind is still sharp, and its mental powers are as deadly as ever. It is loyal to the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] and ruthlessly carries out their will, keeping a semblance of order in [[Graywall]] as it continues to expand its walls. Xorchylic personally commands the [[Flayer Guard]], a force of [[ogre]]s, [[orc]]s, and [[minotaur]]s supplemented by [[harpies|harpy]], [[gargoyle]]s, and a squad of war [[troll]]s of [[Maenya's Fist]]. 

In the taverns of [[Graywall]], rumors abound that the [[hags|Daughters of Sora Kell]]
(led by a vision from [[Sora Teraza]]) found Xorchylic in a vault deep below the ruins of [[Korash Khaar|Khyras]] (what is now Graywall), that the [[mind flayer]] was
imprisoned by its own kind and now seeks to bring a terrible
vengeance to [[Khyber]]. Four years ago, the Daughters installed Xorchylic as governor of [[Graywall]]. The [[hag]]s have bought its loyalty with the promise of aid in
a campaign against a [[demiplane]] of [[Khyber]], and when Xorchylic is ready
it will expect that debt to be paid in full.
