        "text": "The Krertok Peninsula in the [[Tashana Tundra]] of [[Sarlona]] is the apparent origin of the bloodthirsty [[Kalaak]] barbarians. Few are aware that in this region, a strange and terrible relic from the [[Age of Demons]] can be foundâ€”a gargantuan statue of an ancient [[overlord]], the physical remains of a [[demon]] long ago dispatched and bound. The [[Kalaak]] worship this ancient evil, whose vague stirrings of malevolent consciousness power their terrible savagery.",
