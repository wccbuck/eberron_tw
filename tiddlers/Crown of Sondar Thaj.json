        "text": "This thin coronet of twisted [[mithral]] dates back to a hero of the [[Age of Demons]] who fought beside the [[dragon]]s and [[couatl]] against the [[overlord]]s. The crown is elegant and slender, resembling rays of light surrounding the head of the wearer. When a worthy creature puts on the crown, its head is indeed surrounded in a brilliant halo of light. The wearer gains an immunity to harmful radiant and lightning energy. They can cast [[guidance]] for free as a [[uncommon-tier|spell tier]] at will, and can also cast the [[sending]], [[heroes' feast]], and [[globe of invulnerability]] spells.\n\nThe wearer cannot speak any lies while wearing the Crown of Sondar Thaj.\n\nThe crown is believed to lie buried in a hidden shrine in the [[Marsh of Desolation]] in [[Xen'drik]].",
