        "text": "Around the perimeter of the town, the founders of\n[[Stillwater Station]] have arranged a series of thirteen [[conductor stone]]s scavenged from the old [[lightning rail]] lines of [[Cyre]]. Magically altered by Hana dâ€™Cannith, the stones function as a protective energy field, albeit one of unpredictable utility. The circle seems particularly effective at repelling the largest and most dangerous of the [[living spell]]s that wander the [[Mournland]]. The sentient spells, unable to pass beyond the ring of stones, linger for a few hours or days, slowly circling\nthe town, before eventually drifting away.\n\nThe energy field occasionally blocks creatures, as well. In fact, the perimeter stones once repelled a gargantuan mutated [[bulette]] intent on devouring Stillwater whole. However, smaller magical creatures and living spells have been known to pass through the\nbarrier and attack the town. Hana often examines the\nvarious individual perimeter stones, trying to understand and better control their power.",
