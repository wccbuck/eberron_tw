It is also known as \"Stumptown\", because it is built inside the massive stump of a fallen ormatree, the breathtaking thousand-foot-high trees of the Wood. The Crossroads lies along the migratory paths of a number of different nomadic tribes of the [[Eldeen Reaches]], and serves as a central marketplace where people from different communities and sects exchange goods and services.",
