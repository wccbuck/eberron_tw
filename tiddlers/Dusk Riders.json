        "text": "When [[Cyre]] began hiring [[Valenar]] mercenaries, [[Elsaral Quilath]] was one of the ﬁrst war chiefs to respond. Eager to test his blades and lead his forces into battle, he did not\naccept the Cyran offer through messengers or intermediaries, or by traveling to [[Metrol]] and speaking with the Cyran generals. Instead, Elsaral led his [[warband]] to\nthe [[Cyre]]–[[Karrnath]] border and obliterated a Karrnathi\nadvance unit before other forces could even respond to its\npresence. Urban legend tells that Queen [[Mishann|Mishann ir'Wynarn]] herself\nreceived a special delivery: the skull of a Karrn general\netched with the words “We accept” in [[Aerenese]].\n\nElsaral’s [[warband]], nicknamed the Dusk Riders by the\namazed Cyrans, fought constantly throughout the war.\nMost of the time the Riders accepted assignments from\n[[Cyre]], but at various points they took on limited tasks for\nother factions willing to pay. This situation continued up\nuntil the Day of [[Mourning]], when the Dusk Riders were\npresumed lost en masse in the conﬂagration.",
