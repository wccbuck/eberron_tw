They honor their patron ancestors by acting as their ancestor would act in their place, rather than literally attempting to relive their ancestor's actions; in this sense, the Valaes Tairn are actually the most moderate sect of the [[Tairnadal]].\n\nMost of the Valaes Tairn left [[North Aerenal]] for [[Khorvaire]] during the [[Last War]], and now claim the beachhead nation of [[Valenar]].\n\nThe foremost among the swordsmen of the Valaes Tairn are the [[jaeldira]], or \"blade dancers\".",
