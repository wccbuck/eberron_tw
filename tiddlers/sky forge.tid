type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This small anvil is made from cold iron and alchemical silver, with a ring of small [[dragonshard]]s around one larger shard. A sky forge enhances the magical fabrication abilities of a person with the [[Mark of Making]], enabling them to transmute much higher quantities of raw materials into products.
