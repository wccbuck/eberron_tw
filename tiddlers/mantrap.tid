A mantrap is a giant carnivorous [[plant creature]] that resembles an oversized flytrap. When motionless, a mantrap is indistinguishable from an ordinary tropical plant. To attract prey, the mantrap releases a pollen that magically draws creatures to it; when it detects a nearby creature with its [[tremorsense]], it attempts to grab and engulf its prey. Though it will snap its leafy jaws shut around any warm-blooded creature that strays within its reach, it prefers [[humanoid]] prey.
