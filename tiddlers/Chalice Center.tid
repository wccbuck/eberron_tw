This district is a major center of travel and shipping
in [[Fairhaven]]. The House [[Orien]] [[lightning rail]] station
stands just outside its northern gate. A House [[Lyrandar]] [[airship]] tower, one of three similar towers in the city, marks the wardâ€™s southern side. Both of these [[dragonmarked house]]s maintain their enclaves in Chalice
Center. House [[Ghallanda]] also maintains an outpost and auberge here.

Chalice Center is among the most cosmopolitan in [[Aundair]], and one of its well-known
citizen philosophers is [[Thothar Ostren]].
