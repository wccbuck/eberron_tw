This large spherical bottle with golden cap contains tiny roiling clouds with frequent bolts of lightning. When the cap is removed or the bottle is broken, a terrible thunderstorm flows up into the sky. The storm will rage for 2-8 hours, with heavy rain and frequent lightning. If opened inside, the storm will fill the available space.
