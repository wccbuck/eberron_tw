        "text": "The [[hanbalani|hanbalani alta]] network in [[Riedra]] allows\nthe [[quori]] to broadcast telepathic messages to the [[people|Riedrans]] across wide\nareas. The effect can be narrowed to a single village or linked to broadcast across an entire\nsphere, but it cannot pinpoint individuals. The Voice\naddresses the populace throughout the day, providing\nnews, encouragement, and instruction to the people.\nThis system is controlled and monitored from [[Dal Quor]].\nThose who want to do so can cut off a village from the\nSoothing Voice by deactivating a nearby monolith, but\nthey cannot transmit messages of their own without going\nto Dal Quor.
