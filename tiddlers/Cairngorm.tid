Cairngorm is a [[nabassu]] [[gargoyle]] and the lord of [[Grimstone Keep]]. He holds the loyalty of a host of gargoyles that have long dominated the [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s
of the region. The [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] have placed
a troop of [[troll]]s under Cairngormâ€™s command, but
these servants are charged with watching the wily
gargoyle as much as assisting him.
