        "text": "This loose affiliation of [[Io'lokari]] weaponsmiths and armorsmiths resembles many of the crafter and artisan enclaves of the [[Freeward]]. Its residents live in palatial second- and third-floor apartments above well-appointed workshops whose anvils ring from morning\nto night.\n\nMany of the cityâ€™s crafter enclaves open their homes to visitors with demonstrable skill in the same areas. In addition, the smiths here trade their services for foreign arms and armor they have not seen before (including weapons of [[Xen'drik]] and [[Sarlona]]). Like most smiths in the city, members of this enclave work only on magic armor and weapons.",
