title: alchemist's loupe
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This small jeweler's eyepiece has 3 charges, which recharge daily at dawn. While looking
through it, you can expend one of its charges and detect [[transmutation]] magic for 10 minutes. While this effect is active, objects affected by transmutation magic are outlined in a faint aura when viewed through the loupe.
