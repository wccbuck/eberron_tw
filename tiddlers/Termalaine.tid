''Population:'' <<ntls>>

Founded by settlers from [[Tantamar]] who appreciated beauty, Termalaine is widely regarded as the most picturesque town in [[Orthoss]], spreading out from the shore of [[Maer Dualdon]] and bordered on the north by tall pines. For most visitors, the enchantment of the town is dispelled as soon as they feel the icy claws and teeth of the cold wind sweeping down from the east, shearing through their layers of clothing. Termalaine was built in the path of this dreadful gale, which continues well past the town to harry fishers on the southern half of the lake.

In addition to fishers, shipbuilders, and scrimshanders, Termalaine is home to miners who harvest gemstones from a cavern complex set into a low hill north and east of the settlement. Their efforts are hampered by dark-dwelling creatures that occasionally find their way up into the mine. Whenever such creatures are discovered, the mine is sealed off and the townsfolk wait until a band of sellswords or adventurers can be hired to clear it out.

The leader of Termalaine is Oarus Masthew, who was declared speaker after a close and contentious election. The child of [[half-orc]] adventurers, he was adopted by Shaelen Masthew, the previous speaker, who retired from her leadership role but still lives in Termalaine. Oarus is bright, with a sharp sense of humor, but he has political enemies in town and lacks the full support of the town militia.

!! Locations in Termalaine

The fishers of Termalaine typically finish their days at the dockside tavern ''The Sleeping Clam'', seated on benches near one of the building's long hearths to warm their feet while they fill their bellies with spiced chowder. Beautiful works of scrimshaw are hung on the walls. Vernon Braig, the tavern's owner and chef, knows some of the hunters and trappers in [[Lonelywood]], and occasionally a sled comes down the north trail with a sack of hares or a haunch of moose, courtesy of one of Vernon's friends. On those nights, the Sleeping Clam's hearths are full of roasting meat, and the patrons stay later and sing louder, enjoying the good times while they last. Characters who loiter in the tavern are likely to hear a local rumor or two.

''The Eastside'' is the inn where most visitors in town stay. What looks from the outside like separate houses turns out to be a single structure with rooms connected by underground passages, with cozy guest accommodations in the cellar. The innkeeper is Marta Peskryk, a willowy teenager who spends much of her time tending to her bedridden father, Clyde, a retired fisherman.

!! Adventure Hook

* ''//A Beautiful Mine.//'' Oarus, the town speaker, is offering a reward for anyone who clears out the gemstone mine, located half a mile northeast of Termalaine. Some [[kobold]]s have emerged from the depths, causing mining operations to halt. No one has yet been harmed, but the kobolds are too dangerous for the miners to deal with. The town militia refuses to take this task due to an ongoing feud with the speaker. When PCs enter the mine, they find the kobolds have been driven into upper caverns by a [[grell]] in the depths.
