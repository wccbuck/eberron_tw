        "text": "[[Stormreach]] has a thriving black market, more expansive than most cities three times its size. The market is called the Night Tide, a name dating from the days\nwhen smugglers came in with the night tide to sell their\nwares. Nearly everyone in the city relies on its services\non a daily basis.\n\nThe constant influx of [[dragonshard]]s, ancient relics, and other treasures from the [[continent|Xen'drik]]’s interior feed the underground market well. The luxuries and amenities brought legally into the city and tariffed by the [[Harbor Lord|Jonas Wylkes]] cannot fully satisfy the residents’ demands. In the Night Tide, [[Brelish|Breland]] sausages and [[Aundair]]ian fine wines can be purchased alongside [[Siberys shard|dragonshard]]s the size of a gnome’s head and sacrificial daggers\nused in blood rites over twenty thousand years ago.\n\nWhen the PCs are looking to buy illegal goods discreetly or fence loot from their latest adventure in [[Xen'drik]], the Night Tide is the way to go. The following persons work the Tide and can be found by any interested buyers or sellers who know who to ask.\n\n* [[Baudry Cartamon]]\n* [[Tyrl Gol Garin]]\n* [[Three-Fingered Thad]]",
