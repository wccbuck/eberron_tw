''Population:'' <<ntls>>

Set among the tallest peaks of the [[Ahnadiv Mountains]], Malshashar guards a major point in [[Adar]]'s defenses. Malshashar isn't as close to the foothills as
[[Shalquar]], but the fortress is named after a monastery that
once was. Even so, it has more to worry about in the form
of [[Riedra]]n patrols and potential spies than many other
strongholds. It faces Riedra proper and not the small
settlements on the frontier of the [[Andnemun Desert]] and
[[Syrkarn]]. The fortress is mainly under one mountain,
but it sprawls under two other peaks and connects to the
[[dromite]] city-hive of [[Zi'til'natek]] through [[psionic|psionics]] portals
that function within [[Shroud]] bubbles.

Life is harsh in Malshashar, where even the food must be grown underground. Regular storms and landslides make the surrounding territory hostile and impenetrable. Artificial walls have sealed passes for centuries, but [[magic|arcane magic]] and [[psionics]] make these walls look natural. A particularly discerning [[dwarf]] might be able to see their
real nature, but the dwarves of [[Sarlona]] live far away.

[[Kalashtar|kalashtar]] outnumber [[human]]s in Malshashar. Feeling it is their duty to defend the land of refuge in a war for which they are responsible, they handle all military matters in the stronghold. Supported by kalashtar [[psion]]s and martial artists, a few of the human monks of Malshashar live as they have for ages, some not overtly participating in the ongoing struggle. The kalashtar value
the meditations of these pacifist monks nonetheless.
