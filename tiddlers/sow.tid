This [[gleaner]] spell allows you to magically spread seeds across a region of arable land. For as long you maintain the spell (up to 1 minute), you can scatter seeds across 4 square feet every second. Through the magic of //sow//, the seeds sink to an optimum distance and are spread in the precise pattern you desire. These seeds must grow naturally, and seeds sown in barren land will not bear fruit.
