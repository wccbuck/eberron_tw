This short spear is made from the proboscis of a [[chasme]] and magically infused with abyssal spite. Any successful attack with this weapon deals additional [[necrotic damage|damage type]], and wounds caused by this weapon do not heal unless the target is affected by a spell such as greater [[restoration]] or [[remove curse]].
