This short spear is made from the proboscis of a [[chasme]] and magically infused with abyssal spite. Any successful attack with this weapon deals additional necrotic damage, and wounds caused by this weapon do not heal unless the target is affected by a spell such as greater [[restoration]] or [[remove curse]].
