A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within 60 feet. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point takes damage. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal takes extra damage. Nonmagical objects in the spell's area that aren't being worn or carried also take the damage.
