title: breath of Siberys

[[Arcane artillery|arcane artillery]] requires a powerful surge of magical energy
to fuel the attack. [[Wizards|wizard]] and other spellcasters can prime
arcane artillery by expending their own power, but bombardiers (specialized [[magewright]]s) don't always have that option. Instead, a bombardier charges
the weapon by using the //breath of Siberys//â€”a small globe
containing a highly refined solution of [[dragonshard]]s held in a
suspended state. While priming arcane artillery, the operator
crushes the breath of Siberys against an engraved brass plate;
the sphere dissolves and the weapon is charged.

House [[Cannith]] [[artificer]]s are working to adapt
other charged [[magic item]]s to use breath of Siberys.
