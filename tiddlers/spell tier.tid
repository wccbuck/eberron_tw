A {{!!spellname}}'s tier is a general indicator of how powerful and rare it is.

# ''Cantrip.'' A cantrip is a quick and simple spell that can be performed without a significant expenditure of energy. Ex: [[prestidigitation]], [[fire bolt]], [[mage hand]], [[light]].
# ''Common Spell.'' These spells require more effort or time to cast than cantrips. The people of Khorvaire are used to dealing with tools and services that mimic cantrips or common spells. Ex: [[knock]], [[alarm]], [[burning hands]], [[floating disk]], [[zone of truth]]. Common spells require the expenditure of 1 "spellcasting [[stress]]" to cast, and require filling a [[progress clock]] of size 2.
# ''Rare Spell.'' These spells are exceptionally potent, but aren't part of everyday life, and the typical commoner doesn't expect to run into them. Ex: [[fireball]], [[sending]], [[conjure elemental]], [[raise dead]], [[cloudkill]]. Rare spells require the caster to expend 2 stress, and require filling a [[progress clock]] of size 2.
# ''Legendary Spell''. These are magical incantations of mythical proportions, usually the product of more advanced civilizationsâ€”the [[dragon]]s of [[Argonnessen]], the [[elves|elf]] of [[Aerenal]], the ancient [[giant]]s of [[Xen'drik]]. Ex: [[resurrection]], [[plane shift]], [[simulacrum]], [[antimagic field]]. Legendary spells cost 2 stress to cast, require filling a [[progress clock]] of size 4, and usually can only be cast once or twice per day.
# ''Mythical Spell.'' Spells of never-before-seen power over the fabric of reality. Ex: [[wish]], [[true resurrection]], [[imprisonment]]. Mythical spells cost 3 stress to cast, require filling a [[progress clock]] of size 4, and usually can only be cast once or twice per week.

The "spellcasting stress" to cast a spell triggers for //each attempt to fill the casting [[progress clock]]//. So two attempts to fill a legendary spell progress clock will cost 4 stress total. Also, all of the "spellcasting stress" requirements above are //in addition to// any [[consequence]]s suffered from attempting to cast the spell. So a cantrip still might end up costing 1 stress on a [[partial success]].

These tiers roughly correspond to D&D 5e's spell levels: Common = 1st and 2nd level; Rare = 3-5th level (some 6th); Legendary = 6-8th level; Mythical = 9th level. 

Player characters who are able to cast spells (usually by taking the [[Spellcaster|Spellcaster (talent)]] [[talent]]) generally start with only the capability to cast cantrips and common-tier spells. With increasing skill, they can learn how to cast rare, legendary, and perhaps even mythical-tier spells. They may also obtain extra [[stress]] boxes that can only be used for spellcasting.

Some spell descriptions indicate how that spell can be cast at a higher tier. This is only permitted if your character has a [[talent]] (e.g. [[Spellcaster|Spellcaster (talent)]] or [[Arcane Tradition|Arcane Tradition (talent)]]), or some other boon that allows them to do so. Most spells can also be "upgraded" in this way, even if they don't have explicit instructions on what the upgraded spell looks like; when it doubt, just increase [[impact]].

Keep in mind that [[Storyloom]] is a fiction-first game. The rules work best when the spells' descriptions are used as a guideline for their effects, not as restrictions. Generally each spell tier should create an effect that's roughly +1d or +1 [[impact]] above that of the tier below it, but spell effects vary widely.

!! Magic Items and Spells

If a [[magic item]] grants a character the ability to cast a spell, but places a daily limit to the number of times the spell can be cast, that spell does ''not'' cost any stress to cast. The energy needed to cast the spell is stored (and slowly recharged) within the item itself. If there is no limit, that means the spell is simply added to your spell list and you must expend your own energy to cast it.

If an item grants a non-spellcaster access to a spell, they may still cast it using that item, but at a single [[disadvantage]].
