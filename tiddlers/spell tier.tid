In the [[Storyloom]] system, {{!!spellname}}s are categorized by tiers. A spell's tier is a general indicator of how powerful and rare it is, and how exhausting it is to cast.

# ''Common.'' A common-tier spell, also known as a ''cantrip'', is a quick and simple spell that can be performed without a significant expenditure of energy. Ex: [[prestidigitation]], [[fire bolt]], [[mage hand]], [[light]].
# ''Uncommon.'' These spells require more effort or time to cast than cantrips. The people of [[Khorvaire]] are used to dealing with tools and services that mimic cantrips or uncommon spells. Ex: [[knock]], [[alarm]], [[burning hands]], [[floating disk]], [[zone of truth]]. Uncommon spells require the expenditure of 1 "spellcasting [[stress]]" to cast.
# ''Rare.'' These spells are exceptionally potent, but aren't part of everyday life, and the typical commoner doesn't expect to run into them. Ex: [[fireball]], [[sending]], [[conjure elemental]], [[raise dead]], [[cloudkill]]. Rare spells require the caster to expend 2 stress.
# ''Epic.'' These are magical incantations of mythical proportions, usually the product of more advanced civilizationsâ€”the [[dragon]]s of [[Argonnessen]], the [[elves|elf]] of [[Aerenal]], the ancient [[giant]]s of [[Xen'drik]]. Ex: [[resurrection]], [[plane shift]], [[simulacrum]], [[antimagic field]]. Epic spells cost 3 stress to cast, and usually can only be cast once or twice per day.
# ''Legendary.'' Spells of never-before-seen power over the fabric of reality. Ex: [[wish]], [[true resurrection]], [[imprisonment]]. Legendary spells cost 4 stress to cast, and usually can only be cast once or twice per week.

The "stress" column indicates the amount of stress that must be expended to cast that spell. This "spellcasting stress" to cast a spell is //in addition to// any [[consequence]]s suffered from attempting to cast the spell. Even a cantrip still might end up costing 1 stress on a [[mixed success]]. Note that while earning a [[mixed success]] on a higher-tier spell might mean you need to make a second or third attempt to complete your casting, you only need to spend the spellcasting stress //once// per casting.

These tiers roughly correspond to D&D 5e's spell levels: Uncommon = 1st and 2nd level; Rare = 3-5th level (some 6th); Epic = 6-8th level; Legendary = 9th level. 

Player characters who are able to cast spells (usually by taking the [[Spellcaster]] [[talent]]) generally start with only the capability to cast common- and uncommon-tier spells. With increasing skill, they can learn how to cast rare, epic, and perhaps even legendary-tier spells. They may also obtain extra [[stress]] boxes that can [[only be used for spellcasting|Special Stress: Spellcasting]].

Some spell descriptions indicate how that spell can be cast at a higher tier. This is only permitted if your character has a [[talent]] (e.g. [[Spell Enhancement]] or [[Arcane Tradition]]), or some other boon that allows them to do so. Most spells can also be "upgraded" in this way, even if they don't have explicit instructions on what the upgraded spell looks like; when it doubt, just increase [[impact]].

!! Added Impact

Generally, each spell tier should create an effect that's roughly +1 or +2 [[impact]] above that of the tier below it. Cantrips typically don't automatically grant any extra impact; shooting a [[ray of frost]] is not intrinsically more impactful than loosing an arrow. Higher-tier spells typically do grant additional impact, but the exact degree is often context-specific. For example, in a battle scene against a group of enemies, a [[fireball]] might grant 4 extra impact if you are launching it at a close-packed group of enemy soldiers with no fire protection, but only 1 extra impact against a single target behind a wall. 

Keep in mind that [[Storyloom]] is a fiction-first game. The rules work best when the spells' descriptions are used as a guideline for their effects, not as restrictions.

!! Magic Items and Spells

If a [[magic item]] grants a character the ability to cast a spell, but places a daily limit to the number of times the spell can be cast, that spell does ''not'' cost any stress to cast. The energy needed to cast the spell is stored (and slowly recharged) within the item itself. If there is no limit, that means the spell is simply added to your spell list and you must expend your own energy to cast it.

If an item grants a non-spellcaster access to a spell, they may still cast it using that item, but at a single [[disadvantage]].
