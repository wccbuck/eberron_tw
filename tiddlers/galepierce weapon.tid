These magic weapons, which can take the form of any weapon designed to be thrown, have been tempered to glide through the wind, doubling their throwing ranges. When a target of such a projectile weapon is protected by some air-based hindrance such as fog or high winds, a galepierce weapon ignores such an obstacle and flies true.
