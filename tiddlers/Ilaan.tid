title: Ilaan
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Though only a child, Ilaan has an innate connection
to [[dreamspace]]â€”a gift that has given him wisdom beyond
his years and hardened his mind against the indoctrination of the Inspired. He can't control his dreaming, and
he rarely grasps the cryptic images he sees, but occasionally he wakes with a vital insight about the present or the
future, and he always feels obliged to act. These oracular
visions guided him to a local cell of the [[Unchained]], and
they might guide him to the PCs. In this way, if the characters are in desperate need of direction, this strangely
mature boy might approach them. Once the PCs have
encountered Ilaan, he might reach them in the future
using a [[dream of contact]].

It might be that Ilaan's youth has shielded him
from the eyes of the [[Inspired]]. Or it could be that his
"visions" are in fact dreams sent by one of [[Riedra]]'s
overlords, who is using the boy to guide the party down
a particular path.
