        "text": "Before the [[Mourning]], a spring in the eastern part\nof [[Cyre]] fed the Rushing River as it traced a short but\nfertile path south to [[Kraken Bay]]. The Rushing River is\nnow as dry and barren as the rest of the [[Mournland]],\nand the location of the spring is marked by the Crimson Water, a stagnant lake of blood-red water.\n\nThe shores of the Crimson Water are littered with the bones and corpses of animals and foolish travelers that have strayed into the [[Mournland]] and sought to slake their thirst with a drink from the lake. Its depths hold the ruined [[Cyran|Cyre]] town of Eastwood Springs, which once served as a resort town for the\nleisured classes of [[Cyre]]. But even [[Ikar's Salvage]] has not dared mount an expedition into the toxic waters to recover any treasures that may lie within\nthe ruins.\n\nDespite its toxic waters, however, the lake does support lifeâ€”of a sort. Water [[elemental]]s, their forms the same deep red as the Crimson Water, have been seen around the lake, particularly on the southern shore. Their purpose and origin are unknown.",
