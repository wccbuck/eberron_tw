This poison can take a variety of forms: a pasty concoction of a toxic cactus fruit; the oily sap of a noxious mushroom; or perhaps the venomous saliva of a foul beast. A basic poison can be coated on a weapon or secretly added to a victim's drink. After about 20 seconds, the target suffers a small amount of poison damage, and experiences disorientation or nausea that imposes [[disadvantage]] on all actions for the next few minutes.
