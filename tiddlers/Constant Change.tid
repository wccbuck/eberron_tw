title: Constant Change
tooltip: universal property: at irregular intervals, creatures' details change
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While on a [[plane]] with this property, nothing remains exactly the same for long. Every so often at irregular intervals, a creature finds that something changed about it or its possessions. Each player should describe what's changed about their character; this could be as simple as your cloak changing color or your sword now having a stylish [[Aundair]]ian design when it was originally [[Karrnath]]i. You could choose for the change to be physical—your skin, hairstyle, or sex—or mental—you suddenly hate olives or no longer believe in the [[Sovereign Host]]. These changes have no mechanical impact: the coins in your pocket may change in design, but copper coins won't turn into platinum. If you want a change to have mechanical impact—for example, if your [[cleric]]'s faith or race changes and you want your character sheet to reflect that—discuss the possibility with your GM.
