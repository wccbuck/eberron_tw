Patrons dine in an\nelaborate, two-story open-air pavilion, surrounded\nby the living trees from which the restaurant takes\nits name. The Oaks specializes in exotic [[Aerenal]]\ncuisine, but also serves a variety of traditional\n[[Brelish|Breland]] dishes, including pepper cider and spiced\ndaggertrout. The owner, [[Maza Thadian]], has served as head chef for over\n300 years, and is respected throughout the district\nfor her wisdom and common sense. Six years ago,\nMaza assumed the position of [[Councilor|Sharn Council]] for [[Upper Northedge]], and today she leaves most of the restaurant work to her sons, Meryn and Malys; however, she can still be coaxed to perform her culinary\nmiracles for special patrons.
