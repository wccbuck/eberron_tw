Succubi and incubi are lascivious dark-winged [[fiend]]s that can be found in service to more powerful entities, especially the [[Dark Power]]s of [[Mabar]]. Though legend speaks of them separately, any succubus can become an incubus, and vice versa. Most of these fiends do have a preference for one form or the other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in its true form, however, for the fiend typically begins its corruption in veiled, insidious ways.
