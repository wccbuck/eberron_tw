Most potions\nconsist of one ounce of liquid.\n\nPotions are consumable [[magic item]]s. Drinking a\npotion or administering a potion to another character usually takes a few seconds; applying an oil might take a few minutes, as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up.\n\n!!! <<showitem-type>>",
