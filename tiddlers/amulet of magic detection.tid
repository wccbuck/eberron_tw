title: amulet of magic detection
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This circular golden pendant has a teardrop-shaped hole in the center. The edges of the amulet are etched with strange runes.

Peering through the center of the amulet allows the user to see magical auras, much like the spell [[detect magic]], as long as the magical object or creature is within 30 feet.
