type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This gnarled staff is made from blackened ash. It is simple, but the wood is soft and oiled to a faint shine, and a leather loop is tied near the top.

While you wield this staff, you can [[push yourself]] to strike the staff on the floor, sending out a blast wave that knocks back all creatures within 20 feet.
