Lhazaaran (sometimes called "Old Common") is a creole language between [[Riedran]] and [[Common]], and is spoken in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] of [[Khorvaire]] as well as port cities along [[Sarlona]]'s west coast (including the foreign quarter of [[Dar Ulatesh]] in [[Rhiavhaar]], [[Riedra]]). The language also includes elements of old [[Khunanese]]. Though the name "Old Common" is somewhat inaccurate, the language is similar to the language spoken by [[Lhazaar]] [[human]] settlers to [[Khorvaire]]. It is used as a trade language on both sides of the [[Lhazaar Sea]], and is spoken in some neighborhoods in cities such as [[Korth]] and [[Adderport]]. In the broader [[Five Nations]], Lhazaaran is often perceived as "pirate talk", but it is a legitimate and complete language that many in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] speak as their only tongue.
