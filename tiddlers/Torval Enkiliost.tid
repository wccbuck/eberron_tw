Torval Enkiliost, [[dragonmark]]ed heir of an obscure branch of the [[Lyrandar]] family, leads a shadowy operation known as the Stormwalkers. Throughout the latter half of the [[Last War]], the Stormwalkers smuggled fugitives and spies to [[Stormhome]],
where they could attend clandestine meetings and engage in cloak-and-dagger activities on neutral ground. The intelligence that Torval gathered along the way kept House Lyrandar one step ahead of its rivals. Even though the war is over, many still pay handsomely for a secret voyage to Stormhome.
