The insatiable nabassus are gaunt, [[gargoyle]]-like [[demon]]s with a never-ending hunger for the souls of mortal creatures. Their connection to gargoyles is more than skin-deep, however. For reasons unclear even to the most clever sages of the [[plane]]s, nabassus are able to possess [[gargoyle]]s, but no other creature. It is possible that nabassus were once gargoyles themselves, but were corrupted by an [[overlord]]â€”perhaps [[Katashka]] or [[Sul Khatesh]].
