Many [[gargoyle]]s have [[fiend]]ish physical features, but they are [[elemental]] beings of living stone and are not vessels for demonic forces. Nabassus, on the other hand, are gargoyles which have been implanted with shards of [[demonglass]], infusing them with the essence of a true [[fiend]] and granting them terrifying infernal power. One such demonglass gargoyle, [[Cairngorm]], is the [[warlord]] of [[Grimstone Keep]] in [[Droaam]].
