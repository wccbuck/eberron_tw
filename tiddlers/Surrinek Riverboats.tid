title: Surrinek Riverboats
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Surrinek, a [[shifter]], has a near monopoly on the river taxi business in [[Stormreach]], which extends down the [[Koronoo River]] to the [[Harbor]]. She allows
the riverboat captains who work under her to operate
almost autonomously, as long as they divide the available customers equitably. The captains’ boats range
from gondolas to barges. Surrinek runs the business
from a stilted hut over the river in [[Whitewash]]. Boats can be tied up at
its base and are left there when they need repair.

The ablest captain on the city’s waterways, Surrinek grew up in [[Stormreach]] and knows the river and harbor like the back of her hand. She is a source of
information if she can be persuaded to part with it;
flattery is as much a weakness for her as coin.
