Each country in [[Khorvaire]] takes a slightly different attitude toward commerce and industry. Some governments, such as [[Breland]]'s, require all business owners to buy a business license of some sort, with the cost and difficulty of obtaining the license increasing depending on the value of the business and what danger it might pose to nearby people and property. Other nations, such as [[Zilargo]], take a more hands-off approach and allow most business to operate with minimal restrictions and interference. A business license consists of a simple parchment that must be displayed somewhere in the place of business, affixed with an [[arcane mark]] of the [[Notaries Guild]].

Typically, a town or city has a licensing office that issues business licenses and [[identification papers]]. Smaller settlements rarely have offices devoted to this alone, but magistrates issue licenses in addition to their other duties. It can take considerable time to process a license depending on the location and type of business.
