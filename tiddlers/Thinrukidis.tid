The master of the [[Black Stage]] in [[Io'lokar]] is Thinrukidis. Though he is one of the highest-level arcanists in the city, Thinrukidis’s prowess with [[illusion]] conceals a newfound fascination for the forbidden arts of [[necromancy]]. As elsewhere in [[Argonnessen]], active practice of the dark art is prohibited in [[Io'lokar]], and the city [[Masters|Master's Hall]] have no desire to antagonize the [[Conclave]] on this matter. Thinrukidis has ties to the necromantic cabal of the [[Shadowmasters]], and much of their lore is hidden in the private libraries of the [[gnome]]’s [[Sunward]] apartments, out of sight
of draconic agents.
