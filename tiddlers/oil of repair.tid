During the [[Last War]], the defenders of [[Cyre]] relied heavily on the use of [[warforged]] and other [[construct]]s, but it was impossible to have an [[artificer]] in
every unit. Oil of repair was developed to provide emergency
assistance to units protecting critical regions. This oil has an effect similar to the [[mending]] spell.
