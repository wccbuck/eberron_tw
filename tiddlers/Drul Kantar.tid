The charismatic [[oni]] mage Drul Kantar holds the lands around [[Thrakelorn]], ruling a host of [[orc]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[goblin]]s. Drul Kantar has neither the power nor the
ambition of the oni [[Tzaryan Rrac]], and he seems entirely loyal to the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]].

//"Gaze upon true wonder. Drulkalatar Atesh, the Feral Hand, Voice of the [[Wild Heart]]. Immortal and perfect, soldier of the [[first age|Age of Demons]] and the age to come."//

Drul Kantar is secretly a [[rakshasa]] agent of the [[Lords of Dust]]. Drulkalatar Atesh (his true name) is the [[chosen servant|prakhutu]] of the [[overlord]] known as the [[Wild Heart]]. He hopes to corrupt other warlords and convince them to join his causeâ€”and eventually, to release the Feral Master from its bonds and usher in an age of savagery.

Drulkalatar Atesh seems to wield power over [[therianthrope]]s, driving them to madness or forcing them to do his bidding.

During the time of the [[Silver Crusade]] almost 170 years ago, Drulkalatar Atesh was known by the moniker Drukan Moonlord.
