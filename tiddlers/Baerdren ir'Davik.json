        "text": "The Order of [[Templar|templar]]s of the [[Silver Flame]] is represented on the [[Council of Cardinals]] by High Cardinal Baerdren ir'Davik, who also holds the rank of Grand Master of the order. Baerdren is an exemplary templar, utterly dedicated to the mission of the order and often chafing at the political and bureaucratic responsibilities his position on the council demands of him. However, he considers his role a sacrifice worth making, for he fears that if he were to give up his seat on the council, it might go to his seneschal and rival, [[Ofejjaia]] of [[Korth]].",
