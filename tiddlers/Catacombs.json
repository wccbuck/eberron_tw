        "text": "Endless tunnels of gray stone wind through the Catacombs, the\ndestination of [[humanoid]] spirits. Some passages are painfully\ntight, while others widen into grand halls with ceilings lost in\ndarkness. The Dead are everywhere, [[shade]]s pleading for release,\n[[husk]]s keening in the shadows. The chambers of the Catacombs\nmight contain vast wells filled with moaning mist, or [[nalfeshnee]]s\nherding [[shade]]s into pens and scraping [[lemure]]s off the walls.\n\nThe Catacombs may be larger than [[Khorvaire]], or even\n[[Eberron]] itself. A mortal could wander forever through these\nwinding tunnels—at least until they're consumed by ennui.\nHowever, there are junction points that transcend the logic of\ndistance. If one knows the right symbols to follow, they can\ncross the vastness of the Catacombs quickly or pass to other\nlayers—perhaps in search of a shade to rescue.",
