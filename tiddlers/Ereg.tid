Mostly retired now, Ereg sponsors younger hunters seeking
entrance into the [[Lords of the Hunt]] in [[Stormreach]], supposedly in hope of bolstering the organizationâ€™s honored membership. His true intentions are more sinister. Bored with hunting mere animals and creatures, he now seeks cunning [[humanoid]] foes to hunt at his leisure. He takes up-and-coming hunters out on expeditions, only to stalk
and kill them. The hunter became obsessed with necromantic arts after discovering an old [[Qabalrin]] tome detailing [[necromantic|necromancy]] blood rites during an excursion in [[Xen'drik]], and now he enjoys animating his dead enemies to serve him. He
keeps a grim cave of his [[undead]] trophies in a mazelike area of canyons over a hundred miles from [[Stormreach]]. He often visits the canyons, claiming the dry air there does wonders for his constitution. [[Vanson|Vanson ir'Lain]] joins Ereg
on a few of his special hunts when the prey includes
one or more [[shifter]]s. The two keep their expeditions
secret, since exposure would no doubt cause their
expulsion from the [[Lords|Lords of the Hunt]].
