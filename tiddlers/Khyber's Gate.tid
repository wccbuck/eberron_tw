''District Type:'' Undercity<br/>
''Buildings: ''Dungeons (8), temples ([[Dragon Below|Cults of the Dragon Below]], the [[Shadow]], the [[Mockery]], the [[Fury]]), poor lodging (20), poor food (40), average
trades (20), poor trades (60), average services (20),
poor services (80), poor residences (420)<br/>
''First Impression:'' This is an actual city beneath the
city, with homes and shops carved into the walls of the
[[Cogs]]. It is still a maze of passages, but the “streets” are
a little wider and the ceilings rise higher. The heat is
far less intense that in the industrial district, but the
air is still filled with the stench of smoke and garbage.
[[Goblin|goblin]]s watch from the shadows, and in the distance
two [[ogre]]s stagger out of a bar, arguing in [[Gutterspeak]].<br/>
''Social Class:'' Lower class

[[Khyber]]'s Gate covers the distance between [[Ashblack]]
and [[Blackbones]]. Due to the lack of lava streams, it does
not have any of the heavy industry found to the east or
west. For the most part, Khyber's Gate is a tenement
district, filled with tiny houses carved into the tunnel
walls. A great many of the monstrous immigrants from
[[Droaam]] have settled in Khyber's Gate, using strength
or supernatural abilities to drive the original residents
away. Beyond these monsters, the vast majority of the
inhabitants are [[goblin]]s. The other inhabitants of the
Gate are drawn from all races, though they share a
common desperation; an [[elf]] resident of Khyber's Gate
has little in common with one of the haughty inhabitants of [[Shae Lias]]. Many of the non-goblin inhabitants of the region are criminals who have fled from justice.
Some people have established businesses in the depths,
while others travel up to the surface and make a living
by begging or stealing. While the vast majority of the
trades and services offered in Khyber's Gate are illegal, there are a few people who practice useful mundane trades. Khyber's Gate is a community of sorts,
and brewers, tailors, and cooks are just as valuable
as burglars and assassins.

Khyber's Gate is an extremely disorganized
region. There is no central authority—it is simply a
question of who has the power to enforce their desires.
At the moment, [[Daask]] is the most powerful force in
the undercity. The [[Cults of the Dragon Below]] have a
strong following in the undercity, but as is often the
case, the cults are not a unified force; there are three
different sects, and they fight one another as often as
anyone else. The [[rakshasa]]s [[Zathara]] and [[Nethatar]]
are powerful and deadly inhabitants of the region,
but few people even know of their existence.

Khyber's Gate is part of the ruins of a goblin city that was abandoned thousands of years ago. No one knows how deep it goes. The monstrous inhabitants of the district have no love for treasure hunters or adventurers, and it's a dangerous place to explore.

In Khyber's Gate, an adventurer should always be
cautious—there's no telling when what appears to be a
lowly [[goblin]] might turn out to be a [[vampire]], a [[wererat]],
a [[rakshasa]], or an even more dangerous [[fiend]].

!! Noteworthy Locations

* [[Shamukaar]]. This is the most successful tavern in Khyber's Gate. The place is a safe haven for all within it, regardless of species or politics; once you make it through the door, you can breathe easy.
* The [[Wounded Dragon]]. A small shop located behind Shamukaar, as well as the abode of the [[changeling]] [[artificer]] [[Mig]].
* The [[Temple of the Six]]. A temple to the [[Dark Six]] and headquarters of [[Daask]].
* The [[Citadel of the Closed Circle]]. Over 200 years ago, the last surviving members of the destroyed [[arcane order]] known as the [[Closed Circle]] were sealed in the order's fortress in the undercity.
* The [[Workshop of Tyrial Dashar]]. This former workshop of a [[wizard]] is now a fortress inhabited by two [[rakshasa]]s working on behalf of the [[Lords of Dust]].
