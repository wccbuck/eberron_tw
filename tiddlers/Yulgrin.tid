Yulgrin is a [[brass|brass dragon]] [[rogue dragon]] in [[Xen'drik]]. Yulgrin’s
mother was driven insane in a cursed [[Age of Giants]] ruin, slew his father, then abandoned the wyrmling brass dragon. Yulgrin fends for himself among the dangerous predators of [[Menechtarun|Menechtarun Desert]], doing his best to guard his parents’ other five eggs. It is only a matter of time before [[Shendroa]] discovers the nest and devours Yulgrin’s unborn siblings.
