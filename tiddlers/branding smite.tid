The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends (up to 1 minute later), the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals extra [[radiant damage|damage type]] to the target, which becomes visible if it's invisible, and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can't become invisible until the spell ends.
