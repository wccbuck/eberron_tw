title: dimension door oil
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This bronze-hued oil can cover one door (3 ft x 7 ft or smaller), and takes 10 minutes to apply. The door becomes a magical portal which opens into a point you choose within 500 feet, similar to the spell [[dimension door]]. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward" or "upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet." The effect lasts for 1 hour.
