''Population:'' <<ntls>>

Deep in the awe-inspiring canyons where the
impassable [[Xaryai River]] in [[Adar]] flows, a forest occupies the
chasm's floor. The river has cut a wider opening through
softer stone, creating a shaded valley and revealing luminescent crystal that bathes the area in almost eternal twilight. In this weird jungle of crystal and trees live the
[[xeph]]s. Xephs have long been accepted among [[Adarans]].
The largest concentration of xephs in the Xaryai Coulee,
as the xephs name the valley, is in a settlement of graceful
buildings melding stone, tree, and crystal. Xephs call it
Xephanan. From Xephanan, xephs travel all over [[Adar]];
many are integrated into Adaran society and involved in
the war against the [[Inspired]]. A few bold xeph merchants
run trading vessels from the port at [[Dvaarnava]], where
they also work with the [[Summit Road]].
