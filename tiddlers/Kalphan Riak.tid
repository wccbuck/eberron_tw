Kalphan Riak is an example of [[Khorvaire]]’s new
breed of nobility. Not descended from a noble family
or a [[dragonmarked house]], Riak made his fortune in
the arms trade during the [[Last War]], putting his business savvy and his innate magical ability together to make enormous profit through sometimes unscrupulous deals. His tremendous wealth has earned him a mansion at the top of Andith Tower (just on the edge of the [[Mithral Tower]] district in [[Sharn]]), with open pavilions, sprawling quarters, and even a small garden growing on the towertop. He is also the high priest of the [[Korranath|Korranath (temple)]], a grand temple to [[Kol Korran]]. Riak has investments throughout the city and controlling interests in six of Sharn’s ten banks. Perhaps more importantly, he is a member of the [[Aurum]]’s Platinum Concord, and conspires with his fellow
Aurum members to ensure maximum profitability for their business ventures while inserting their fingers into every possible aspect of commerce in [[Sharn]] and greater [[Breland]].
