Barbed wire wraps around the tall fences, and the tall central spire is topped by a large brass bell framed by arches.\n\nThe Karvasi Asylum for the Criminally Insane's more common moniker of \"Hell's Heart\" is attributed to its inmates. Vicious killers with the blood of dozens of innocents on their hands, deranged madmen whose rampages left entire districts soaked in gore, sit in 10-by-10 cells with no windows.\n\nA tall, imposing man named Dr. [[Lucard Karvasi]] runs the asylum, completely unsupervised.\n\n!!
