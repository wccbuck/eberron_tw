The Seven Caves, as the [[Dhakaani|Heirs of Dhakaan]] and [[Marguul]] clans call them, consist of seven huge vaults\nthat seem to be magically dug from the living stone of the\nmountain. From the First Chamber that can be reached\nfrom a cave opening high in the mountain, to the Seventh\nChamber that plunges toward the very bowels of the world,\nthe Seven Caves are wondrous and awe-inspiring. Inside\neach strangely shaped cavern, amazing patterns resembling [[dragonmark]]s glow and swirl across the walls, floors, and ceilings. Each cave, in theory, reveals a different series of omens and portents, but few among the [[goblinoid]]s have the courage to\nbrave these sacred vaults to study them. Anyone who does\nattempt to enter the Seven Caves must contend with the\n[[wyvern]] colonies that regularly use them to nest and raise\ntheir young.", "modified": "20210727192030460", "tags": "Darguun dungeon", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "article": "the ", "category": "location", "color": "#3B5C0A", "points": "30.96,-0.75", "style": "{\"color\": \"#40262D\"}"}
