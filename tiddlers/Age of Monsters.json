        "text": "//Period: 10,000–3,000 years ago//\n\nDuring the Age of Monsters, history recounts that...\n\n* [[Elf|elf]] refugees fleeing the devastation of [[Xen'drik]] settled in [[Aerenal]], birthing the [[Undying Court]], the [[Aereni]], and the [[Tairnadal]].\n* [[Goblin|goblinoid]]s and [[orc]]s dominated [[Khorvaire]], while [[dwarves|dwarf]], [[dragonborn]], [[gnome]]s, and [[halfling]]s had a smaller presence and impact on the continent.\n* The [[goblinoid]] Empire of [[Dhakaan]] flourished for two thousand years, then was destroyed when the [[daelkyr]] invaded the Material Plane. Though the daelkyr were defeated, their seeds of madness destroyed the goblinoid civilization.\n* The daelkyr conflict destroyed the [[dwarven|dwarf]] [[Realm Below]].\n\nAfter [[Xen'drik]] was shattered by the [[dragon]]s, they remained\nisolated in [[Argonnessen]]. [[Human|human]] civilization was slowly\ntaking shape on [[Sarlona]], but the most dynamic cultures of\nthis period were forming on and around the continent of\n[[Khorvaire]]. The [[elves|elf]] founded a new homeland on [[Aerenal]]—“[[Aeren]]'s rest” in [[Elvish|Aerenese]]—instituting the [[Undying Court]] and\nestablishing the cultures that would become the [[Aereni]]\nand the [[Tairnadal]]. On [[Khorvaire]], the [[goblinoid]]s rose to\nprominence, founding the Empire of [[Dhakaan]] approximately\n6,300 years ago. Over the course of the next two thousand\nyears, it expanded to dominate all of central [[Khorvaire]]. The\nDhakaani slowly drove all of their competitors to the fringes—the mountains, the wastes, the marches. They clashed with\nthe [[dragonborn]] of what's now [[Q'barra]], the [[dwarves|dwarf]] of the\n[[Realm Below]], and [[Tairnadal]] explorers, but none could stop\nthe advance of Dhakaan.\n\nHowever, when the [[daelkyr]] led armies of [[aberration]]s through\nportals from [[Xoriat]], the Empire of [[Dhakaan]] was shattered—along with the [[Realm Below]], the vast subterranean civilization of the dwarves.\n\nThough this bitter conflict came to an end when Dhakaani\nchampions and [[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]] [[druid]]s sealed the [[daelkyr]] in\n[[Khyber]], the damage inflicted was irreparable. In addition to\ncreating monsters such as [[dolgaunt]]s and [[doppelganger]]s, the\ndaelkyr unleashed more subtle curses and strains of madness.\n[[One of these|Kapaa'vola]] eroded the connection to the [[goblinoid]]s' [[shared dream|Uul Dhakaan]] that united Dhakaani civilization. Within generations, the ancient empire collapsed into civil war. Cults and cruelty spread among the goblinoids, and soon, all that remained on the surface of [[Khorvaire]] were ruins and chaos.\n\n''Important Note:'' All dates in the Eberron TW older than 1300 years ago have been changed from canon in this document, to shorten the timeline.

Abbreviated Timeline\n\n| !Year|!Event |\n| -9,000|The [[giant]]s of [[Xen'drik]] revert to primitive monsters living in the ruins of their shattered civilization as the [[dragon]]s return to their [[secluded continent|Argonnessen]] and the [[elves|elf]] settle [[Aerenal]]. Meanwhile, on [[Khorvaire]], the first of the [[goblinoid]] kingdoms rises in the region that will one day become [[Breland]] and [[Darguun]]. |\n| -8,000|The [[Undying Court]] appears in [[Aerenal]]. First skirmish between the [[elves|elf]] and the [[dragon]]s, which sets a pattern of long periods of peace punctuated by [[devastating battles|Elf-Dragon Wars]] every few hundred years. |\n| -6,300|The [[Dhakaan]]i unite the [[goblinoid]] nations of [[Khorvaire]] to create a mighty empire. The [[Gatekeepers]] appear among the [[orc]]s of western [[Khorvaire]], and are taught [[druidic magic|primal magic]] by the [[dragon]] [[Vvaraak]]. |\n| -5,700|The golden age of the Empire of [[Dhakaan]] begins, lasting until the [[Xoriat]] incursion approximately 1000 years later. |\n| -5,400|The first [[dwarves|dwarf]] appear in the [[Ironroot Mountains]], a period they refer to as \"[[the Exile|Mror History]].\" |\n| -4,900|[[Aerenal]] [[elves|elf]] establish a colony in what is now [[Valenar]]. They come into conflict with the [[Dhakaan]]i, and eventually abandon the colony when another clash with the [[dragon]]s threatens [[Aerenal]]. |\n| -4,700|The [[daelkyr]] emerge in the western reaches of [[Khorvaire]] and begin their experiments. The incursion escalates into a war, and the [[orc]] and [[goblinoid]] populations of Khorvaire are decimated. Eventually the [[Gatekeepers]] are able to seal away the [[daelkyr]] and contain the threat. |\n| -4,600|The greatpine [[Oalian]] and the other [[guardian tree]]s are awakened—some say by the [[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]] [[druid]]s, others by [[Vvaraak]] herself. Over time, Oalian becomes recognized as the Great Druid, a spiritual authority respected by all the druids of the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. |\n| -3,400|Weakened by the war with the [[daelkyr]], and cursed by the [[Kapaa'vola]], the Empire of [[Dhakaan]] is shattered by infighting and civil strife, eventually leading to the collapse of the [[goblinoid]] civilization. |\n\n!! Why Does It Matter?\n\n[[Dhakaan]]i ruins are scattered across [[Khorvaire]]. Most major\ncities of the modern age are built on Dhakaani foundations,\nand there are tunnels and warrens beneath them that have\nbeen largely ignored by the human inhabitants. A Dhakaani\nruin could be viewed as a simple dungeon, but these are the\nremnants of a proud civilization; what an adventurer sees\nmerely as a useful magical weapon could be an important\ncultural relic of the goblins. While the Empire wasn't as\nadvanced as the civilizations of giants that came before,\nthe daashor [[artificer]]s of Dhakaan produced remarkable artifacts and were\nmaster weaponsmiths with a remarkable understanding of\n[[adamantine]] and other exotic alloys.\n\nThis is the story that underlies both the rise of [[Darguun]]\nand the recent emergence of the [[Heirs of Dhakaan]]. Before\nthe arrival of humanity, [[goblin|goblinoid]]s and [[orc]]s shaped the destiny\nof the continent, and there are many who yearn to reclaim\nthat ancient glory.\n\nThough it occurred thousands of years ago, the impact of the [[daelkyr]] incursion is still felt across [[Khorvaire]]. The [[Cults of the Dragon Below]] and the [[Gatekeeper|Gatekeepers]] [[druid]]s are active legacies of this conflict. The [[Mror|Mror Holds]] [[dwarves|dwarf]] are venturing into the ruined [[Realm Below]] and recovering daelkyr [[symbiont]]s and other relics. While the daelkyr remain sealed—and scheming—in [[Khyber]], adventurers could stumble upon ancient fortifications, an organic daelkyr vault, or some other remnant of this forgotten war.\n\n!! Character Ideas\n\nWhether your character is a [[goblinoid]], [[orc]], or a more recent\ninhabitant of these lands, consider these ways the Age of\nMonsters might inform your past and your future:\n\n* As a character from the [[Shadow Marches]], you carry an heirloom amulet you've sworn to keep safe. Have you learned that it's part of the wards that bind the [[daelkyr]] in [[Khyber]]—and that cultists bound to a particular daelkyr will be hunting you, trying to destroy the amulet?\n* You're obsessed with the early history of [[Khorvaire]] and are always searching for leads on ancient [[Dhakaan]]i ruins and [[daelkyr]] relics. Are you a city [[goblin]] or [[Tharashk]] [[half-orc]] searching for your roots? Or just a scholar of another race that's fascinated with the period?\n* As a [[Dhakaan]]i [[goblinoid]] you are an advance scout for a Dhakaani [[kech]]. Were you sent to reclaim lost Dhakaani artifacts, or are you studying the people of the surface, identifying weaknesses, and considering if any are worthy allies?\n* You possess a Dhakaani weapon, claimed by your ancestor and handed down through your family. There is power in the blade, but it only flows through a bearer when they prove worthy... and you haven't. Can you master the blade? And what will happen when you encounter the [[Heirs of Dhakaan]]?",
