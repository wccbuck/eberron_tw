        "text": "Formerly of the [[Library of Korranberg]] in [[Zilargo]],\nProfessor Ingrim Jod Jarell is a thin, bespectacled [[gnome]] with\nrather severe facial features (and a temperament to match). A dedicated leader within the [[Crimson Codex]], she served for many years as one of [[Khorvaire]]’s\nleading scholars on the history of magic in [[Xen'drik]] and [[Sarlona]].\n\nHer identity as an operative of the Codex was compromised, however, when she risked an unwise collaboration with the [[Lords of Dust]] to secure a [[schema]] in the heart of the [[Mournland]]. Summarily dismissed from the Library and pursued by several wronged parties, Jarell fled to [[Stormreach]] where she was taken in and sheltered by her true colleagues.\n\nJarell now remains almost entirely underground,\nliterally and figuratively, protected by the [[Codex|Crimson Codex]]’s\nintricate network of influence in [[Stormreach]]. She is\nstill a formidable scholar, and virtually every artifact\nthe Codex acquires in [[Xen'drik]] crosses her desk at\nsome point. Her knowledge of ancient magic is vast,\nand anyone looking to obtain particularly obscure\ninformation would do well to consult her.",
