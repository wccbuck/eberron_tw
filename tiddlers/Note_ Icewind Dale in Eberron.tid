type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Many of the details about [[Orthoss]] you see in this document, including all of Ten-Towns and associated locations and people, are adapted from the 5e adventure module [[Rime of the Frostmaiden|https://dnd.wizards.com/products/icewind-dale-rime-frostmaiden]]. Orthoss is Keith Baker's recommended location for playing this adventure path. He also recommends making Auril either a lesser lieutenant fiend of an [[overlord]] (but not an overlord herself), or perhaps a native [[archfey]] if you don't want her to be irredeemably evil.
