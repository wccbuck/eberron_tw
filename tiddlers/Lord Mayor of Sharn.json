The Lord Mayor represents the interests of\nSharn in any direct contact with the [[Brelish|Breland]] Crown,\nincluding interaction with the [[King's Citadel]]. He\nalso appoints the lesser officers of the city and oversees all issues of daily administration. He has the power to establish trade agreements with foreign governments, to [[pardon]] criminals, and to order arrests and even executions. His worship ''Cathan ir'Demell'' has been Lord Mayor of Sharn for twenty years, and he enjoys the luxuries and privileges of his position. He is unlikely to take any actions that would anger [[Javan Tomollan]] or [[Bestan ir'Tonn]], his strongest supporters in the council, and he\nusually consults with these two before making any\nmajor decisions.",
