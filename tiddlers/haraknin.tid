Those who donâ€™t understand the true nature of haraknins often incorrectly identify them as fiendish [[therianthrope]]s. The haraknin is not a true werecreature; it is a [[hell hound]] that has learned to assume [[humanoid]] form. Created by [[devil]] lords of the [[legion|legion of Shavarath]] of [[Tyranny]] to serve as intelligent trackers and guardians in the [[City of Knives]], haraknin sometimes are pulled to the Material Plane to undertake diabolical missions for the [[warlock]]s who summon them.

A haraknin can assume a variety of appearance with its alternate form, but it often favors [[human]]s or [[half-orc]]s with hair the color of flame, smoldering red eyes, and wiry rust-colored hair all over its body. A faint smell of brimstone clings to its [[humanoid]] form, and it tends to be ill-tempered and violent.
