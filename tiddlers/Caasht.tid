The [[gnoll]] Caasht runs a small [[dreamlily]] den in one of the tenements of [[Tumbledown]] in [[Sharn]]. A small band of gnolls backed by [[Daask]] provides security for the den. This is a direct challenge to the [[Boromar Clan]]'s control of dreamlily distribution, but so far the Boromars have not struck back.
