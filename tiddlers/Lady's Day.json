        "text": "The Lady's Day is an unusual annual observance in [[Sharn]]. Warning bells toll in the morning, people wear plague masks or strips of cloth over their mouths, and [[Jorasco]] healers roam the streets offering free examinations and blessings. This isn't the outbreak of disease it appears to be; it's how [[Sharn]] observes the La­dy's Day, commemorating a tragedy 1500 years in the past.\n\nAn army of [[aberrant dragonmark]]ed heirs made their home in [[Sharn]] in the\nearly days of the city, led by [[Halas Tarkanan]]—known\nas the Earthshaker—and the [[Lady of the Plague]], who\nhad power over vermin and [[disease]]. When the [[dragonmarked house]]s laid siege to the city and the aberrants' defeat\nbecame inevitable, the two unleashed their full might in the [[War of the Mark]].\nTarkanan's power reduced the early towers to rubble, and the Lady of the Plague called forth a horde of\ndisease-infested vermin.\n\nFor centuries afterward, the region was shunned.\nWhen the modern city was built, the [[cursed ruins|Old Sharn]] were\nsealed away. But one never knows when the darkness\ncould rise up again. On the Lady's Day, residents of the city remember\nthe tragedy that once befell [[Sharn]], and prepare for\nthe possibility that it could happen again.",
