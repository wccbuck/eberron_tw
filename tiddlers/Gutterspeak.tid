The self-deprecating name that speakers pick for this [[language]] disguises its impressive utility and the subtle threat that it poses to the [[human]] hierarchies of the [[Five Nations]]. In the [[Cogs]] of [[Sharn]] and in low-class neighborhoods of other cities of [[Khorvaire]], displaced and disenfranchised populations of [[goblinoid]]s and other "monstrous" races such as [[ogre]]s, [[minotaur]]s, and [[gnoll]]s band together. They bridge their language barriers with a language forged primarily from [[Goblin]], with pieces of [[Gnoll]], [[Yipyak]], long-forgotten [[Orcish]] dialects, and even [[Deep Speech]].
