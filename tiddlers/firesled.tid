Similar in principle to an [[elemental]] [[airship]], a firesled is a
small flying vessel used by the [[Sulatar]] of [[Xen'drik]].

A firesled is a slender, 9-foot-long sled
of [[darkwood]] inlaid with [[firebrass|orichalcum]]. A ring of fire wraps around the stern. A
short staff set just before the ring is attached to a movable mount that allows it to be aimed in any upward or lateral direction. The staff can also be used to fire a [[scorching ray]]. The pilot lies prone, stretched out along the sled. A second passenger can stand in front of the ring, bracing against the mounted staff. 

A firesled is controlled by the thoughts of the pilot. A [[Sulatar]] can control the sled without difficulty; other characters must enforce their control over the [[elemental]]-enhanced sled as if controlling any other [[elemental vessel]]. The sled can travel through the air at a speed of 25 mph with good maneuverability.
