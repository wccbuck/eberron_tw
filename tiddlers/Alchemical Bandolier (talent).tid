title: Alchemical Bandolier (talent)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You are always prepared for any situation in which an [[alchemical|alchemist]] item might be useful. Twice per day, when appropriate to the narrative, you may reach into your bandolier (or belt, or satchel) and pull out a single-use, common [[rarity]] item with the [[tool]], [[alchemical explosive]], [[poison]], or [[potion]] tag. You can pull out other items at the GM's discretion. You do not have to spend any [[money]] to pull out an item or restock your bandolier.
