        "text": "The Faded Forest is a forest in central [[Breland]], home to rare trees of [[alchemical|alchemist]] interest such as dragonseye and ghost oak. Travelers generally avoid this sizable stretch of woodland, though citizens of nearby [[Mistmarsh]] send an expedition to gather magical acorns from this forest once a year.\n\nMost of the trees of the forest have pale bark and leaves so dark they appear almost black. The ground slopes gently down to the southeast, until the forest drops into the bogs of Mistmarsh. The last 20 miles is made up of trees that have drowned in the slowly expanding mash, and their bone-like remains thrust into the sky. \n\nIn the center of the drowned trees, a huge arch has been constructed of rough bleached wood. Who constructed the arch is unknown, but it seems to date back to the old [[Dhakaani Empire|Dhakaan]]. Those who touch the arch fall sick within minutes.",
