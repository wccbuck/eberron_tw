As she taught, she discovered a tribe of [[orc]]s that already possessed a strong bond to magic and nature. Vvaraak told the Uraash that they were blessed by [[Eberron]] herself, and even as she trained the first [[Gatekeepers]] she helped the Uraash hone their gift of [[sorcery|sorcerer]]. The Uraash orcs played a major role in the war with the [[daelkyr]] during the [[Age of Monsters]], but their line was nearly eradicated in the process.\n\nToday, most of the people of the [[Shadow Marches]] believe the Uraash are no more than legend. A few of these orcs survived, however, and over the centuries, the tribe has rebuilt itself in the shadows of the swamps. Today the Uraash orcs remain in hiding, but their sorcerer-barbarians still battle the [[Cults of the Dragon Below]] and other forces of darkness.",
