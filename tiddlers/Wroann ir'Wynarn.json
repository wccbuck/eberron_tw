King [[Jarot|Jarot ir'Wynarn]]’s youngest\ndaughter, Wroann was the exact opposite of her twin\nbrother, [[Wrogar|Wrogar ir'Wynarn]] of [[Aundair]]. She was thin and agile, serious,\nand a lover of the finer things in life. She also cherished\nfreedom above all things, and promised to make Breland\na place where people would be judged by word and deed\ninstead of social class.\n\nWhen Jarot died, Wroann broke with her twin regarding the line of succession. Instead of supporting [[Mishann|Mishann ir'Wynarn]] of [[Cyre]]’s claim to the throne, Wroann gathered her vassals and declared her own intention to rule the kingdom.\nIronically, the freedom-loving nation of [[Breland]] was one\nof the key instigators of the [[Last War]], for her leader wanted\nto spread her ideas of liberty and increased democracy to\nall by force and sword.",
