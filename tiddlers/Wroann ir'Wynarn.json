King [[Jarot|Jarot ir'Wynarn]]’s youngest\ndaughter, Wroann was the exact opposite of her twin\nbrother, [[Wrogar|Wrogar ir'Wynarn]] of [[Aundair]]. She was thin and agile, serious,\nand a lover of the finer things in life. She also cherished freedom above all things, and promised to make Breland a place where people would be judged by word and deed instead of social class.\n\nWhen Jarot died, Wroann broke with her twin regarding the line of succession. Instead of supporting [[Mishann|Mishann ir'Wynarn]] of [[Cyre]]’s claim to the throne, Wroann gathered her vassals and declared her own intention to rule the kingdom.\nIronically, the freedom-loving nation of [[Breland]] was one\nof the key instigators of the [[Last War]], for her leader wanted\nto spread her ideas of liberty and increased democracy to\nall by force and sword. \n\nThe [[Breland Parliament]] supported Wroann's break from [[Galifar]] and helped raise armies to defend Brelish lands during the long years of war. Less than a year later, in [[895 YK|Khorvaire calendar]], Wroann granted greater powers to the Parliament, elevating it from an advisory position and granting it the authority it has today.",
