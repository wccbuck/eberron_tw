        "text": "Lord Kaltaresh, Keeper of Seals, is a [[du'ulora]] [[Inspired]] and the supreme commander of the [[Edgewalkers]] of [[Riedra]]. He guides the Edgewalkers from the division headquarters in the bastion of [[Dar Mun]].\n\nKaltaresh (in a long-dead vessel) organized the soldiers who opposed the [[Nulakesh]] incursion in 390 Unity (88 YK). Thus, among the Edgewalkers, he is known as \"the First.\"\n\nThe Keeper of Seals is especially powerful and cunning for a\n[[du'ulora]]. Two thousand years ago, he was one of the commanders in the battle against the [[quori]] who eventually became the [[kalashtar]], and he learned much of\nthe [[plane]]s during this hunt. He hates the kalashtar and\nbelieves that the followers of the [[Path of Light]] must be\ndestroyed. However, Kalataresh is one of the few [[quori]]\nof the age who is not cruel by nature. He does what he must\nto protect his people, but he does not savor violence. He is truly concerned with\nthe stability of [[Eberron]] and disturbed by the [[Mourning]],\nbelieving the fate of the quori to be linked to Eberron.\n\nFor now Kaltaresh follows the guidance of the [[Dreaming Dark]], but he could ally with Lady [[Sharadhuna]] if she opposes the [[Devourer of Dreams]].",
