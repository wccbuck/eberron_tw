A quiet trapper and hunter, Agalmar is a lean, sandy-haired fellow, 31 years of age. He lives in [[Larnsville]], [[Breland]], in the [[Harkenwold]] county.

!! During the [[Reavers of Harkenwold|The Reavers of Harkenwold]] Adventure

[[Larnsville]] reeve [[Madera Lirr]] has no desire for a fight against the [[Iron Circle]]. Agalmar has taken up the rebels' cause in his stead. The woodsman doesn't say much, but when he does, he speaks his mind and tells the truthâ€”if that gets someone's dander up, so be it.

Agalmar may provide help for the <<navAndScrollToHeader "The Reavers of Harkenwold" "Waylay the Caravan">> encounter.
