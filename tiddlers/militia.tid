A militia is a military force that is raised from the civil population to supplement a regular army in an emergency. Alternatively, a militia is any private force not necessarily directly supported or sanctioned by a government.

!! Militias of Stormreach

Life is cheap on the edge of [[Xen'drik]], and the only way to ensure a safe future is to have a weapon close at hand. Throughout the history of [[Stormreach]], many ethnic and religious groups have formed militias—people ready to defend their friends and neighbors from any threats.

Whereas gangs like the [[Bilge Rats]] and [[Golden Lions]] are
largely driven by greed, the militias of Stormreach are
bound together by political or religious agendas. Even
as they fight against their enemies, most of the militias
work to defend their wards from gangs and criminals.
The people of [[Whitewash]] are grateful for the presence of
the [[Ninth Wands]], and [[Grindstone]]’s residents regard the
[[Swords of Karrn]] with a mixture of fear and respect.

Militias provide a GM with an opportunity to pull
adventurers into the conflicts within [[Stormreach]] and
to draw on their ties to the [[Last War]]. If a PC [[wizard]]
served in the [[Aundair]]ian army, the [[Ninth Wands]] might
appeal to her patriotism and demand her assistance in
an upcoming strike against the [[Knights of Thrane]].
[[Dannel's Wrath]] presents a dilemma for [[Cyrans|Cyre]]; does
their love for their fallen country justify their deadly
acts? Beyond this, the militias also oppose criminal
adventurers. The [[Stormreach Guard]] won’t pursue a PC
who kills a blacksmith. But if that blacksmith lives in
[[Grindstone]], the [[Swords of Karrn]] avenge his death.

The militias don’t provide a picture of the typical inhabitants of [[Stormreach]]. Many of the soldiers are veterans of elite units, and [[Drago Thul]] and the
[[Dragonhawk]] were heroes of the [[Last War]]. Beyond the
exceptional skills of their soldiers, the militias have
the sympathy of the inhabitants of their wards, and
this support can be a valuable weapon.
