A [[halfling]] hero of the [[Talenta Plains]], Calazar Tash is said to have lived in the first days of the kingdom of [[Galifar]]. There are hundreds of tales of Calazar's exploits, and with the aid of his clever [[clawfoot]] Shurka he is said to have battled [[dragon]]s, challenged [[demon]]s, and even outwitted the [[Traveler]] himself. In one tale, Calazar is said to have dived into the mouth of a fire-breathing dragon only to find himself in the [[plane]] of [[Fernia]].
