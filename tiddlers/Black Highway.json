        "text": "The Black Highway is a smuggling network that spans the continent of [[Khorvaire]]. It was founded in either [[Sigilstar]] or [[Southport|Pylas Maradal]] early in the [[Last War]], and quickly spread to major metropolitan areas throughout the [[Five Nations]] and beyond. The organization thrived during the war, providing black market access to otherwise inaccessible goods and items; if you wanted [[Aundair]]ian wine in [[Sharn]] during an embargo, you needed a contact in the Black Highway. In the wake of the [[Mourning]] and the end of the war, the network has been shrinking and splintering as the profitability of illicit goods declines and the [[Sentinel Marshals]] crack down on international crime.\n\nToday, the Black Highway is led by the [[elf]] woman Sillet Phelar, though she often delegates operations to local crime syndicates (such as the [[Boromar Clan]] in [[Sharn]] and the [[White Hand Guild]] in [[Sigilstar]]). Beyond Sharn and Sigilstar, its primary areas of influence are [[Thaliost]], [[Passage]], [[Vedykar]], [[Stormhome]], and [[Port Krez]], as well as the floating haven known as [[Sea Weed]]. It no longer has any presence in what was once Southport (now [[Pylas Maradal]], [[Valenar]]) since the [[Tairnadal]] seized Eastern [[Cyre]] in 956 YK.",
