This cold steel spear is topped with a menacing spike of enchanted [[Risian ice]]. The spear does a great deal of extra cold damage to any target it hits, and cuts through any resistance to cold.

When you incapacitate a creature no larger than a [[troll]] with an attack from this weapon, you can choose to encase that creature in [[Risian ice]]. An encased creature experiences the "Preservation" property of [[Risia]], entering a state of suspended animation until the ice is destroyed and the creature is released.

When you plunge this pike into the ground at your feet, the blade of the pike magically vanishes into the earth and summons up to three icy spikes from the ground nearby. The spikes erupt from the ground at different locations you can see within 20 feet of you, stabbing at up to three targets of your choice. The spikes then immediately recede into the ground, and the icy blade of the pike reappears.
