While some have called Professor Caldyn’s work on the [[Draconic Prophecy]] “the ravings of a lunatic,” Morgrave stands by Caldyn’s scholarship and believes that history will vindicate his remarkable work. When speaking to the professor, please avoid making\nany sudden movements or loud noises.\n\nSee also [[Caldyn Fragments]].",
