Shaen is cool and calculating; she has no interest in holding the position of high prince, but she keeps a close eye on political struggles and has often served as a mediator. The previous leader was [[Prince Moren|Ship of Bones]]; according to legend, Moren was cursed for his dark practices and now sails the [[Bitter Sea]] in a ship of bones.",
