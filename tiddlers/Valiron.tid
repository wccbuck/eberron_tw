Valiron is a village in [[Thrane]], on the shores of [[Lake Brey]]. It lies near Valin Field, the site of many bloody battles throughout the [[Last War]]. The most prominent was known as the Battle of Kemman Estate in 910 YK, during which hundreds of [[Brelish|Breland]] soldiers were scorched by waves of [[Silver Flame]] commanded by fanatical [[templar]]s and [[cleric]]s.

Valiron was named after [[Keeper of the Flame]] Valiron Silverthorn (525â€“578 [[YK|Modern Age]]).
