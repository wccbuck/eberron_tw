Believed to be almost as old as the\n[[Emperor]], the lighthouse’s gleaming crystal slowly turns,\ncasting its light out to sea and then across the city.\n\nStrangely, the lighthouse building does not contain\nany rooms or stairs, being made of solid stone, except\nfor the ground floor and cellars. These chambers have\nbeen claimed by [[Eldamir Fallowcrest]], who maintains\nthem as his private haven and library. He is paranoid in\nhis defense of his books, and though he allows visitors\nto examine them one at a time, he hovers over their\nshoulder. At the first sign of trouble, he locks down the\nlibrary and activates traps to secure his collection.",
