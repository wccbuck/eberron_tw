Among the best duelists of House [[Orien]] are the swiftblades (also known as "blades of Orien"), peerless swordmasters whose [[Marks of Passage|Mark of Passage]] enable them to cut paths between worlds with their flashing blades. A swiftblade can slice a rift in the fabric of the world, dart through it, and then appear on the other side of the battlefield.
When they practice against their peers, the fights range across neighborhoods and cities as the sparring partners teleport from place to place.

House [[Orien]] calls upon swiftblades to defend the house's interests with weapon and word. The house dispatches the duelists to conduct negotiations or investigate disturbances in its travel network. With their sophisticated demeanor, swiftblades are often underestimated by House Orien's enemies. Many would-be bandits and hijackers who have tried to ply their trades on the [[lightning rail]] have found themselves teleported straight from the passenger cart to the cargo cart—and the sentries guarding it.
