An //orb of shielding// is a polished, spherical chunk of crystal or stone aligned to one of the [[plane]]s of existence. Often the stone will have been quarried from within a [[manifest zone]]. Spellcasters can use this orb as a spellcasting focus. While holding the orb, one can withstand the destructive effects associated with that plane. [[Fernia]]n basalt makes one more resistant to fire; [[Mabar]]an obsidian allows one to withstand necrotic energy; [[Xorian|Xoriat]] marble makes one more psychically resilient; and so on.
