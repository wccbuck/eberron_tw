        "text": "The Knights Arcane of [[Aundair]] is a large order of [[eldritch knight]]s that embodies the mixing of [[arcane|arcane magic]] and martial traditions. Many of the Knights Arcane conventionally raise their own mounts to serve as traditional cavalry, mixing spell and blade from horseback. The Knights Phantom are an elite unit of light cavalry that prefer to leverage the spell [[phantom steed]] over flesh and blood mounts, using a special [[magic item]] that extends the duration of the steed for several hours.\n\nPerhaps the most famous of the Knights Arcane are the [[dragonhawk]] riders, whose mastery of magic solidified [[Aundair]]'s aerial superiority during the [[Last War]]. Still, this wasn't enough to prevent the major losses Aundair faced throughout the war. It takes years for a [[dragonhawk]] to grow to a rideable size and war-ready state. Furthermore, the reliance on the noble class for both mounts and riders limited the overall size and scope of aerial warfare.\n\nThe Knights Arcane are led by Lord [[Darro ir'Lain]].",
