Hal'laman is the [[Eternal Dominion]] city built on and around the [[kar'lassa]] tied to the [[plane]] of [[Lamannia]]. The flora and fauna of this region
are unnaturally fertile. Hal’laman is a center for all forms of
animal husbandry, and also holds the largest [[sahuagin]] spawning pools of
the Dominion. When [[Lamannia]] is coterminous, growth rates
spike dramatically; it’s always a struggle to keep the city safe
during these times, with aggressive beasts swept into frenzies
and vegetation becoming [[shambling mound]]s.
