This small shield is the repurposed pot lid of a famous adventuring chef. While wielding the shield, you have [[advantage]] to defend against fire. In addition, if you place the shield face-down over a pot or similar vessel that is holding no more than 2 gallons of a water-based liquid inside, the liquid inside the vessel comes to a rolling boil after 10 minutes.
