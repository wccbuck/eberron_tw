A hulking [[humanoid]] with glistening pink flesh and arms that droop to its knees, a dolgarr resembles an ape with its skin turned inside out. Watery mucus drains from a dolgarrâ€™s recessed naval cavity into the corners of its mouth, which gapes open to reveal ridges of teeth that look like jagged fingernails. These creatures were once [[bugbear]]s, but were twisted by [[Dyrrn]] the Corruptor, and now understand nothing but mindless savagery.
