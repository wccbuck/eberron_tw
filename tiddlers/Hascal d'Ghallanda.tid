The [[Drunken Dragon]] in [[Clifftop]], [[Sharn]], is owned by Hascal d'[[Ghallanda]],
a cheerful middle-aged [[halfling]]. Hascal began his
life as an explorer, but gave up the trade after losing
his lower left leg and his right eye in a particularly
disastrous trip to [[Xen'drik]], and returned to pick
up the family business. He has an assortment of
beautifully carved artificial limbs and colorful eye
patches that correspond to his flamboyant outfits.
Hascal is an extremely knowledgeable and talented
fellow who, given an opportunity, can spend hours
talking about his adventures.

Hascal possesses the [[Mark of Hospitality]]. Though he no longer
actively adventures, Hascal remains a member of the [[Clifftop Adventurers' Guild]].
