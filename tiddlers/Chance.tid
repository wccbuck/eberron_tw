[[Dragoneyes]] has quite a few rowdy gambling halls, but Chance is a more sophisticated casino. In addition to running the standard games and making odds on the various races and sporting events that occur throughout the city, Chance has a reputation for being able to arrange and cover almost any bet. Can you survive for two days with House [[Tarkanan]]
trying to assassinate you? Can you seduce the ambassador from [[Aerenal]] in the next 24 hours? Chance makes the odds, takes the bet, and makes the arrangements required to set the challenge in motion. 

The casino is owned by a [[changeling]] named Chance, who is also a priest of the [[Traveler]]. Almost nothing is known about Chance; the changeling wears a different guise
every night, and the only way to recognize Chance is by the distinctive amulet they wear.

Chance is not an agent of the [[Tyrants]]. They respect the guild and may provide magical assistance to guild members, but they serve the [[Traveler]] in their own way and stand above the guilds and politics of the city.
