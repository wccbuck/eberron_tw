This gleaming suit of plate armor has a mirror-like sheen that reflects even tiny sparks of light into brilliant ribbons of blazing color, and it glows as brightly as a torch. Once per day, while running in a straight line, the wearer of this armor can activate its special ability and transform their body into pure light. The wearer becomes incorporeal during this time, and can pass through any creatures and obstacles that wouldn't hinder other incorporeal creatures like [[spirit]]s. The effect lasts for up to 5 seconds, or until you change directions or reduce your speed below a sprinting pace (about 8 mph).
