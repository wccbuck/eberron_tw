Fire [[giant]]s are broader and stronger than some of their taller kin, resembling huge [[dwarves|dwarf]] with fiery orange hair and beards and soot- or ash-colored skin. Their average height is around 18 ft, and their average lifespan is around 350 years.

Fire giants are known among the giants as the most talented crafters of metal and [[magic item]]s, and are thought to be descendants of the mighty [[Sulat League]]. 

The most notable fire giant in [[Khorvaire]] is the [[Gorodan Ashlord]], [[warlord]] of [[Vralkek]] and the surrounding area in [[Droaam]].
