        "text": "The Khavish Theater, one of\nfour upscale theaters in [[Upper Menthis]] (the other\nthree are all located in the [[University District]]), stands\nout for its ability to cater to the needs of [[gnome]]s and [[gnome]]-sized races, with ample seating for people of all sizes. Two stage troupes share the theater—the Khavish Players, made up mostly of [[human]] actors, and the [[Zilargo]] Repertoire Group,\nconsisting entirely of gnome performers.\n\nThe Khavish Players present more contemporary and widely appealing acts than the performers\nat the other Upper Menthis theaters, incorporating\nmusic, sex, and comedy—though not to the extent of\nthe burlesque found in [[Lower Menthis]]. The Zilargo\nRepertoire Group generally performs works that\nonly interest [[gnome]]s, full of intricate histories and\na level of detail that audiences of other races find\nexcessive (and mostly boring). Occasionally, they\nstage a comedy aimed at mixed-race audiences, generally featuring acrobatics and pratfalls. Recently,\nthe famous gnome [[bard]] [[Kessler]] agreed to play with\nthe Zilargo Repertoire Group, and that has brought\nmore mixed crowds to their performances.",
