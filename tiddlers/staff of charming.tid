If a spellcaster is attuned to this staff, they can cast [[charm]], [[command]], or [[comprehend languages]] using their own power. 

In addition, the wielder gains [[advantage]] to resist [[enchantment]] spells cast on them. On a [[critical|full success]], the spell is reflected back onto the caster as if the staff wielder had cast the spell.
