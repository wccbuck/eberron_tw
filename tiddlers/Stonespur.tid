Stonespur is an island in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. 

There are rumors that Baron [[Elar d'Thuranni]] has
been constructing secret [[enclave]]s for activities that
the [[Shadow Network|Thuranni]] wants to hide even from trusted
clients. Sailors claim to have seen a black citadel near
the island of Stonespur, protected with powerful
magic; this could be one of Elarâ€™s secret fortresses.
