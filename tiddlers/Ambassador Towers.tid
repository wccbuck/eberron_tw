Ambassador Towers, [[Sharn]]'s embassy district, is
home to embassies and consulates from ten foreign nations: [[Aundair]], [[Cyre]], [[Karrnath]], the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], the [[Mror Holds]], the [[Talenta Plains]],
[[Thrane]], [[Zilargo]], [[Aerenal]], and [[Riedra]]. A
single consul or ambassador heads each embassy. Aside from the dignitaries, the rest of the embassy staff consists of bureaucrats and
clerks as well as diplomats, negotiators, and spies. In
the minds of [[Khorvaire]]'s diplomatic community, the
[[Last War]] might not be overâ€”a few years of peace could
be nothing more than a brief hiatus from a conflict
that lasted a century, and hostilities could erupt again
at any moment. Best to be prepared.

[[Cyre]]'s embassy was established here long before
the [[Last War]], and its staff continues to advocate
for the interests of the villagers of [[New Cyre]], in
eastern [[Breland]].
