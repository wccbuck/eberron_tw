title: Siberyan Theory
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Siberyan theory is the dominant [[arcane tradition|arcane theory]] of the [[Five Nations]]. It asserts that [[arcane magic]] taps energies that flow from the Ring of [[Siberys]]. This power—sometimes called the "blood of Siberys"—is the same fundamental force the [[Progenitor Dragons]] used to shape reality; arcane magic essentially reshapes reality to produce the desired result. Certainly, the blood of Siberys can be used to create a [[fireball]]; once upon a time, that same power was used to create //the [[Sun]]//.

Siberyan magic is in some ways the most scientific approach to magic, and can in a sense be seen as analogous to programming; the wizard is rewriting the code that defines reality. Its invocations are words of power that activate specific energies—fire, vast, distance—while its gestures shape and focus those energies. But ultimately, the forces flow through the spellcaster and it is a mental exertion—both intense calculations and an exertion of will—that generates the change. A [[wizard]] can look at a [[spellbook]] and understand the theory behind a higher level [[spell]]. They can gather the right materials, make the appropriate gestures, say the right words. But if they don’t have enough experience and talent, or if they are mentally or physically exhausted, they can’t perform the mental work required to produce the result. 

Siberyan theory is the most widespread form of magic, used across the [[Five Nations]] and in [[Aerenal]]. However, it’s a broad field of magic and there are different techniques within it. The [[wizard]]s of [[Aerenal]] and those of [[Arcanix]] both use verbal components that invoke the same, fundamental words of power. However, the [[Aereni]] techniques are highly formalized and precise—it’s a highly effective technique, but it takes decades to master. Since most [[human]]s don’t have decades, Arcanix helps students develop idiosyncratic techniques—to figure out what resonates with them. This works, but the Aereni find it disturbingly sloppy and haphazard.

!! The Source of Arcane Magic

The commonly accepted theory is that arcane energy—”the blood of [[Siberys]]”—was part of the [[Progenitors|Progenitor Dragons]]. According to the primal myths, the Ring of Siberys //is// Siberys; this energy is simply the residual primordial power of a cosmic entity. This is supported by the fact that Siberys [[dragonshard]]s are highly effective at focusing arcane energies. Many [[magical implement]]s use Siberys shards in some way. However, there is an academic faction that asserts that there is no reason to believe that the Progenitors were cosmic [[dragon]]s or even [[immortal]]. These sages believe that the Ring of Siberys might have predated the Progenitors, and that they could have been a trio of mortal [[wizard]]s of exceptional skill—wizards who used the same basic principles a modern wizard uses to create a [[fireball]] to shape a sun. Those who follow this path generally assert that the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]] were either remarkable mortals or that they were simply [[immortal]] entities—like the [[celestial]]s and [[fiend]]s—created by the mortal Progenitors as part of their vast work. These scholars believe that this shows the limitless potential of [[arcane magic]]—that wizards who unlock its greatest secrets could create new worlds or even shape planes of existence.

Siberyan verbal components are grounded in the [[Draconic]] [[language]], though there is more to a verbal component than simply speaking in Draconic; ultimately it is about the invocation of //words of power// that aren’t used in everyday speech. A [[wizard]] doesn’t have to //understand// [[Draconic]] to perform magic, but it helps provided deeper insight into the workings of a particular [[spell]].
