The name refers not to\nthe towers that rise toward the sky, but to the maze of\ncaverns stretching out below the enclave and under\nthe [[Seawall Mountains]]. Once home to the ancestors of the clan, these caverns are festooned with carvingsâ€”historical records dating back to the [[Age of Dhakaan|Age of Monsters]], etched carefully into the stone walls. Today, these tunnels also serve as the vaults of the house, holding records of vital communications and\nother secret lore.\n\nThe Labyrinth is also the headquarters of the [[Ninth College]] [[arcane order]].",
