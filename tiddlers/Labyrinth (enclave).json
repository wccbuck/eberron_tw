The name refers not to\nthe towers that rise toward the sky, but to the maze of\ncaverns stretching out below the enclave and under\nthe [[Seawall Mountains]]. Once home to the ancestors of the clan, these caverns are festooned with carvingsâ€”historical records dating back to the [[Age of Dhakaan|Age of Monsters]], etched carefully into the stone walls. Today, these tunnels also serve as the vaults of the house, holding records of vital communications and\nother secret lore.",
