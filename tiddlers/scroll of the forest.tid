title: scroll of the forest
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This sheaf of fibrous paper is rolled into a scroll and fastened with a bit of twine. When the scroll is thrown on the ground and the incantation is uttered, a giant sycamore tree immediately springs from the earth. The tree is permanent and this scroll can only be used once.
