This wand is made from magic wax and iron, with a design that resembles a candle and candlestick. The wand produces a harmless magical flame that is indistinguishable from normal candlelight, although the wax never melts or changes shape. While holding the wand, you can extinguish or relight the flame at will.

If you are a spellcaster [[attuned|attunement]] to this wand, you can cast [[message]] and [[sending]] while holding it. In addition, whenever you cast a spell of a [[spell tier]] of rare or lower using this wand, you can cast it much more quietly than normal.
