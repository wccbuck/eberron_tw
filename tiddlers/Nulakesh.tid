''Population:'' <<ntls>>

The Nulakesh Empire dominated central [[Sarlona]] for centuries before the [[Sundering]]. Nulakesh lacked the magical or philosophical sophistication of many of the smaller kingdoms, but it had a large, dedicated population and extensive natural resources, along with a superbly disciplined army. Nulakesh went through many periods of expansion
and decline over the centuries, and it was fading when the [[quori]] came to [[Sarlona]]. Dream manipulation helped inspire the Nulakesh war leaders to reclaim their ancestral glory and, later, to convert the disgruntled populace
to the [[Path of Inspiration]]. The strong martial tradition
continues to the present day, and much of the [[Harmonious Shield]] is recruited from this province.

The [[Edgewalkers]] are based in the massive fortress-city of [[Dar Mun]], which is poised between four [[wild zone]]s (including old [[Nulakar]], the [[Imperial Crypt]], and two [[Shavaran|Shavarath]] zones). In addition to being the primary garrison and training facility for the Edgewalkers, it holds the finest arcane library and workshops in [[Riedra]]. 

The Nulakeshi despise nonhumans; as a result,
[[shifter]]s and [[ogre]]s are rarely deployed in this province.
The Nulakeshi are deeply devoted to the [[Inspired]], and
the daily exercises of the peasants often have a martial
theme. Many people who would be commoners in other
provinces are trained as warriors.

!! The Old Kingdom

Long before anyone had dreamed of the [[Unity]] of [[Riedra]], the Empire of Nulakesh was the most powerful force in [[Sarlona]]. Beginning as a single city-state, its legions conquered and assimilated the people of the surrounding region, incorporating them into its war machine. At its height, the Empire of Nulakesh dominated much of what is now [[Pyrine]] and [[Dor Maleer]]. The empire waxed and waned many times; its current borders reflect the lands it held when the [[Inspired]] rebellion finally wiped out the Imperial line at the end of the [[Sundering]]. 

Nulakesh is strongly influenced by [[Daanvi]] and [[Shavarath]]. Where [[Irian]] and the [[Silver Flame]] channeled the [[Khalesh]]ites to fight for the light, the Nulakeshi were driven by war and order. This drove deep martial instincts and an innate aptitude for martial discipline... a legacy that still lingers in [[Karrnath]] today. But the Nulakeshi genius for war was all too often wielded by tyrants, as the influence of the [[Iron Ward]] shaped the Imperial line. 

Nulakesh has a high number of [[manifest zone]]s tied to [[Shavarath]]. These were the foundations of most of the ancient city-states, and still are today; Nulakesh provides the bulk of the soldiers of the [[Harmonious Shield]], and even Nulakeshi peasants engage in regular martial drills. However, it also has [[wild zone]]s, and these have been a danger throughout the history of the region. One of the Shavaran wild zones is connected to the layer known as the [[Warring Cities]]. Other zones don't serve as actual portals to [[Shavarath]], but they recreate its deadly environs. All too often these Shavaran wild zones have been the source of bloodshed or tragedy, with razor storms or sword wraiths flowing beyond the borders of the zone to threaten the lands beyond. 

[[Daanvi]]an zones are less dramatic, but they are largely tied to the oppressive layers of the Perfect Order. The ancient capital of the Empire, the city of [[Nulakar]], was built in a zone tied to the [[Iron Ward]] of Daanvi. While there was no direct portal between the planes, accounts suggest that more than one [[devil]] passed from Daanvi into Nulakar, and that there was a time when the Nulakeshi emperors had fiendish advisors. 

!!! The Fall of Nulakesh

Nulakesh was at a low point when the [[Sundering]] began. The [[Dreaming Dark]] began by firing up their imperial spirit, giving the emperor and warlords dreams of regaining their past glories. The Sundering lasted for generations, and the resurgent Nulakesh was just the beginning of their plans. It became a tool they used to cripple surrounding nations—the force that fiercely battled the foul [[serpent-people|shulassakar]] of [[Khalesh]] and brought righteous fury to [[Ohr Kaluun]]. Along the way, the [[quori]] encouraged the emperors to indulge in ever-greater acts of cruel tyranny, and to work with their [[Daanvi]]an [[devil]]s (who were acting independently, with no idea of the role they were playing in the greater schemes). Even the stoic Nulakeshi had a breaking point; as they grew close to it, the first [[Inspired]] rose up, promising to overthrow the tyrants—whom they revealed to be working with devils!—and to lead the people on the true path of righteousness, cleansing ALL the foulness from [[Sarlona]]. Once the Inspired of Nulakesh convinced their forces to unite with the Inspired-led armies of [[Corvagura]], the fate of the continent was sealed.
