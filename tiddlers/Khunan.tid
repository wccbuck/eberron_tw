tooltip: province of Syrkarn, once a great kingdom, origin of yuan-ti
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The ancient kingdom of Khunan was once the greatest of the four kingdoms of what is now the region of [[Syrkarn]] in [[Sarlona]]. The [[wizard]]s of this land were experts in the [[Externalist|Externalist Theory]] tradition of [[arcane magic]], directly channeling the power of the [[plane]]s to produce incredible displays of mystical might.

In the early days of the [[Sundering]], Khunan invaded its neighbor [[Lamecha]], ostensibly for the southern ports that stayed largely free of [[Rhiavhaar]] piracy. [[Mae-Kree]], [[Sunyagir]], and [[Lamecha]] allied against Khunan. As a result, a devastating period of arcane conflict known as the magewars ensued.

When it was done, great Khunan lay broken. Some say the kingdom was destroyed by the partial release and re-binding of a demonic [[overlord]] from the [[Age of Demons]], but precise records of what happened to Khunan have been lost or destroyed. Over the course of decades, tribes of [[ogre]]s crossed the [[Andnemun Desert]], eager to occupy the ruins of this once-great land. In their midst, however, new creatures arose that had
never before been seen on [[Sarlona]]n soilâ€”the [[yuan-ti]]. More cunning than the [[ogre]]s and even [[oni]], they quickly established dominance over the remnants of Khunan.

Fragments of lost lore collected by [[Adar]]'s [[Keepers of the Word]] suggest that sages of the day believed the [[yuan-ti]] to be magical mutants, descendants of the Khunani
transformed into serpent-like aberrations that quickly rechristened their new kingdom "Syrkarn."

!! The Syrkarn Exodus

When the [[Inspired]] arrived on Sarlona, the whispered alliances they forged among the warring human nations were quickly turned against the yuan-ti. [[Syrkarn]] was invaded, and the yuan-ti were hunted to the point of extinction. However, even in the aftermath of victory, the human populations of [[Lamecha]], [[Sunyagir]], and [[Mae-Kree]] were suddenly ordered out of their ancestral lands. In 90 Unity (-212 YK), thousands of people were moved and resettled in [[Caleshaz]], [[Dor Maleer]], and [[Ghirvagura]].

To this day, no official rationale for the exodus has
been given. However, those who have attempted to piece
together and connect the oral histories of the yuan-ti
with the vague lore of the [[Age of Demons]] have suggested
that in the course of eliminating the threat of the intelligent and powerfully psionic yuan-ti, the Inspired discovered the dark power behind their creation.

!! Khunan Today

The savannahs of the modern province of Khunan are populated by [[human]]s and [[eneko]]. The largest city in [[Syrkarn]], [[Nderitese]], is built on the foundations of ancient [[yuan-ti]] ruins in Khunan, just north of the [[Tese Hills]]. The splendor of the Itzaina plains are one of the most beautiful sights in [[Sarlona]], filled with vibrant wildflowers and plants seen nowhere else on Eberron.

The kingdom once included the [[Aventus Islands]], but today they are considered part of the [[Riedra]]n province of [[Rhiavhaar]]. However, the [[Hailana Islands]] are still part of the province of Khunan.

Pieces of the old [[Khunanese]] [[language]] live on in many modern languages, including the [[Common]] tongue of [[Khorvaire]]. Others include [[Syrk]], [[Adaran]], [[Lhazaaran]], and [[Argon]].
