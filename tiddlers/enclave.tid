In a small community, a [[dragonmarked house]] might be
represented by a single business. A village might have a
[[Jorasco]] healing house, a tiny [[Sivis]] [[message station|speaking stone]], or a
[[Gold Dragon Inn]] of House [[Ghallanda]], all run by individuals. Large cities and metropolises have dozens of such
house businesses, but they also have ''enclaves''—the citadels
of the dragonmarked houses.

A house enclave is a self-contained community where
a member of a house can spend months without ever
needing to leave. The center of the enclave includes production, training, and administration facilities, living
quarters, and shops catering to the everyday needs of its inhabitants. This region of an enclave is reserved for the
private business of the house, and strangers are allowed
in only under special circumstances. 

The secondary ring of the enclave is where business
occurs, and is the site of [[guild|trade guild]] offices, shops, and other
facilities. Customers, [[dragonmark]]ed heirs, and guild
members with no family connections all cross paths here.
Though the everyday services of house and guild can be
found across [[Khorvaire]], a house’s most expensive services
are exclusive to its enclaves. Courier stations are common
throughout [[Sharn]], for example, but teleportation is
available only at the [[Orien]] enclave in [[Dragon Towers]].
Part shopping center, part production facility, and part
suburb, a house enclave is often the economic center of
the community in which it is found.
