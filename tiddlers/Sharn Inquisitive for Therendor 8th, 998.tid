!! ‘Silent Plague’ Quarantine Lifted for Smoky Towers

[[SHARN|Sharn]]—The [[Sharn Watch]] lifted the quarantine for the [[Smoky Towers]] district at dawn today, saying the baffling “Silent Plague” is not contagious.

The Watch’s [[Blackened Book]] investigators still seek the source of the mysterious affliction, which leaves its victims pale and unable to speak.

“Our magical investigations have confirmed that the name ‘Silent Plague’ is actually a misnomer. It’s a curse, not a disease,” said Kareyn Allandidor, senior [[inquisitive]] for the [[Blackened Book]].

So far, 142 residents of the district suffer from the Silent Plague. Among the victims are Mardan Kluhir, Jordren d’Phiarlan, “Needles” Norrick, Gransha Fleetfinger, and several other noted singers.

But the Silent Plague isn’t limited to the entertainers. Unndro Bhalask, special assistant to [[Councillor|Sharn Council]] [[Caskar Halavik]], has the affliction.

Most of the Silent Plague’s victims remain in seclusion. The [[Sharn Inquisitive]] will continue its efforts to find and interview (in writing) one or more of the plague victims.

The lifting of the quarantine means that the Children’s Charity Parade scheduled for Zul can keep to its traditional route through the district. Parade organizer Thanim Lariendas said a high turnout is expected despite lingering fears about the Silent Plague.

“I appreciate the Watch being careful with our health—no one wants the plague,” he said. “The Watch says that [[Smoky Towers]] is perfectly safe, and the children have been looking forward to this parade all year.”

!! Morgrave Sage Says Karrn the Conqueror Employed Necromancy

[[SHARN|Sharn]]—In the final days of his regime, [[Karrn the Conqueror]] employed [[necromantic|necromancy]] magic to trap the souls of suspected conspirators against his rule, according to controversial research from Adele Corsinian, a [[Morgrave University]] historian specializing in Karrn’s era.

A critical reevaluation of period documents suggests that the conspirators executed in the “purge of Shekesaal” in the last year of Karrn’s reign remained animate after their execution. The bodies were beheaded before their bodies were burned, and Corsinian contends that the heads were kept alive with [[necromancy]] so that Karrn could maintain contact of sorts with the conspirators.

“It’s important to consider [[Karrn|Karrn the Conqueror]]’s mindset at the time,” Corsinian said at a symposium on Wir. “He could see his empire fraying at the edges already, and he’d seen proof that some of his closest advisors—his most trusted inner circle—were conspiring against him. He did what he had to do, but then he secretly kept them alive.”

The exact nature of the necromantic magic is lost to time, Corsinian said, but would likely have ensured the conspirators’ loyalty as well as restoring a semblance of life.

Conventional histories of the era record the executions of twelve conspirators. “But the executions were beheadings, and they weren’t public. That makes the purge of Shekesaal unprecedented in at least two aspects. Why didn’t General Shekesaal and his alleged co-conspirators get the gory public executions that every other traitor received?” said Corsinian.

Corsinian further notes that among Karrn’s funerary gifts, twelve lacquered boxes are listed. “Amid all these artistic treasures and powerful receptacles of magic, why list twelve boxes? I contend it’s because they held the necromantic remains of Shekesaal and the other conspirators, and that Karrn intended to be buried with them.”

Few of Karrn’s funerary gifts were actually buried with him because relatives descended on his palace shortly after the Conqueror’s death, stripping it nearly bare, Corsinian said. The lacquered boxes were undoubtedly taken by one or more of those relatives, then lost in the chaos following the fall of Karrn’s empire, he said.

Corsinian’s declarations at the symposium did not go uncontested. Ghaul ir’Jurchek, master historian at [[Korth]]’s Shrine of the Conqueror, said the necromantic survival of the Shekesaal conspirators was “a fairy tale that isn’t true just because it isn’t directly contradicted by anything in the historical record.”

While [[Karrn the Conqueror]] employed talented magicians of all sorts and had no particular dislike for [[necromancy]], that doesn’t mean he kept the heads of condemned criminals alive after death, ir’Jurchek said.

A more interesting historical question, ir’Jurchek said, is whether all twelve of the conspirators were guilty of treason. Many believe that General Shekesaal’s interest in continuity of rule was tragically misinterpreted by court gossips, ir’Jurchek said. Two of the executed warlords, Kau and Hujiri, were far from the capital at the time and evinced no interest in court politics. And trial records shed little light on what role Yahina the concubine and Vlohr the [[alchemist]] played in the conspiracy, if any.

“Historians like myself and Corsinian have been going back and forth over the purge of Shekesaal for centuries, and we’ll still be arguing in centuries to come,” ir’Jurchek said. “As much as I’d like to ask Shekesaal’s animated head whether he was really guilty or not, real-world history doesn’t work that way.”

!! Breland Apologizes for Arrest of Orien Scion

[[VATHIROND|Vathirond]]—General Jorekk Blandra, commander of the [[King's Shields]] 4th Border Army, apologized on Sar for the day-long detention of a high-ranking member of House [[Orien]] traveling to [[Sharn]] on House business.

“In our zeal to protect the borders of this fair nation from interlopers and criminals, we misinterpreted some sensitive intelligence,” he said in a written statement issued from the army’s keep northwest of the city. “Our sincerest apologies go out to Jarla d’Orien and members of her entourage for the delay.”

Jarla d’Orien oversees the house’s caravan operations throughout western [[Khorvaire]]. Her detention in [[Vathirond]] last week brought a swift response from House [[Orien]], which briefly suspended [[lightning rail]] service to [[Breland]] destinations in response to the arrest. She was freed last Zor.

General Blandra’s statement did not mention the specific charges that resulted in d’Orien’s arrest, nor the nature of the intelligence that his staff misinterpreted. Staff officers of the King’s Shields 4th said the general was traveling back to [[Wroat]] and unavailable for further comment.

!! House Tharashk Announces Lhazaar Investment Pacts

[[ZARASH’AK|Zarash'ak]]—House [[Tharashk]] announced on Zol an ambitious set of [[dragonshard]] prospecting ventures in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], the northeastern confederacy of sea barons and merchant princes.

“[[Tharashk]]'s knack for [[dragonshard]] extraction is known across [[Khorvaire]],” said [[triumvir|Tharashk triumvirate]] [[Khandar'Aashta]] from the House compound in the [[Shadow Marches]]. “And we have every confidence that, in conjunction with our local partners in [[Regalport]] and beyond, our efforts in the [[Principalities|Lhazaar Principalities]] will be just as profitable.”

Members of the [[Finders Guild]] from the House [[Tharashk]]’s [[Aashta]] family will direct the new ventures, Khandar’Aashta said. House prospectors are already working with Prince [[Ryger ir'Wynarn]]’s [[Seadragons]] for transport to several remote islands in the Lhazaar archipelago. Other sea barons are being offered similar transport deals in exchange for a percentage of profits from [[dragonshard]] prospecting.

House [[Tharashk]]’s announcement caught many house watchers by surprise, because the [[Lhazaar Principalities]] have never been considered a lucrative source for [[dragonshard]]s. But some Lhazaar princes said they’d seen evidence of dragonshard wealth with their own eyes.

“The [[Tharashk]] prospector came back with a chest full of [[dragonshard]]s the size of my fingers—after only two weeks searching an island in my realm,” said Prince Kaelisk, commander of a Lhazaar [[fleet]] anchored at [[Stonespur]] Island. “The terms could be better, of course, but anyone in the merchant business says that. Suffice it to say that our agreement should be lucrative for both House [[Tharashk]] and for all under the protection of my [[Coldtide Fleet]],” he said.
