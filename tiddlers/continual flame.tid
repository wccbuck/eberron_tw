Casting this spell consumes [[5c|money]] of material components. A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched, and lasts until it is dispelled.
