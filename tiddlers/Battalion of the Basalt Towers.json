        "text": "This organization of [[fire giant]]s seeks to dominate [[Xen'drik]] by forging alliances with [[fiend]]s. Although this movement is less than a thousand years old, the fire giants trace their ancestry back to [[Adaxus]], the infamous Hellfire Titan of the [[Sulat League]] known for his demonic alliances. The [[wizard]]s of the Battalion lack Adaxus’s legendary power to bind and command fiends, but they frequently strike bargains with evil spirits to gain greater power. Members of the Battalion of the Basalt Towers consider it a great honor to be possessed by a fiend. \n\nThe base of the Battalion is the ancient [[Sulat|Sulat League]] citadel of [[Ram'kanek]], located in the [[Fangs of Argarak]] in central [[Xen'drik]]. Their leader is the powerful [[fire giant]] [[warlock]] known as ''Kyravia, the Cinderheart''.\n\n!! The Fire Storm\n\nIn [[946 YK|History of Stormreach]], the city of [[Stormreach]] came under attack by the Battalion of the Basalt Towers. In addition to physical force, the giants employed an artifact that called down meteor swarms upon the city; some of the craters from this conflict\ncan still be seen today. In a curious turn of events, the\n[[giants of Rushemé|Guardians of Rushemé]] and the [[Silaes Tairn]] joined with the [[Stormreach Guard]] and the [[dragonmarked house]]s to turn back this assault, not out of a desire to protect the city’s inhabitants but to keep the city out of the battalion’s hands. The power\nof the Basalt Towers was broken, but some of the giants\nsurvived and recent reports from the interior suggest\nthat they have rebuilt their forces.",
