        "text": "This organization of [[fire giant]]s seeks to dominate [[Xen'drik]] by forging\nalliances with [[fiend]]s. Although this movement is less than a thousand years old, the\nfire giants trace their ancestry back to Adaxus, an infamous prince of the [[Sulat League]] known for his demonic alliances. The [[wizard]]s of the Battalion lack Adaxus’s legendary power to bind and command fiends, but they frequently strike bargains with evil\nspirits to gain greater power. Members of the Battalion of the Basalt Towers consider\nit a great honor to be possessed by a fiend. \n\n!! The Fire Storm\n\nIn [[946 YK|History of Stormreach]], the city of [[Stormreach]] came under\nattack by the Battalion of the Basalt Towers. In addition to physical force, the giants\nemployed an artifact that called down meteor swarms\nupon the city; some of the craters from this conflict\ncan still be seen today. In a curious turn of events, the\n[[giants of Rushemé|Guardians of Rushemé]] joined with the [[Stormreach Guard]]\nand the [[dragonmarked house]]s to turn back this assault,\nnot out of a desire to protect the city’s inhabitants but\nto keep the city out of the battalion’s hands. The power\nof the Basalt Towers was broken, but some of the giants\nsurvived and recent reports from the interior suggest\nthat they have rebuilt their forces.",
