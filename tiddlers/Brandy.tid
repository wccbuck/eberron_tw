The [[Detention]] tavern in [[Sharn]]'s [[University District]] is run by a [[halfling]] who calls herself Brandy. She claims to be a excoriate, driven from House [[Ghallanda]] after refusing to water down her ale, but some say she’s the [[Ghallanda patriarch|Yoren d'Ghallanda]]’s heir. Whatever the truth, Detention doesn't display a [[Hostelers Guild]] license anywhere visible.
