This clan specializes in terror tactics\nand guerrilla warfare. Whenever possible, the Reavers prefer\nto stalk isolated prey using methods designed to frighten\nthem prior to making a kill. They draw this fear out for\nas long as possible, reveling in the terror of their victims.\nClan members make masks and other decorations using\nthe bones and skin of their victims. They file their teeth\nand let their nails grow long in emulation of the fiends\nthey admire.\n\nThe Moon Reavers are led by the cruel [[Karka Darkbane]].",
