Although some heirs specialize in one path or the other, every Thuranni is to some degree involved in espionage. As with House Phiarlan, House Thuranni’s covert services are made\navailable only to clients chosen by the house; one\ncan’t simply hire a Thuranni spy.\n\nHouse [[Thuranni]] excels both in the shaping arts\nand in the field of assassination. Members\nof House Thuranni are concerned\nwith the prosperity of their house,\nnot with abstract ideals of order or\nbalance.",
