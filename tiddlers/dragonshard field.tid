The [[Shadow Marches]] hold deposits of Eberron [[dragonshard]]s, the source of House [[Tharashk]]'s wealth. These
fields aren't as rich as those in [[Q'barra]], but there's gold
to be made by those willing to hunt for shards in the
dangerous swamps. 

The richest dragonshard fields in the Marches can be found on the western bank of the [[Glum River]], between [[Glumtown]] and [[Zarash'ak]] in shallow water. Such finds are marked by a pale red glow beneath the muck.
