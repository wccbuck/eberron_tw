It is an unfamiliar shape, not quite conforming\nto any kind of dragon seen on [[Eberron]]. More shocking,\nhowever, is its size. The head stretches three miles from\nsnout to horns. If it is the work of a sculptor, it would\nhave had to be carved from a mountain range. Many\npriests of [[Thir]] say it is the face of Eberron, and that when\nshe speaks it will be heard across the world. The [[children of Eberron|child of Eberron]] consider it a holy site, and young initiates come here to learn the mysteries of [[primal magic]] from older children.", "modified": "20210727192007710", "tags": "Argonnessen monument Thousand", "type": "text/vnd.tiddlywiki", "article": "the ", "category": "location", "color": "#3B5C0A", "points": "-43.754,118.13", "style": "{\"color\": \"#732873\"}"}
