title: Storybook Logic
tooltip: universal property: each layer of this plane has its own natural laws based on its internal logic
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

While on a [[plane]] with this property, each [[layer]] is driven by its story, and any rule can be overridden by a particular tale. Damage types could be swapped or rendered impotent; in the Valley of Stolen Fire of [[Thelanis]], all fire damage becomes cold damage. Certain specific actions could have [[advantage]] or [[disadvantage]]. In one layer, spells that restore health might have no effect; in another, a glass of wine could act as a [[potion of healing]]. But while these effects vary from layer to layer, they are entirely reliable within that layer and should feel logical based on the nature of the local story.
