        "text": "The Order of the Ethereal Blade was founded in the fifth century (YK) in [[Aundair]] as a duelist’s society, where members of other [[arcane order]]s could test their skills and spells in battle with fellow mages. What began as a mystical \"fight club\" became the core of the original [[Knights Arcane]]. Today, the Ethereal Blade focuses on the study and development of war magic, but it remains a dueling society whose members are always ready to prove their mettle in battle. Many of Aundair’s finest warmages are members of the Order, along with officers of the [[Knights Arcane]] and Knights Phantom.\n\nWhile it began as a [[wizard]]’s circle, today the Order of the Ethereal Blade welcomes [[eldritch knight]]s, [[arcane trickster]]s and others who blend martial and mystical techniques. There are other societies that cater purely to duelists and [[wandslinger]]s, including [[Fairhaven]]’s ''League of ir’Lain'' and the ''Darkwood Wands'' of [[Passage]].",
