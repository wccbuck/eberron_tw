        "text": "Kason ir'Wynarn, son of [[Wroann|Wroann ir'Wynarn]], became the second monarch of independent [[Breland]] in 919 YK. During the first two years of his short reign, King Kason was very cautious with committing troops to the front lines of the [[Last War]], and he attempted to minimize Breland's involvement in \"foreign entanglements.\" To that end, in 921 YK, Kason ordered his [[wizard]] advisors to investigate the possibility of summoning a regiment of [[demon]]s from [[Shavarath]] to fight on Breland's behalf. While some might say that a deal with demons is a \"foreign entanglement\" in the extreme, Kason believed he and his advisors could draft an infernal contract that protected them from significant consequences. \n\nDuring a particularly intense negotiation session with a [[marilith]] of the [[Century of Terror|Cruelty]] in mid-922 YK, the demon broke free of its bonds, consumed King Kason, and slayed three of his closest advisors before returning to [[Shavarath]]. Regent Brask led the nation until Kason's son Boranex came of age in 928. When details of the king's death became public knowledge five months after the event, [[Thrane]] immediately ended their armistice with [[Breland]] and began mobilizing their army against the \"diabolists\" to the south; they invaded Breland in 923 YK in what would later be called the Battle of the [[Greenhaunt]].",
