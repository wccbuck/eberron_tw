Zaeurl is an [[elven|elf]] [[werewolf|therianthrope]] and leader and founder of the [[Dark Pack]], the alliance of [[therianthrope]]s in [[Droaam]]. She was a survivor of the [[Silver Crusade]] over 160 years ago, in which she witnessed the massacre of her own family at the hands of templars of the [[Silver Flame]]. She spent more than a century seeking revenge, hunting down and killing templars and friars, before retreating to the [[Watching Wood]] in what is now [[Droaam]] and founding the [[Dark Pack]]. When the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]] came to power, they granted Zaeurl the status of [[warlord]]. Zaeurl is fiercely loyal to the Daughters.
