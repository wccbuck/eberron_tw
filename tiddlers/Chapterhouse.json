Run by Sorala dâ€™Ghallanda,\nit provides inexpensive accommodations at a variety of comfort levels and excellent\nentertainment. The hostel almost always has rooms\navailable, with one drawback: if you stay at the Chapterhouse, you can be certain someone knows exactly where you are.\n\nThe Chapterhouse is a wonderful place to find information. A PC might learn about a recent jungle expedition, a piece of gossip about a [[Storm Lord|Storm Lords]], a ship with a\nmysterious cargo, or some other bit of interesting news.",
