You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within 90 feet and lasts for up to 10 minutes. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides good cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult to move through. When creatures enter the wall's area, they are repeatedly and continuously sliced by the blades.
