You conjure a mass of thick, sticky, flammable webbing at a point of your choice within 60 feet. The webs fill a 20-foot diameter sphere from that point for up to 1 hour. The webbing must be anchored between two solid masses or layered across a solid surface or the conjured web will collapse on itself.
