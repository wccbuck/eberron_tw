Illumination waits for those who dare to step out of the light.//\n\n<div align=\"right\">—Taen d'Thuranni, bright phantasm of the [[Shadow Network]]</div>\n\nOnce part of House [[Phiarlan]], the [[elves|elf]] of House\nThuranni are now the rivals of their kin, competing in the fields of entertainment and espionage.\nThe Thuranni elves bear the [[Mark of Shadow]], and\nthey have the same skills and powers as their Phiarlan cousins. However, House Thuranni is smaller\nthan House Phiarlan and has fewer resources. This\ndiscrepancy gives Phiarlan an edge when it comes\nto entertainment and information-gathering. But\nThuranni is unmatched in one field: assassination.\nLike the [[displacer beast]] they use as their emblem, House\nThuranni elves are deadly and all but untouchable.\n\nBaron [[Elar d'Thuranni]] rules the house from an [[enclave]]\nin [[Regalport]], and he is always accompanied by a shadowy\npair, rumored to be embodiments of shadow itself. \n\n!! History of House {{!!title}}\n\nEven though the agents of House [[Phiarlan]]’s [[Serpentine Table]] are spies and espionage experts, the\nleaders of the house have always sought to be a force\nfor order and balance. On more than one occasion\nthey helped a rightful heir of [[Galifar]] defeat would-be\nusurpers, and if Queen [[Mishann|Mishann ir'Wynarn]] had called on the\nhouse for help, the [[Last War]] might have come to an\nabrupt end. House Phiarlan did good business during\nthe war: Every nation needed intelligence. However,\nthis work put the house under tremendous pressure. Shadowmarked elves from different families often found themselves working at cross-purposes,\nand some lost sight of their neutrality and developed\nattachments to a particular nation.\n\nThis situation came to a head in 972 YK, when\nThuranni assassins turned on another family within\nHouse [[Phiarlan]]—the [[Paelion]] line. The few Paelions\nwho survived this attempt at extermination went\ninto hiding. Baron [[Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan]] condemned the action and called for the excoriation of\nthe entire Thuranni family. [[Elar Thuranni|Elar d'Thuranni]] refused to\naccept this judgment, declaring his family to be a new\nhouse. After years of argument, the [[Twelve]] agreed,\nand House Thuranni was born.\n\nThis is the official story of the [[Shadow Schism]], but\nmany questions remain. What triggered the massacre of the [[Paelion]]s? [[Elar|Elar d'Thuranni]] claims to have uncovered a Paelion plot to assassinate kings and [[dragonmark]]ed barons. But there are those who say that both Elar and [[Elvinor|Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan]] wanted the split, and used the Paelions as scapegoats. If this is true, what could be the reason?\n\n!!! The Last War\n\nFor most of the [[Last War]], the\nThuranni were part of House [[Phiarlan]]. The Thuranni\nline was concentrated in northwestern [[Khorvaire]]\nand performed much of its work for [[Karrnath]]. It\nworked closely with the Order of the [[Emerald Claw]],\nand some say that House Thuranni continues to work\nwith the Emerald Claw today.\n\nSince the Schism, the major [[enclave]]s of House Thuranni\nare found in [[Karrnath]] and the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], but Thuranni has also been expanding its operations and has established small enclaves\nin [[Q'barra]] and [[Droaam]].\n\n!!
