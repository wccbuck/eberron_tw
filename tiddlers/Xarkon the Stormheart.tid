Less than a day away from the city of [[Stormreach]] as the dragon flies, a single sandstone spire on a dusty windblown plateau reaches high into an ever-raging tempest. This is the den of Xarkon, also called the Stormheart, a mighty [[blue dragon]] who glares toward the city of Stormreach with fierce hate festering in his soul.

Xarkon’s father Xakolondar was a member of a draconic sect that demanded the destruction of humanity as a solution to the uncertain threat of the
[[dragonmark]]s. When the other [[dragon]]s disagreed,
Xakolondar abandoned [[Argonnessen]] and made a
new home in [[Xen'drik]]. Shortly after [[human]] pirates
made their beachhead at the [[giant]] ruins, Xakolondar took it upon himself to scour them from the face of his home. Captain [[Delera Omaren]], pirate
queen and soon to be [[Storm Lord|Storm Lords]] of [[Stormreach]], felled
the [[blue dragon]]; Lady [[Paulo Omaren]] has long
sought to learn how her ancestor accomplished such
an epic task.

Xarkon was younger then and untested, but he
has grown older and more powerful with each passing
century. Now the dragon is in his prime, and his rage
smolders toward the teeming city built by his father’s
murderer. Xarkon has yet to mount a full attack on
[[Stormreach]], but more than a few raids by [[giant]]s and
[[wyvern]]s are attributed to his influence. The dragon is
a grave threat, but his force of [[stone giant]]s, wyverns,
and [[manticore]]s makes Stormheart an even more dire
menace to the city.
