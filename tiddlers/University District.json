From Morgrave itself to the businesses that have sprung\nup around it, love of learning coexists with love of\nearning and the two feed happily off each other. If\nscholarly interest can lead to great profit, or thirst\nfor gold to historical discovery, then the residents of\nthe University District are doubly satisfied. \n\n!! Noteworthy Locations\n\n* [[Morgrave University]]. Perhaps not the most respectable institution of higher learning in [[Khorvaire]], Morgrave boasts an unparalleled collection of artifacts and scholarly works about ancient [[Xen'drik]] and the [[Dhakaan]] Empire, and is a major patron of adventurers and explorers.\n* [[Art Temple]]. This theater is renowned for its avant-garde techniques and subjects. \n* [[Golden Horn]]. This wealthy inn includes a library, a few large meeting rooms, and a small concert hall. Performing at the Horn is an excellent opportunity for aspiring [[bard]]s.\n* [[Grand Stage]]. This stage hosts grand performances of the beloved classics of [[Galifar]], along with more modern works that follow classical traditions.\n* [[Kavarrah Concert Hall]]. The grand auditorium near the University, Kavarrah Concert Hall hosts the finest musical performances in Sharn. \n* [[Haftak's Books and Binding]]. The [[Sharn Inquisitive]], the city's local chronicle, is printed at this bookstore and bindery.\n* [[Sharn Opera House]]. Performances at the Sharn Opera are one of the most highbrow forms of entertainment in the city. \n* [[Stargazer Theater]]. This open-air theater focuses on popular entertainment with family appeal.
