        "text": "There is a dark power bound beneath the fortress known as [[Turakbar's Fist]], and it has long spread its influence across the barren region now known as [[Droaam]]. Znir [[hwyri]] hunt those who fall too far down its path, while the [[minotaur]] clans see this power as their patron. Tol Kharash can easily be mistaken for the [[Rage of War|Rak Tulkhesh]], as both delight in bloodshed and war. However, Tol Kharash is a force of tyranny rather than rage. It drives the strong to oppress the weak… and the crueler they are, the better. \n\n\"The Horned King\" is the common name of the [[overlord]], and the aspect worshiped by [[Rhesh Turakbar]] and his clan, the [[Blood Horns]]; they raid and pillage in his name. However, each of the major minotaur clans has their own unique interpretation of the Horned King, often sharing aspects with one of the [[Sovereigns|Sovereign Host]] or [[Six|Dark Six]]. By way of these interpretations, Tol Kharash has many other names, including the \"Prince of Beasts\", \"[[He Who Walks Behind|Red Hooves]]\", \"[[One Horn|Blade Breakers]]\", and the \"[[Dawn Gorer|Dawn Harvest]]\".\n\nThe King's greatest servants are possessed mortals as opposed to manifested [[fiend]]s. He has no representatives in [[Ashtakala]] and doesn’t work with the [[Lords of Dust]].",
