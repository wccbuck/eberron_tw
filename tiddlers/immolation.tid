Flames wreathe one creature you can see within 90 feet. If the target can't dodge, it is ignited for up to 1 minute. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and continues to burn for the full minute. These magical flames can't be extinguished by nonmagical means.
