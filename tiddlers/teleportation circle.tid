For the [[spell]] of the same name, see [[teleportation circle (spell)]].

A teleportation circle is a circular fixture, typically around 10 feet in diameter and inscribed with [[arcane|arcane magic]] sigils or imbued with a [[psionic|psionics]] imprint, which enables instantaneous transportation to another circle. 

In [[Khorvaire]], teleportation circles are created and operated by [[dragonmark]]ed members of House [[Orien]], who use their [[Mark of Passage]] to activate a circle and link it to another circle with a known unique sigil sequence. A shimmering portal then opens, and anyone who steps through the portal in the next few seconds arrives at the destination circle. However, only very powerful wielders of the Mark of Passage are able to operate the circles, so the service is expensive. Orien's [[First Step]] program is actively researching how to expand and improve upon teleportation technology.

In [[Riedra]], the [[Inspired]] have built a secret but extensive network of psionic teleportation circles that connect every bastion city and kintam (fortress), through the central hub of [[Durat Tal]]. 

Other, vanished cultures also developed portal rituals and left teleportation circles behind. [[Dragon|dragon]]s, [[demon]]s, the [[wizard]]s of [[Ohr Kaluun]] in [[Sarlona]], the [[giant]]s of [[Xen'drik]]â€”all left teleportation circles in the world, waiting to be found.

Talented [[wizard]]s, [[Orien]] heirs, [[psion]]s, or other such masters of instantaneous translocation can cast a [[rare-tier spell|teleportation circle (spell)]], spending about a minute and expending ritual components worth at least [[5c|money]], to make a makeshift teleportation circle wherever they are and link it to a known circle. The circle vanishes after ten seconds.
