title: tremorsense
tooltip: able to perceive one's surroundings by detecting vibrations
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the creature and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense canâ€™t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as [[ankheg]]s and [[umber hulk]]s, have this special sense.
