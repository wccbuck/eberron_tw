title: clockwork bomb
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A clockwork bomb is a small box, about a foot on a side, covered with springs, dials, gauges, and knobs. It issues an unnerving ticking sound, and vibrates so violently that it moves about. When the timer goes off, the device explodes in a 20-foot radius. Take caution: these devices have been known to detonate prematurely.
