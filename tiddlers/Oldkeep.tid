Once, [[Sharn]]'s [[City Watch|Sharn Watch]] operated out of a great set
of towers and buildings known as the Keep, located
in [[Lower Dura]]. When the City Watch spread out to
[[Daggerwatch]] and the new garrisons springing up
in other, higher-level districts, a number of land
barons bought up the old property and converted
it into housing. Now the place is called Oldkeep, in
memory of its more glorious occupants.

Most of the residents of Oldkeep work in [[Precarious]], the [[Stores]], or in [[Middle Dura]]. Many work for businesses with ties to the [[Boromar Clan]].
Recently, bands of monsters with ties to [[Droaam]]
have begun making surgical strikes in the districtâ€”thugs or burglars appear, hit a target with ties to the
Boromars, and vanish into the [[Cogs]]. The Boromar
Clan has hired [[Deneith]] mercenaries to patrol the
district, but these guards can't be everywhere at
once. While they can handle a few [[gnoll]]s or even an
[[ogre]], these mercenaries have a difficult time dealing
with [[medusa]]s or [[troll]]s.

All trades available in this district are illegal
in nature. While most criminals do business in
other districts, it may be possible to find a fence, a
burglar, or a source for [[dreamlily]] or [[dragon's blood]]
in Oldkeep.
