The menu serves one simple, comforting dish from each of the\n[[Five Nations]], so a [[Karrn|Karrnath]] trader can relax with a bowl of [[Nightwood]] stew and a [[Thrane]] can enjoy flamegrilled [[tribex]]. The Gold Dragon Inn is managed by\nReskal d’[[Ghallanda]], a former [[clawfoot]] wrangler with the scars to back up his stories of capturing dinosaurs barehanded. ",
