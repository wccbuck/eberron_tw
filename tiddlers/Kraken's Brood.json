        "text": "According to House [[Lyrandar]] doctrine, the [[Mark of Storm]] is a blessing granted by [[Arawai]] and [[Kol Korran]], a gift to help the [[Khoravar|half-elf]] prosper (see [[Sela's Path]]). However, a cult hidden within the house believes that the [[Mark of Storm]] is a gift from the [[Devourer]], and that it is intended to be used as a weapon—that the Khoravar are meant to assert their dominion over [[Khorvaire]] with hurricanes and lightning. This sect maintains that their greatest visionaries have become [[kraken]]s who dwell in the deepest waters and guide their followers through visions; as such, they call themselves the //Kraekovar// or “Kraken’s Brood.” \n\nKraekovar heirs learn to use their [[dragonmark]]s in unusual and destructive ways, specializing in lightning. Other Lyrandar heirs say that this represents a fundamental corruption of the dragonmark, and that using the [[mark|Mark of Storm]] as a weapon causes the Kraekovar to become unstable and sociopathic. While the Brood claim that their power ultimately flows from the [[Devourer]], they don’t share any common cause with the [[Three Faces of the Wild]] or other sects; they are loyal to their own immortal [[kraken]] elders and to their vision of a nation ruled by [[Khoravar|half-elf]] storm kings.\n\nSome believe that [[Esravash d'Lyrandar]] is just a figurehead or a dupe, and that the Kraken's Brood is the true power guiding House [[Lyrandar]]. According to these rumors, the cult maintains hidden enclaves throughout coastal [[Khorvaire]], including [[Tlalusk Island]] north of the [[Demon Wastes]].",
