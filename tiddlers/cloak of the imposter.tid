title: cloak of the imposter
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This dark indigo cloak with a tattered, golden hem allows the wearer to create an illusory double of themselves up to three times per day. The double looks, sounds, and smells identical to themselves, and persists up to 1 hour, but the illusion is not solid, and will disappear if touched.
