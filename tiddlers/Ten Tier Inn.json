        "text": "The Ten Tier Inn, one of the most hospitable hostels in [[Sharn]], occupies ten levels in the central portion of [[Lyrandar Tower]]. Rooms range from utilitarian chambers that a traveler on a budget can easily afford to the utterly opulent suites favored by visiting royalty. The most sought-after rooms have windows that look out over the city, and sometimes even balconies that allow guests to hail a [[skycoach]] directly from their rooms. Each such balcony is equipped with a [[feather fall]] passive charm for the guests' protection.\n\nIn addition to sleeping chambers, the inn has two ballrooms. Musicians from throughout the city are sometimes paid to perform at special events presented here. Typically, these rooms are booked up to three months in advance.\n\nThe inn is run by the [[Hostelers Guild]], and is managed by a man named ''Edram Malthus''.\n",
