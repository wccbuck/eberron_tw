Khandan is a local legend who served in the [[Brelish|Breland]] army throughout the [[Last War]]; he was knighted by the [[last king|Jarot ir'Wynarn]] of [[Galifar]] and swore an oath to the [[first queen of Breland|Wroann ir'Wynarn]]. He enjoys drinking and gambling. He takes discipline seriously, though, and expects his soldiers to show complete loyalty to their country and its king. Because of his experiences in the war, he has a deep dislike for [[Thrane]]s and followers of the [[Silver Flame]], but he rarely lets these feelings interfere with his duties. \n\nKhandanâ€™s lieutenants are [[Meira]] and [[Molin Kaine]].\n\nKhandan is the grandnephew of legendary blacksmith [[Golan Dol]].",
