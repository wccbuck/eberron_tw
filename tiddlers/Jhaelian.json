Jhaelian has strong spiritual traditions; its members are deeply devoted to the [[Undying Court]] and to contemplating divine mysteries. This line produces many monks, [[cleric]]s, and [[paladin]]s, as well as many members of the [[Deathguard]]—the Aereni institution dedicated to hunting down [[Mabar]]an [[undead]]. Members of this line have a tradition of using [[cosmetic transmutation]] to adopt a desiccated appearance—not unlike that of the [[deathless]] themselves—though other Jhaelian Aereni prefer to wear masks.",
