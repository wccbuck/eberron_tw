They are a 300-year-old [[elf]] who teaches Vassal History and World Religions.\n\n!! Appearance and Personality \n\nDespite their old age, Master Marrath is sinewy and strong. They are always clean and well-groomed, and are quietly devout. They always correct grammatical errors; they learned how to speak and write [[Common]] nearly 300 years ago, and have strong opinions about popular movements within the language since then, so some of their \"corrections\" might be old-fashioned and outdated.",
