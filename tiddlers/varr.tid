The varr are kind, generous, telepathic [[halfling]]s found in some [[layer]]s of [[Xoriat]]. But they're not quite like their [[Eberron]] cousinsâ€”they have compound eyes, barbed tongues, and they spit acid on food to digest it.

Varr farmers can be found dancing in the [[Fields of Thought]], cultivating emotions.
