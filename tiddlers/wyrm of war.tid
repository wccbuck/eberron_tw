''Sovereigns:'' [[Dol Dorn]], the [[Mockery]]

What combatant can match the deadly power of the [[dragon]]? Wyrms of war are living engines of destruction, capable of scattering armies with ease. The wyrm of war devotes their existence to honing their martial prowess, becoming the ultimate expression of battle.

Wyrms of war follow two possible paths. The pure warrior focuses solely on his martial strength and skill. The traitorâ€™s path encourages the use of deception and trickery in battle, wielding cunning as a weapon.

Like [[lightkeeper]]s, most wyrms of war usually serve the [[Conclave]] or the [[Light of Siberys]]. But a wyrm of war may take pleasure in training the finest [[humanoid]] warriors of their age, or in observing their battles without interfering. A [[rogue|rogue dragon]] wyrm of war could spar with an agent of [[Rak Tulkhesh]], playing a game of [[Conqueror]] with living pawns... but such a dragon would be at dire risk of corruption by the [[Daughter of Khyber|Tiamat]].
