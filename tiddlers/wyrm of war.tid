''Sovereigns:'' [[Dol Dorn]], the [[Mockery]]

What combatant can match the deadly power of the [[dragon]]? Wyrms of war are living engines of destruction, capable of scattering armies with ease. The wyrm of war devotes their existence to honing their martial prowess, becoming the ultimate expression of battle.

Wyrms of war follow two paths. The pure warrior focuses solely on his martial strength and skill. The traitorâ€™s path encourages the use of deception and trickery in battle, wielding cunning as a weapon.
