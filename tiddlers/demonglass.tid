Demonglass is similar to obsidian, but virtually indestructible, and as hard as [[adamantine]]. Buildings from the [[Age of Giants]] civilization that dwelled in the [[Demon Wastes]] were partially made from demonglass, and the demonglass portions are often all that are left standing of the ruins. The "needle teeth" of [[Shargon's Teeth]] in the [[Thunder Sea]] were made from demonglass by the [[Lurker in Shadow]] during the [[Age of Demons]], and can pierce the hull of a swiftly moving ship despite being just a few inches in width. Demonglass can also be found scattered along the northern coast of the [[Demon Wastes]].
