Even lower-echelon agents of the Serpentine Table know little of its structure and membership. Its deep agents have spent centuries establishing their covers.\n\nEvery [[Phiarlan]] [[enclave]] has a liaison that acts as\nthe go-between with the Serpentine Table, but this\nagent knows little of the operations in the city; the\ntrue spymaster will always be hidden. The services of\nthe Table are available by invitation only. Those in a\nposition to benefit from the Table’s services might be\nvisited by the Hydra, who negotiates terms.\n\n!! The Hydra\n\nA potential customer cannot contact\nthe Serpentine Table directly. Instead, the Table\ncontacts the client. Using [[disguise self]], the\nTable’s spokesperson can appear in any number of\nguises, but always refers to themself as the Hydra. It’s possible that there is only one Hydra, but in all likelihood many agents assume this role. A cunning PC could falsely represent themself as the Hydra—but those few known to have done so were\nall assassinated shortly thereafter.",
