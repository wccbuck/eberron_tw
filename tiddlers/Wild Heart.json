        "text": "The Wild Heart is an [[overlord]] associated with [[therianthrope]]s and savage beasts. It reflects the fear of bloodthirsty beasts lurking in the shadows just outside the light of a campfire... and it then transforms natural creatures into these monsters. It is the predator that lurks within, the rabid instincts that lie beneath the surface waiting to be unleashed. It seeks to destroy civilizations, and it feeds on primal cruelty. The surge in the therianthropic curse that led to the [[Silver Crusade]] is thought to have been sparked by this archfiend.\n\nThe //prakhutu// (speaker) of the Wild Heart is known as Drulkalatar Atesh, a [[rakshasa]] currently masquerading as the [[oni]] [[warlord]] [[Drul Kantar]] in [[Droaam]].",
