        "text": "The Wild Heart is an [[overlord]] associated with [[therianthrope]]s and savage [[beast]]s. They reflect the fear of bloodthirsty beasts lurking in the shadows just outside the light of a campfire... and they then transform natural creatures into these monsters. They are the predator that lurks within, the rabid instincts that lie beneath the surface waiting to be unleashed. They seek to destroy civilizations, and they feed on primal cruelty. The surge in the therianthropic curse that led to the [[Silver Crusade]] is thought to have been sparked by this archfiend.\n\nThe [[prakhutu]] of the Wild Heart is known as Drulkalatar Atesh, a [[rakshasa]] currently masquerading as the [[oni]] [[warlord]] [[Drul Kantar]] in [[Droaam]].
