type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The [[Korth]] Enclave of House [[Cannith]] serves as the headquarters of [[Cannith East]]. [[Zorlan d'Cannith]] is nominally in charge of this [[enclave]], but many of [[Jorlanna d'Cannith]]â€™s functionaries (and sometimes Jorlanna herself) spend time in [[Korth]] because the Council of the [[Twelve]] is headquartered here. This walled compound is the site of much scheming among the factions of House [[Cannith]].
