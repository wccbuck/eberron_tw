Some believe he was leading a legion out of [[Metrol]] on the Day of [[Mourning]] and may yet be alive, but his location is unknown. Exporers have been unable to recover not only the war hero's body or banner, but also the legendary flail he carried into battle, [[Hillcrusher]]. \n\nBrillik was not one to shy away from the front lines, and was widely known as a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. He could magically grow himself to the size of a [[giant]], and create great craters in the ground wherever his [[Hillcrusher]] made impact.",
