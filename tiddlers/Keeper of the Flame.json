        "text": "The Keeper of the Flame is the head of the Church of the [[Silver Flame]]. They serve as intermediary between the [[Voice of the Flame|Tira Miron]] and the [[Council of Cardinals]]. The Keeper is not elected, but rather \"called\" by the Voice, a mystical process understood by very few, and then confirmed by the Council. Historically, the Keeper is the only person capable of channeling the power of fountain of fire in the [[Grand Cathedral|Cathedral of the Silver Flame]] in [[Flamekeep]], performing miracles no [[cleric]] or [[paladin]] can match.\n\nThe Keeper wields secular as well as religous power. In 914 YK, the last king of [[Thrane]], [[Thalin ir'Wynarn]], died. The people rejected the claim of King Thalin's heir and installed a [[Silver Flame]] theocracy. Since then, the nation has been led by the Keeper of the Flame and the [[Council of Cardinals]].\n\nThe current Keeper is [[Jaela Daran]], an eleven-year-old girl who was only six when she was confirmed in 993 YK.",
