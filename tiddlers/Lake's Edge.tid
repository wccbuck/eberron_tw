Lake’s Edge is one of two common gathering places for locals in [[Sylbaran]] (the other being the [[Haven|Haven (Sylbaran campsite)]]). It is a stretch of beach on the shores of [[Silver Lake]] north of the Sylbaran docks; fisherfolk who use small boats will often land on Lake’s Edge at the end of the night and trade some of their catch for stories or song. The [[Greensingers]] of Sylbaran primarily camp on Lake’s Edge, and every night at least one of the ‘Singers will lead all comers in song and dance.
