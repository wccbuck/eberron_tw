Tlexolotls (pronounced "tle-shoh-lohtl"), also known as "hellbenders", are gigantic, [[salamander]]-like creatures that slumber deep in the magma of dormant volcanoes. A tlexolotl drowses amid the molten depths for centuries, rising only rarely to gorge itself on massive amounts of animal and plant life before returning to its slumber. Should a tlexolotl's sleep by disturbed—whether by intruders in its volcanic lair or the eruption of its molten home—the lava-drenched brute emerges in a rage, rampaging forth until its belly is full and its volcano is quiet once more.

Despite a tlexolotl's destructive prowess, the land around its volcano is often naturally abundant. It's common for those who live nearby to honor the tlexolotl as a protector of the land, as the ash it creates rejuvenates the soil and encourages life to flourish.

Hellbenders are immune to fire damage and poison, and cannot be petrified. They possess both [[darkvision]] and [[tremorsense]] out to a range of 120 feet. They rapidly recover from injury unless they are subjected to cold damage or are immersed in water. Under extreme duress, a tlexolotl can cause streams of molten lava to erupt from its body, striking creatures as far as 30 feet away.

The first known recorded instance of a tlexolotl encounter was in the [[Fernia]]n [[manifest zone]] known as the [[Cauldron]], located in the [[Kelshak Mountains]] in [[Borunan]], over 2000 years ago. Another hellbender may reside in [[Mount Kapaerian]] on [[Kapaerian Island]] off the coast of [[Xen'drik]].
