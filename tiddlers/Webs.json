        "text": "The Webs of [[Zarash'ak]] stretch beneath and around the outer edge of the city, in\nthe cramped space between the surface of the [[Glum River]]\nand the lowest platforms of the [[Ring]]. The structures\nhere are canopies supported by ropes anchored to the\nplatforms above and the stilts. All of these structures\nare temporary by design, because when flooding is\nbad, the lowest canopies can be swept away. Here the\npoor and the mad mingle with those who enjoy the\nfreedom of a hidden life in the shadows. If you know\nyour way around, the Webs can be the fastest means\nof moving about Zarashâ€™ak, but running the ropes is\ndangerous for anyone who has poor balance or enemies in the deeps.",
