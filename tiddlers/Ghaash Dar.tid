Ghaash Dar is one of the two largest, most permanent fortress-settlements of the [[Ghaash'kala]] in the canyons of the [[Labyrinth]] (the other being [[Maruk Dar]] in the south). No more than a few hundred people dwell in such settlements at a time, since the
Ghaash'kalaâ€™s mission keeps them on the move.
