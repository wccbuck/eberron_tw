It pales in\ncomparison to the great [[Library of Korranberg]], but\na significant number of [[Zilargo]] expatriates live in\n[[Den'iyas]] and work to make the Morgrave Library the\nbest resource it can be.\n\nHistory is clearly a specialty of the University,\nand those using the Morgrave Library for research\ninto the history of [[Sharn]] or [[Xen'drik]] gain two [[advantage]]s on their attempts. The Library offers one [[advantage]] on attempts to research other scholarly topics.\n\nThose without formal ties to Morgrave University must pay a fee of [[1c|money]] per week to conduct research at the Library. Students, alumni, and those working\nfor Morgrave can use the Library for free.",
