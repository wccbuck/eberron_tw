halls, pawnshops, etc. (140)<br/>
''First Impression:'' Noisy crowds fi ll taverns, casinos, and bordellos, the sound of laughter spilling
out onto the dark streets. A great deal seems to be
going on that appears illegal, but everyone seems to
be having a good time.<br/>
''Social Class:'' Lower class<br/>
''Neighbors:'' [[Torchfire]] (north); [[Center Bridge]] (northwest); [[Dragoneyes]] (bridge, southeast); [[Black Arch]] (bridge, south); [[Little Plains]] (above)

The Firelight district caters to clients seeking
entertainment of an intimate nature, as well as
hardcore and casual gamblers. While Sharn's other
red-light districts, [[Sharn's Welcome]] and [[Dragoneyes]], are dangerous and disreputable places most
respectable citizens wouldn't dream of visiting,
Firelight has somehow managed to maintain a
reputation as a socially acceptable place to come and
have fun, whatever type of fun one might be interested in having. Crime is much better controlled in Firelight than in the other red-light districts,
so customers are less likely to become victims.
[[Changelings|changeling]] control most of the bordellos here, as
they do in [[Dragoneyes]], but they employ members
of almost all races.
