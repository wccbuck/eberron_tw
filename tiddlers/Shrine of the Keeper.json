[[Gellis Candar]] ([[dwarf]]) runs a large pawnshop in the [[Bazaar]] in [[Sharn]], and he maintains a shrine to the Keeper in a hidden back\nchamber. A few of the other merchants know of the\nshrine and attend Candar's services, believing that the\nKeeper can help them fulfill their greedy desires. ",
