type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Lorghalan is a large island in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], home to the [[Fleet of Lorghalan]]. The island is dominated by a powerful [[manifest zone]] to [[Lamannia]].

Lorghalan was originally settled by [[gnomish|gnome]] explorers fleeing [[Zilargo]] after the founding of the [[Trust]]. The island's proximity to the primal forces of [[Lamannia]] cause the land itself to seem alive. Lorghalan has the highest concentration of [[elemental]]s anywhere on Eberron with the exception of the [[wild zone]]s of [[Sarlona]]; in fact, the nearby [[Hammer]] island is actually a gigantic [[earth elemental]]. The leaders of the expedition to the island had long studied elementals and had developed [[primal magic]] techniques to live in harmony, and eventually, even convince the spirits and beasts of the wild island to work with them. Rather than [[binding elementals|elemental binding]], the Lorghalan [[stonesinger]]s communed directly with the spirits and convinced them to help. A Lorghalan ship might be literally pushed by a cooperative [[water elemental]], not powered by a bound one as in an [[elemental galleon]].

Today, the descendants of these explorers are recognized as an [[independent principality|Fleet of Lorghalan]]. The [[gnome]]s of Lorghalan share much in common with their [[Zil|Zilargo]] cousins, with one key exception: Lorghali value freedom and honesty above all, and despise secrets. All gnomes of the island consider themselves to be of one house, so one may introduce themselves as "Tara Tan Lorghalan".

!! The Island of Lorghalan

Lorghalan is poised on the edge of [[Lamannia]]. Most [[elemental]]s on Lorghalan are spirits of earth and water, but some are storms that follow paths of their own choosing or pits of endless fire. These elementals are creatures of Lamannia, pure and inhuman; there are no [[dao]] or [[marid]]s here. The deep jungle is home to megafauna [[beast]]s, and off the coast of Lorghalan, sailors occasionally spot [[roc]]s hunting whales.

Glancing at a map of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], one might wonder why Lorghalan was uninhabited when the [[gnome]]s claimed it. But the island is surrounded by dire threats. To the island’s west, the [[Tempest Strait]] is lashed by storms as powerful as any found in the [[Thunder Sea]]. To the southwest, [[Dreadwood Isle]] lies close to [[Mabar]] and [[Dolurrh]], and strange [[ghost]]s and hungry [[shadow]]s lurk in the depths of its [[Dreadwood]]. Lorghalan’s northern coastline is lined with hidden reefs and unusual stone outcroppings, and even the most careful of captains can find their ship unexpectedly
dashed against the rocks—thanks to the many [[water elemental]]s that dwell along the coast.

The safest landing is at [[Hammer Bay]] to the south, but to get there, ships must pass the island that shares its name... and the [[Hammer]] isn’t a natural island, but a massive [[earth elemental]]. It never ventures far from its mapped position, but it has no love of ships; any vessel that draws too close may be shattered by a hurled stone or a mighty fist. Though it’s possible [[airship]]s might reach the island safely, they’ve only been in operation for about a decade—and airships rely on docking towers that the [[gnome]]s, quite happy with their [[fleet|Fleet of Lorghalan]], have proven uninterested in constructing.

!!! The Lorghalan Expedition

[[Gnome|gnome]] explorers had chronicled the island’s threats long ago, so the gnomes who sailed east knew what to expect. The Lorghalan expedition included sages specializing in [[elemental]]s and [[Lamannia]], and were able to convince the [[Hammer]] to let them
approach the island. Upon landing, they established the town of [[Hornstone]] on the shore of [[Hammer Bay]].

Exploring the island, the gnomes found it truly was a reflection of the raw primal power of [[Lamannia]]. The land was bountiful, fresh water was plentiful, and much of the island was truly alive. Stones rolled of their own accord. The earth intermittently rumbled. What seemed to be a peaceful pond might unexpectedly move to a new location. Living storms lashed the coasts, while gargantuan beasts prowled the jungles. 

The colonists came prepared with [[primal magic]] techniques to reason with the spirits of the land and persuade them to live in harmony. After securing the region surrounding [[Hornstone]], the [[gnome]] colonists and their descendants continued to develop and hone these techniques, and today the Lorghalan [[stonesinger]]s can convince the beasts and elementals not only to coexist but to work together with the gnomes.

!! People of Lorghalan

[[Gnomes|gnome]] comprise the vast majority of the island’s population, though a few other folk have immigrated there over the years. Lorghalan gnomes share some traits with their [[Zil|Zilargo]] cousins: they love clever oratory and prefer to solve their problems with words instead of swords. But where the gnomes of [[Zilargo]] dive deep into intrigue, Lorghalan bases its society on freedom and honesty. The founders of [[Hornstone]] swore there would be no secrets on their island; all knowledge would be shared and all problems drawn into the light, not eliminated in the shadows.

As mentioned earlier, [[gnome]]s of Lorghalan all consider themselves to be of one house. In the same way a [[Zil|Zilargo]]'s three names will indicate their name, family, and house (e.g. "Talia Lorridan Lyrris" is Talia of the Lorridan family in House Lyrris), the three names of Lorghali gnomes indicate name and family followed by "Lorghalan".

The Lorghali produce excellent mediators, apothecaries, and farmers, but what makes them truly remarkable is their tradition of [[primal magic]] and their relationship with the [[elemental]]s of the region. While this [[stonesinging|stonesinger]] is a unique tradition that plays a central role in Lorghalan culture, the [[gnome]]s have nothing against other forms of magic; in particular, Lorghalan [[alchemist]]s perform many wonders using the unusual plants of their island. The original immigrant families included a handful of dissidents from House [[Sivis]], and while the Lorghali have made no particular effort to cultivate the [[Mark of Scribing]], a few gnomes in each generation still manifest the [[mark|dragonmark]]; such gnomes often become the most gifted [[wizard]]s of the island.

!!! Lorghalan Society

Though the Lorghali dissolved their ties to [[Zilargo]], local family units remain important to them. Each family maintains an estate—a farming village based around a central communal building. Every estate specializes in different crops and skills, and [[Hornstone]] is where they all come together. The island economy is largely driven by barter and the exchanging of favors, though families do maintain funds for dealing with the world beyond Lorghalan. All families have lodging in Hornstone, and each family has three representatives on the Hornstone Council, which governs the island and mediates disputes.

Like other [[principalities|Lhazaar Principalities]], Lorghalan has its own prince, but they hold significantly less power among their people than do other Lhazaar princes. The gnomes recognize the Prince of Lorghalan as the cleverest on the island, and as such, someone whose voice should always be heard and opinion considered. But the prince has no power beyond that, and any Lorghali can claim the title by defeating the current prince in a series of duels of wit and strategy. Sometimes decades go by with no challenges; other times, challenges are a weekly or daily occurrence. The young Prince [[Shasi Stormlyn]] recently claimed the title, and she’s been urging a dramatic course of action. The GM must decide just what this is: does Shasi want to work more closely with Rygar to establish a powerful, united Lhazaar? Does she want to see a new High Prince rise to power? Or does she want the Lorghali to shun political change?

!!! Lorghalan Religion

The [[gnome]]s of Lorghalan live in a land that's literally alive with spirits, so it’s little surprise their religious traditions are practical and animistic. The Lorghali refer to the world beyond the island as the “deadlands”; they find it depressing to wander in realms where the wind and waves aren’t singing back to them. The gnomes regularly interact with exceptionally powerful entities, including [[elemental]]s like the [[Hammer]] and legendary megafauna [[beast]]s. So the Lorghali don’t put their faith in distant, abstract deities; instead, they focus on concrete, local spirits.

The Lorghali respect nature, but more concretely so than a [[druid]] who reveres [[Eberron]] as a whole; after all, the Lorghali have a personal relationship with the well that provides their water and the boulder that rolls by every day. They celebrate festivals in which the greater spirits are invoked, but none of their practices focus on “faith”—theirs is a practical, concrete relationship, and spellcasters tend toward [[primal magic]] instead of [[divine|divine magic]]. They have a very relaxed attitude toward death and the afterlife, focused instead on living their best life; when it’s over, it’s over, and whatever happens next will happen. Their traditions are essentially the opposite of those of [[Aerenal]] and faiths that center on avoiding [[Dolurrh]]; at the end of the day, the Lorghali don’t care what happens after death, as long as they live a good life.

!!! Lorghalan and the World

The [[gnome]]s of Lorghalan generally have little interest in dealing with the outside world, and they consider it to be a dangerous place driven by greed and dishonesty. However, some gnomes are drawn beyond the island either by sheer curiosity, the challenge of matching wits with a dangerous world, or the need to obtain resources or techniques unavailable on Lorghalan. Most Lorghali strive to remain true to the principles of their culture even in hostile lands, solving problems through open discussion rather than treachery and subterfuge. But they aren’t fools; a Lorghalan gnome won’t spill every secret to a stranger, and if they don’t want to lie, they don’t have to say anything at all.

Because of the dangers posed by the [[Hammer]], the primary way to reach [[Hornstone]] is on a [[Lorghalan ship|Fleet of Lorghalan]]. The Lorghali are largely gracious hosts and
curious [[gnome]]s are often eager to talk to outsiders, but the gnomes are aware that outsiders don’t share their traditions of honesty, so they watch strangers with both
eyes. Over the last century, an increasing number of
[[Zil|Zilargo]] have reached out to Lorghalan. The islanders are
especially suspicious of their cousins and do not trust the [[Trust]], but they’ve cautiously engaged in cultural exchange; notably, Lorghalan [[stonesinging|stonesinger]] techniques fascinate some Zil, which has led to the rise of the [[Power of Purity]] movement in Zilargo.

!! Lorghalan Adventures

Here are a few ideas of what might bring adventurers to this isolated island or cause a [[stonesinger]] to cross their path.

* //''Elemental Rights.''// The Lorghali have forged an alliance with the [[Power of Purity]] and the [[Ashbound]] [[druid]]s, launching a concerted effort to disrupt Zilargo’s [[elemental binding]] industry and sabotage [[elemental vessel]]s. Is this just a matter of principle, or do they know a terrible secret that could lead to a far worse catastrophe?
* //''It’s a Jungle Out There.''// The deep jungles of Lorghalan hold many wonders: megafauna [[beast]]s, massive [[elemental]]s, plants charged with the energies of [[Lamannia]]. Adventurers are sent to Lorghalan to obtain something—perhaps a [[Cannith]] [[alchemist]] needs a legendary berry, or an [[Aurum]] showman wants them to capture a megafauna beast. Can they get past the [[Hammer]]? Will the Lorghali interfere with their quest?
* //''Lamannian Gateway.''// When adventurers stumble through a [[manifest zone]] to [[Lamannia]], they reemerge in Lorghalan. What do they find as they seek a way home?
* //''Mysterious Marauder.''// The Lorghali dislike deception and rarely engage in piracy—but a Lorghalan warship has begun terrorizing the region around the [[Dreadwood]], supported by a host of [[elemental]]s. Who is this pirate and what are their motives?
* //''Princemakers.''// While [[Lorghalan’s fleet|Fleet of Lorghalan]] is small, its ships are fast and powerful. Lorghali don’t usually concern themselves with the politics of the [[Lhazaar Principalities]], but in the wake of the [[Treaty of Thronehold]], what role might they play in securing the position of the High Prince?

!! Lorghalan Characters

When creating a Lorghalan adventurer, consider what calls you away from home. Most islanders are quite content in their elemental paradise—what’s driven you into the deadlands of [[Khorvaire]]? The table below provides inspiration.

| !<<dr d8>> |!Reason for Leaving Lorghalan |
| 1 |''Curiosity.'' After growing up on an isolated island, you want to see everything. You’re delighted by new experiences. |
| 2 |''Accident.'' You never intended to leave Lorghalan, but an accident involving a [[Lamannia]]n [[manifest zone]] stranded you far from home. |
| 3 |''Following the Wind.'' You’re guided by whispers of [[elemental]] spirits. You’re not entirely sure what they’re trying to tell you, but you need to do something far from home. |
| 4 |''Servant of the Council.'' You’re an envoy of the Council of [[Hornstone]]. Are you gathering information about [[Khorvaire]]? Seeking allies? Searching for trade opportunities? |
| 5 |''Fame.'' You deserve to be known and celebrated for your achievements—and one day, you’re sure you will be. |
| 6 |''The Zil Connection.'' You’re pursuing a quest tied to your ancient [[Zil|Zilargo]] roots. Are you working with the [[Power of Purity]]? Trying to reconnect with your family in [[Zilargo]]? Investigating a [[Trust]] scheme targeting Lorghalan? |
| 7 |''Following the Song.'' You’re working on a song and you need to travel to find your inspiration. Once it’s done, you’ll return home, but that could take years. |
| 8 |''Exile.'' You were exiled to the deadlands after committing an unforgivable crime. What did you do? Are you seeking redemption or revenge? |
