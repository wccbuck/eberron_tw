Lorghalan is a large island in the [[Lhazaar Principalities]]. The island is dominated by a powerful [[manifest zone]] to [[Lamannia]].  

Lorghalan was originally settled by [[gnomish|gnome]] explorers fleeing [[Zilargo]] after the founding of the [[Trust]]. The island's proximity to the primal forces of [[Lamannia]] cause the land itself to seem alive. Lorghalan has the highest concentration of [[elemental]]s anywhere on Eberron with the exception of the [[wild zone]]s of [[Sarlona]]; in fact, the nearby [[Hammer]] island is actually a gigantic earth elemental. The leaders of the expedition to the island had long studied elementals, and had developed [[primal magic]] techniques to live in harmony and even convince the spirits and beasts of the wild island to work with them. Rather than [[binding elementals|elemental binding]], the Lorghalan stonesingers communed directly with the spirits and convinced them to help. A Lorghalan ship might be literally pushed by a cooperative water [[elemental]], not powered by a bound one as in an [[elemental galleon]].

Today, the descendants of these explorers are recognized as an independent principality. The [[gnome]]s of Lorghalan share much in common with their [[Zil|Zilargo]] cousins, with one key exception: Lorghali value freedom and honesty above all, and despise secrets. All gnomes of the island consider themselves to be of one house, so one may introduce themselves as "Tara Tan Lorghalan".
