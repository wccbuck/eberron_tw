The civilization of the [[elves|elf]] began on [[Xen'drik]] during the [[Age of Giants]]. For thousands of years, most of the elves were slaves of the mighty [[giant]]s of that continent. In time the elves rose up against their masters, but this was a war that no one would win. At the height of the conflict, a visionary named Aeren foresaw the
coming cataclysm. Aeren was not known for their deeds during the war, like heroes such as [[Vadallia]] and [[Cardaen]], but was responsible for the salvation of the elf people. They gathered a host of elves and convinced them to flee the coming storm. As [[dragon]]fire and terrible magic shattered [[Xen'drik]], the elf fleet landed on the island that would become their homeâ€”but their prophet did not survive the journey. Aeren was interred within the island, and the elves named their new home [[Aerenal]], or "Aeren's Rest." 

Aeren's vision united the elves, but with the prophet's death, they split apart. Three factions developed, and each pursued their own path to ensure they never lost their greatest champions. The [[Aereni]] spent centuries researching the [[Irian]] [[manifest zone]]s of [[Aerenal]] and eventually learned to create the [[deathless]]. The [[Tairnadal]] preserved their heroes by serving as mortal avatars for their spirits. And the line of [[Vol]], which traced its roots to the [[Qabalrin]], perfected their techniques of [[Mabar]]an [[necromancy]], preserving their greatest as [[vampire]]s, [[lich]]es, and [[oathbound|mummy]].
