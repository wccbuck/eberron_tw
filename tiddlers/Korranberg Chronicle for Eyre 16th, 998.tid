!! Mournland Incursion Devastates Village

[[VATHIROND|Vathirond]]—A horde of [[ghoul]]s attacked the village of Janwell and killed scores of villagers last Sar. Augmenting the marauders' strength were numerous magical conflagrations known as [[living spell]]s.

The attack began at dusk and continued throughout the night. By morning, the village had fallen, and most of its people lay dead. At first light, however, the marauders slipped back into the [[dead-gray mists]] on the border of the [[Mournland]].

Among the slain were local lord Orina ir'Ghalaro and the staff of a chapel devoted to the Church of the [[Silver Flame]]. Most of the survivors were villagers who had taken shelter in a forest to the west at the first sign of trouble.

The marauders included a massive [[construct]] known as a cadaver collector. The name seems to be something of a misnomer, however, since the construct doesn't limit its harvest to corpses.

Rhennek ir'Tallon, the region's representative to the [[Breland Parliament]], offered condolences to the families of the slain and promised that their deaths would be avenged. "I visited Janwell just last year for the apple harvest festival," ir'Tallon said, "and never have I seen a more pleasant hamlet. All our hearts go out to the families of those who lost their lives in this senseless attack."

But ir'Tallon did not stop with mere sympathy. He indicated that within the week he would bring a plan before Parliament to put more soldiers on [[Breland]]'s border with the [[Mournland]].

Periodic incursions from the Mournland are a fact of life in far eastern [[Breland]], but survivors indicated that this attack was another matter entirely. "Once or twice a month, some nasty beast comes out of the mists—a [[carcass crab]] or some other horrible creature," said guard captain Aorolo Roklins. "But this attack was far beyond the norm. The marauders were organized and completely ruthless. However, they didn't loot any valuables, and property damage was minor."

!! Brideveil Waterfall Reverses Course

[[MOONWATCH|Moonwatch]], [[BRELAND|Breland]]—The mysterious magical phenomena afflicting western [[Breland]] have reappeared in dramatic fashion, as the Brideveil Waterfall started flowing upward on Far.

The rest of the [[Graymoon River]] continues to flow in its usual direction, with only the water within a half-mile of the waterfall heading upstream. Local observers said the water itself appears normal, and some enterprising anglers have even caught some trout from the pools below the waterfall.

The scenic waterfall at the headwaters of the Graymoon has religious significance for local [[druid]]s, who have seasonal ceremonies there. But druid leader Skytalon said that she’s as baffled as anyone else by the reversed waterfall.

“I urge patience and calm,” she said. “Surely the meaning of the current strangeness will reveal itself in time. The natural world often reveals its secrets like a rose unfurling its petals.”

The waterfall’s reversal has no overt connection to other strange phenomena in western [[Breland]] this spring, including:

* Clouds forming strange sigils in the sky over [[Ardev]] in Eyre.
* Every apple grown within two days’ travel of [[Ringbriar]] tasting normal but developing bright blue skin.
* Deer and elk dropping their antlers—normal in autumn but unheard of in spring.
* The utter disappearance of the Chaarkia Woods south of [[Ardev]].
* Unusually high tides along [[Breland]]’s southwest coast.

!! Revival of Q’barran Wyvern Hunt Takes 12 Wyverns

[[NEWTHRONE|Newthrone]]—For the first time since the start of the [[Last War]], aristocrats from across [[Khorvaire]] traveled to [[Q'barra]] this month to hunt the reclusive, deadly silver [[wyvern]]s.

The wyverns, possessed of uncommon cunning and a virulent poison, claimed 16 lives among the forty teams of hunters assembled at the invitation of King [[Sebastes ir'Kesslan]].

But with a record 12 [[wyvern]]s taken during the hunt, ir’Kesslan declared the hunt a “resounding success.”

In a decree from the under-construction royal manor at [[Adderport]], ir’Kesslan singled out three teams in particular for their hunting prowess.

A group led by [[Aundair]]’s Thonan ir’Barandeau claimed the largest [[wyvern]]—one with a wingspan measuring 28 feet.

House [[Deneith]]’s team, led by Ruhillia d’Deneith, presented the king with the first wyvern-head, acquired after only six hours of hunting.

And a hunter from the [[Eldeen Reaches]] known only as “Thousand” presented the king with a silver wyvern that he said he hunted without the aid of a team. His claim was obviously unverifiable, but King ir’Kesslan lavished praise on him in the decree.

Royal courtiers said the king was sufficiently pleased with the [[wyvern]] hunt that he planned on making it an annual event, as it was in the days of old [[Galifar]]. Persistent rumors further indicate that the king may don hunting garb and join the other hunters in the field next year.
