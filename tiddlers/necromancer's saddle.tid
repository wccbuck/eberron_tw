title: necromancer's saddle
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When you place this saddle on the corpse or skeleton of a horse-sized creature, you can animate it as an [[undead]] mount. The undead creature's bones and flesh shift as necessary to create something similar in shape to a riding horse, which follows your mental commands as long as you are riding it. The effect lasts until you remove the saddle, or until the next dawn. When the effect ends, the undead creature crumbles into dust.
