!! Mror Holds: Birthplace of Abomination!

It's been exactly seventy years since the [[Iron Council]]
declared the [[Mror Holds]]' independence from [[Karrnath]].
King [[Kaius II|Kaius ir'Wynarn II]] was newly seated on the steel throne and
lacked the resolve to bring the [[dwarf]] lords to heel. Now
we see the harvest we have sown, and it is horrifying.
Without the firm hand of [[Karrnath]] to keep them on
a righteous path, the Mror [[dwarves|dwarf]] have embraced
foul powers.

Witness Lord Malus [[Soldorak]], seen in [[Korth]] this week
for trade negotiations. His [[breastplate|living armor]] was forged from
chitin and muscle, and it seemed to pulse with its own
heartbeat. A guard present at the event said that Soldor­ak's axe moaned when the blade came close to him, as if
the weapon hungered for [[human]] blood.

This is what springs from our mercy and forbearance.
Who knows what horrors the dwarves are crafting—or
breeding—in their mountain halls? We cannot stand
by and let this vileness continue. For the good of our
nation, we call on all true [[Karrn|Karrnath]]s to demand that Regent
[[Moranna|Moranna ir'Wynarn]] unleash our full might on the [[Mror Holds]] and
cleanse this horror!
