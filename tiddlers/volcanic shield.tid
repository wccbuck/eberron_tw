This heavy steel shield burns with an internal fire, and deals additional [[fire damage|damage type]] when you bash enemies with it. In addition, the bearer of this shield can cause it to belch forth smoke (as a [[smokestick]]) at will. Finally, once per day, the bearer of the shield can cause it to erupt, shooting flames in a 15-foot cone.
