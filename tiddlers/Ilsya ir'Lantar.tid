Ilsya [[ir'Lantar|ir'Lantar family]], mother-in-law of Countess [[Tesyn ir'Lantar]], is an enigmatic figure, said to be a seer or enchantress of some power
who advises the countess and runs some of Tesynâ€™s
personal errands. 

The truth is too awful for anyone to have even imagined it. Ilsya has been dead for years, and her corpse is possessed by a [[dybbuk]] bound to Countess Tesyn.
