title: frost buckler
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When a creature you can see attacks you at close range and you block with this icy shield, you can choose to blast the attacking creature with an icy wind that deals a bit of cold damage. After the attack, an icy protective barrier forms around you; you gain an extra temporary [[harm]] box that lasts for up to 1 minute. Once this property of the buckler has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
