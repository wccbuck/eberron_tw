# Welcome to the Eberron Tiddlywiki!

[Eberron Tiddlywiki at Tiddlyhost](https://eberron.tiddlyhost.com/)

## What is this?

[Eberron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberron): A campaign setting for D&D designed for telling fantastical pulp and noir stories.

[Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/): A non-linear notebook for organizing complex information. It runs as a single html document that you can run in a browser and save and edit locally, even without an internet connection!

I ([Will](https://www.reddit.com/u/ziphion)) created this tool to be a reference for myself when running and planning tabletop roleplaying games in the Eberron universe using my work-in-progress Storyloom system. It pulls from Eberron material dating all the way back to the original campaign guide from 2004, as well as a wide variety of D&D sourcebooks and other roleplaying supplements. For the full list of references, see References. Because I intend to use this material with my own roleplaying system, most (if not all) direct references to D&D mechanics have been removed and, if necessary, replaced with Storyloom mechanics.

Keep in mind that much of this material has been altered, in small or large ways, in order to match my own preferences or my own vision of an internally consistent Eberron. Some examples:

* In some cases, I renamed places that had the same name, e.g. the "Graywall" district of Sharn has been renamed "Grawand" (from "grau wand"="gray wall" in German) to avoid confusion with not-so-distant Graywall. In other cases, I kept the names as written, e.g. the Cornerstone district of Sharn and Cornerstone (Kythri city) have little to no overlap—though the Lorghalan Cornerstone was one too many Cornerstones for me, so I renamed that one Hornstone.
* I have also renamed characters whose very-similar-sounding names would lead to confusion. In Sharn, Caskar Halavik is a city councilor friendly to Boromar Clan; "Cask" is the Boromar Clan's chief alchemist, and "Castar" is the Boromar Clan's intelligence expert. If one is running a campaign heavily featuring the Boromars, these names are just too similar. I have renamed Cask "Mig" and Castar "Korbis Kan Nezzelech".
* I have rewritten large chunks of older material pertaining to the Blood of Vol, the Emerald Claw, and Lady Illmarrow to align with more recent writings on these topics.
* Almost all listed city populations are, in my mind, far too small. In many ways, the world of Eberron reflects a level of civilization and (magical) technology akin to the 19th century in our world, and I believe city populations should reflect that. I have multiplied most populations by 5 or more.
* New as of version 1.22.0: The canon timeline of Eberron is kind of absurd. Keith Baker himself has said many times that if he could make any significant change to the world of Eberron, he would shorten the scale of history. As an example, the Empire of Dhakaan canonically lasts 11,000 years. That's the same length as the entirety of human history in our world! Thus, I've made the decision to shorten the timeline in this document. All years older than 1300 years ago are adjusted using the following equation:
    * Adjusted year = √(2600*(original year - 650))

This document is a mostly complete database of all things Eberron, and I still periodically add to it. However, please note that I have deliberately omitted certain content which I feel to be antithetical to the core concept of the setting as laid out by [Keith Baker](http://keith-baker.com). Among the excluded content are large swaths of the books *Five Nations*, *Forge of War*, *Explorer's Handbook*, *Faiths of Eberron*, and other core canon Eberron materials.

## How do I use this?

Using Tiddlywiki might take some getting used to; reading this [short tutorial](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/tiddlywiki) might help you find your footing. Note that while the site works fine on mobile, it was designed for desktop.

I've also added a two-column plugin, so you can have two "story rivers" side by side. Shift-click a link to open it in the opposite column, or click the "divert" button on the title bar (looks like an arrow curving left or right) to push a page to the opposite column. Hide or show the right column by going to the "open" tab of the sidebar and clicking the "columns" button at the bottom of the section.

As for checking out the tons and tons of Eberron content in this database, I'd start with the **Map** in the sidebar if you haven't already!

**Find Things** is a great way to locate specific pages based on category, or even open a random page based on your search terms. If you don't find what you're looking for, you can try the search bar at the top of the page or in the sidebar.

**Modern Age** is a rundown of major events in the world (particularly within Khorvaire) over the last 5000 years. Pick an event, and then just start link hopping!

Feel free to save a snapshot of this site at any time and edit absolutely anything you want to! If ever you want to update your local copy to the latest version, just use the Eberron TW Updater.
